  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat kind of comet is this?\n\nLast week, NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/index.shtml\">EPOXI spacecraft</a> \nwhizzed past \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/103P/Hartley\">Comet 103P/Hartley</a>, \nalso known as Comet Hartley 2, and \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IlnueAk1dM\">recorded images</a> \nand data that are both strange and fascinating.\n\nEPOXI was near its closest approach -- about 700 kilometers away -- when it snapped the \n<a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/3gallery/20101104_Five_c.shtml\">above picture</a>.\n\nAs expected, the comet has indeed \n<a href=\"ap101105.html\">shown itself</a> to be a tumbling iceberg \norbiting the Sun between Earth and Jupiter.\n\nHowever, unexpected features on the images have raised many questions.\n\nFor example, where are all the craters?\n\nWhy is there a large smooth area around the middle?\n\nHow much of \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/index.html\">Comet Hartley 2</a> \nis a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile\">loose pile</a> \nof dust and ice shards?\n\nFuture analyses and comparisons to \n<a href=\"ap070422.html\">other</a> comet \n<a href=\"ap100726.html\">nuclei</a> may answer some of these questions and, hopefully, lead to a better general understanding of comets, meteors, and the \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\">early Solar System</a>.",
