  "title": "The Clash of NGC 3256",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMarked by an unusually bright central region, swirling dust lanes,\nand far flung tidal tails, peculiar NGC 3256 is the aftermath of a\n<a href=\"http://spacetelescope.org/news/heic1811/\">truly\ncosmic collision</a>.\n\nThe 500 million year old clash of two separate galaxies spans\nsome 100 thousand light-years in\n<a href=\"http://spacetelescope.org/images/heic1811a/\">this\nsharp Hubble view</a>.\n\nOf course when two galaxies collide, individual stars rarely do.\n\nGiant galactic clouds of\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05941\">molecular gas</a>\nand dust do interact though, and produce spectacular bursts of\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03577\">star formation</a>.\n\nIn this\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/\">galaxy clash</a>,\nthe two original spiral galaxies had similar masses.\n\nTheir disks are no longer distinct and the two galactic nuclei\nare hidden by obscuring dust.\n\nOn the timescale of a few hundred million years the nuclei\nwill likely also merge\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/image/2318/news_release/2008-16\">as\nNGC 3256</a> becomes a single large elliptical galaxy.\n\nNGC 3256 itself is nearly 100 million light-years distant toward\nthe southern sailing constellation Vela.\n\nThe frame includes many even more distant background galaxies and\nspiky foreground stars.",
