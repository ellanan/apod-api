  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's different about this Moon?\n\nIt's the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)\">terminator</a>s.\n\nIn the featured image, you can't directly see any \n<a href=\"ap180522.html\">terminator</a> -- \nthe line that divides the light of day from the dark of night.\n\nThat's because the image is a digital composite of 29 near-terminator lunar strips. \n\nTerminator regions show the longest and most \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/c4/a9/1ec4a9503ab9fdfaede7f3a6b93e5ba0--light-and-shadow-cat-silhouette.jpg\">prominent shadow</a>s -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear three-dimensional.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4768\">original images</a> \nand data were taken near the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">Moon</a> \nby NASA's \n<a href=\"https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>. \n\nMany of the Moon's \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/impact-crater/en/\">craters</a> \nstand out because of the \n<a href=\"ap211125.html\">shadow</a>s they all cast to the right.\n\nThe image shows in graphic detail that the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare#/media/File:Moon_names.svg\">darker regions known as maria</a> are not just darker than the rest of the \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/resources/moon-map/\">Moon</a> -- they are flatter.",
