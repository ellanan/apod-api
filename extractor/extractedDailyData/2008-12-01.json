  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow massive can stars be?\n\nBig, hefty stars live short violent lives that can profoundly affect their environments.  \n\nIsolating a massive star can be problematic, however, since what seems to be a single \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars\">bright star</a> might actually turn out to be \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">several stars close</a> together.\n\nSuch was the case for two of the brightest objects visible in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_star_cluster\">open star cluster</a> \n<a href=\"ap000613.html\">Trumpler 16</a>, located in the southern \n<a href=\"ap071027.html\">Carina Nebula</a>.\n\nUpon close inspection by the \n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf-Rayet_star\">WR</a> 25, \nthe brightest object in the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0822.html\">above image</a>, was confirmed to consist of at least two separate stars.  \n\nAdditionally, Tr16 -244, just to the upper right of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...460..777G\">WR 25</a>, was resolved for the first time to be at least three individual stars.  \n\nEven so, the brightest star in \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...445.1093P\">WR 25</a> appears to be about 50 times the mass of our Sun, making it one of the more massive stars known.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/Astronomy/SteWin.html\">Winds</a> from these stars are likely significant contributers to the \n<a href=\"ap070714.html\">large bubble</a> that the star cluster sits in.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0822b.html\">Carina Nebula</a>, home to unusually shaped\n<a href=\"ap030630.html\">dust clouds</a> and the famous \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/variable_stars/\">variable star</a> \n<a href=\"ap060326.html\">Eta Carina</a>, lies about 7,500 \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year\">light years</a> \naway toward the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel\">Ship's Keel</a> (<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/carina.html\">Carina</a>).",
