  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA new constellation has taken hold of the sky, \nmuch to the surprise of many\n<a href=\"ap020813.html\">sky gazers</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.paradisepark.org.uk/news/ollie.htm\">Ollie the Owl</a> has suddenly started\ndominating the southern hemisphere, as shown above.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/history/exhibits/constellations/\">constellation</a> is taking the place of \n<a href=\"http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/K/KiplingRudyard/prose/JustSoStories/chap3_rhinoskin.html\">Wrinkles the Rhinoceros</a>, \nwho was unexpectedly voted off the sky by the other constellations.  \n\nHappy <a href=\"http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/top100.html\">April Fools day</a> from the folks at \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a>!  \n\nPictured above, a bird was photographed taking the \n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~david/tasca.htm\">Tololo All Sky Camera</a> (TASCA) as a perch, \na situation that would be even funnier if the \nbird's talons hadn't scratched the plastic enclosing dome.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~david/camera.htm\">TASCA</a> continues to monitor the \n<a href=\"http://concam.net/\">entire night sky</a> as visible from the\n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/\">Cerro Tololo Inter-american Observatory</a> located in \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ci.html\">Chile</a>.  \n\nGiven the unusual vantage point, one guess is that the bird is a \n<a href=\"http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/framlst/i3750id.html\">Great Horned</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.owlpages.com/\">Owl</a>, although it is hoped \nthat a properly under-schooled\n<a href=\"http://www.birding.com/Ornithology.asp\">ornithologist</a> can \n<a href=\"mailto:hschwarz@ctio.noao.edu.AddedtoAvoidSpamPleaseDelete\">e-mail Dr. Schwarz</a> with the bird's true species.",
