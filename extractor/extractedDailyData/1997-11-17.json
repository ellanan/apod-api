  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens when a \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a> hits the ground?  \nUsually nothing much, as most \n<a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/meteor_shower.html\">meteors</a> are small, and  indentations they make are soon eroded away.  \n49,000 years ago, however, a large meteor created \n<a href=\"http://www.etsimo.uniovi.es/solar/cap/earth/meteor.htm\">Barringer Meteor Crater</a> in Arizona, pictured above.  \n<a href=\"http://www.meteorite.com/meteor_crater/\">Barringer</a> \nis over a kilometer across.  \nIn 1920, it was the first feature on Earth to be recognized as an \n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/publications/slidesets/impacts.html\">impact crater</a>.  Today, over 100 \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/tercrate.htm\">terrestrial impact \ncraters</a> have been identified.  Early this morning, the \n<a href=\"ap971116.html\">Leonid Meteor Shower</a> reaches its peak, \nalthough no impacts of this magnitude are expected.",
