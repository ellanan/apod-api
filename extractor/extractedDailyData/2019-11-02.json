  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap101126.html\">The Flame Nebula</a>\nstands out in this optical image of the dusty, crowded\nstar forming regions\n<a href=\"ap131212.html\">toward Orion's belt</a>,\na mere 1,400 light-years away.\n\nX-ray data from the Chandra Observatory and infrared images from\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/podcasts/hd/\nindex.html#pod080514_hd\">can take you inside</a> the\nglowing gas and obscuring dust clouds though.\n\nSwiping your cursor (or clicking the image) will reveal\nmany stars of the recently formed, embedded cluster\nNGC 2024, ranging in age from 200,000 years to 1.5 million years young.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/flame/\">The\nX-ray/infrared\ncomposite image</a> overlay spans about 15 light-years\nacross the Flame's center.\n\nThe X-ray/infrared data also indicate that the youngest stars are\nconcentrated near the middle of the Flame Nebula cluster.\n\nThat's the opposite of the simplest models of star formation\nfor the stellar nursery that predict\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/\nhow-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">star formation</a>\nbegins in the denser center of a molecular cloud core.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2741\">The result</a>\nrequires a more complex model; perhaps\nstar formation continues longer in the center, or older stars are\nejected from the center due to subcluster mergers.",
