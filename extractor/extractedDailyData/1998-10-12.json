  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nGalaxies this faint have never been seen before. \nIn 1996 the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST)\ncreated one of the most famous pictures of \nmodern astronomy, the \n<a href=\"ap980607.html\">Hubble Deep Field</a> (HDF).  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/niknights.html\">Now HST has returned</a> to a <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/32/content/9832c.jpg\">piece of the HDF</a> for a \nlong exposure by its new \n<a href=\"http://nicmos.as.arizona.edu/\">NICMOS camera</a>, \nsensitive to \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">infrared</a> light.  The resulting image, \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/32/index.html\">shown above</a> in representative color, \nshows known galaxies in a new light, \nand previously unknown galaxies probably farther \nthan anything ever seen before.  Galaxies as dim as \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 30 are visible.  Astronomers are learning from the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/hdf.html\">HDF</a> \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998ApJ...496L..93D&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=34f6e1de7f23290\">how different</a> the young universe was from the \nfamiliar universe of today.",
