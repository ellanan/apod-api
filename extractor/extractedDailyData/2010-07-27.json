  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those strange rock structures?\n\nThey are towers and walls of sedimentary rock that are particularly plentiful in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon\">Bryce Canyon</a> in\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.\n\nThe rock columns may rise higher than 50 meters and are called\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)\">hoodoos</a>.\n\nOn the far left is\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor\">Thor</a>'s Hammer,\nperhaps the most famous\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBmeOzSzKoY\">hoodoo</a>.\n\nThe tall rock columns were carved, most typically, when a unusually dense cap of rock provided a layer of protection to rock underneath from rain-based\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE4j-vScBwo\">erosion</a>.  \n\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.launchphotography.com/Milky_Way_Bryce_panorama.jpg\">above panoramic picture</a> taken earlier this month and compressed horizontally, the foreground rocks were momentarily illuminated by a roving spotlight.\n\nVisible in the background are a few\n<a href=\"ap090203.html\">water clouds</a>\na few kilometers away hovering over the nearby Earth.\n\nVisible well beyond that are thousands of\n<a href=\"ap990113.html\">individually discernible stars</a>\naveraging a few hundred\n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> away in the nearby\n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nFar in the distance lie billions of stars that are thousands of light years away and compose the faintly glowing arch that is the visible\n<a href=\"ap090729.html\">central band</a> of the flat disk of our Milky Way.  \n\nOver many years, wind and rain will eventually cause the tops of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cappadocia_Turkey_2.jpg\">hoodoos</a> to topple, whereafter the\nunderlying column will likely completely erode away.",
