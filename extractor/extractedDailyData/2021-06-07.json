  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat’s that new spot of light in Cassiopeia?\n\nA nova.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/cataclysmic_variables.html\">novas</a> occur frequently throughout the universe, this nova, known as \n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/observing-news/bright-nova-erupts-in-cassiopeia/\">Nova Cas 2021</a> or V1405 Cas, became so unusually bright in the \nskies of Earth last month that it was visible to the \n<a href=\"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/the-human-eye\">unaided eye</a>. \n\nNova Cas 2021 first brightened in mid-March but then, unexpectedly,\nbecame even brighter in mid-May and remained \n<a href=\"https://app.aavso.org/webobs/results/?star=000-BNX-642&amp;num_results=200\">quite bright</a> for about a week. \n\nThe nova then faded back to early-May levels,  \nbut now is slightly brightening again and \n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/LCGv2/\">remains visible</a> through binoculars. \n\nIdentified by the arrow, the nova occurred toward the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)\">constellation of Cassiopeia</a>, \nnot far from the \n<a href=\"ap170531.html\">Bubble Nebula</a>. \n\nA nova is typically caused by a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aHY2a145p0Y\">thermonuclear explosion</a> on the surface of a \n<a href=\"ap150517.html\">white dwarf star</a> that is \n<a href=\"ap200831.html\">accreting matter</a> from a \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/b/binary+star\">binary-star</a> \ncompanion -- although details of this outburst are currently unknown. \n\nNovas don't destroy the underlying star, and are \n<a href=\"ap150111.html\">sometimes seen to recur</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPnkyX8p8sX/\">featured image</a> \nwas created from 14 hours of imaging from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/k-dc-VQQwIA\">Detroit</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan\">Michigan</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>. \n\nBoth professional and amateur astronomers will likely continue to monitor \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.com/news/observing/2021/03/observe-theres-a-new-nova-visible-in-cassiopeia\">Nova Cas 2021</a> and \n<a href=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/04/08/24/cat-4451003_960_720.jpg\">hypothesize</a> about details of its cause.",
