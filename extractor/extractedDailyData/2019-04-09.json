  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes Saturn disappears.\n\nIt doesn't really go away, though, it just disappears from view when our \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AtMXEviIa0\">Moon moves in front</a>. \n\nSuch a Saturnian eclipse was visible along a \n<a href=\"http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/planets/saturn.jpg\">small swath of Earth</a> -- from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil\">Brazil</a> to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka\">Sri Lanka</a> -- \nnear the end of last month.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/schmitzcory/33629445928/in/dateposted-public/\">featured color image</a> is a digital fusion of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_imaging\">clearest images</a> captured by successive videos of \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/141898/see-the-moon-photobomb-saturn-in-an-amazing-capture/\">the event</a> \ntaken in red, green, and blue, and taken separately for \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap151112.html\">comparative bright Moon</a>. \n\nThe exposures were taken from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa\">South Africa</a> just before occultation -- and also just before sunrise.\n\nWhen <a href=\"ap010908.html\">Saturn re-appeared</a> on the other \n<a href=\"ap130716.html\">side of the Moon</a> almost two hours later, the \n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HHqQrph.jpg\">Sun had risen</a>.\n\nThis year, \n<a href=\"ap020222.html \">eclipses</a> of Saturn by \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">the Moon</a> occur \n<a href=\"http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/planets/saturn.jpg\">almost monthly</a>, but, unfortunately, \nare visible only to those with the right location \nand with clear and dark skies.",
