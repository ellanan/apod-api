  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGalactic or\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/open.html\">open star clusters</a>\nare young.\n\nThese swarms of stars are born together near the plane of the Milky Way,\nbut their numbers steadily dwindle as cluster members are\nejected by galactic tides and gravitational interactions.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m046.html\">this\nbright open cluster, known as M46</a>, is around 300 million years\nyoung.\n\nIt still contains a few hundred stars within a span of\n30 light-years or so.\n\nLocated about 5,000 light-years away toward the\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/pup/index.html\">constellation\nPuppis</a>, M46\nalso seems to contain contradictions to its youthful status.\n\nIn this pretty starscape,\nthe colorful, circular patch above and right of the center of M46\nis the planetary nebula NGC 2438.\n\nFainter still, a second planetary nebula, PK231+4.1,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0857\">is identified</a>\nby the box at the right and enlarged in the inset.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are a brief, final phase in the life of a sun-like\nstar a <a href=\"http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp\">billion</a>\nyears old or more,\nwhose central reservoir of hydrogen fuel has been exhausted.\n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2438.html\">NGC 2438</a>\nis estimated to be only 3,000 light-years distant, though, and\nmoves at a different speed than M46 cluster members.\n\nAlong with its fainter cohort, planetary nebula NGC 2438 is likely\n<a href=\"ap090122.html\">only by chance</a>\nappearing near our line-of-sight to the young stars of M46.",
