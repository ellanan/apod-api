  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nArcing toward a fiery fate, this Sungrazer comet\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/LASCO/las013.cap\">was recorded by</a> the SOHO spacecraft's\n<a href=\"http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/aaas/aaas_press_release.html\">Large Angle Spectrometric COronagraph</a>\n(LASCO) on Dec. 23rd, 1996.\n\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/LASCO/index.html\">LASCO</a> uses an occulting disk, partially visible at the lower right,\nto block out the otherwise overwhelming\n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">solar disk</a> allowing it to\nimage the inner 5 million miles of the relatively faint\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/english/\nwind_and_corona.html\">corona</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/index.html\">The comet is seen</a> as its\n<a href=\"ap961219.html\">coma</a> enters the bright equatorial\n<a href=\"ap970217.html\">solar wind region</a>\n(oriented vertically).  Spots and blemishes on the image\nare background stars and camera streaks caused by charged particles.\n\nPositioned in space to\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/english/page1.html\">continuously observe the Sun, SOHO</a>\nhas detected 7 sungrazing comets.  Based on their orbits, they are\nbelieved to belong to a family of comets created by successive\n<a href=\"ap950713.html\">break ups from a single large parent comet</a>\nwhich passed very near the sun in the twelfth century.\n\n<a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/ikeya-seki.html\">The bright comet of 1965, Ikeya-Seki,</a> was also a member of the Sungrazer\nfamily, coming within about 400,000 miles of the Sun's surface.\n\n<a href=\"ap960727.html\">Passing so close to the Sun</a>, Sungrazers are subjected to\ndestructive tidal forces along with intense solar heat.\n\nThis comet, known as SOHO 6, did not survive.",
