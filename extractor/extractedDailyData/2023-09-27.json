  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNot every road ends in a STEVE.\n\nA week ago, a sky enthusiast's journey began with a goal: \nto photograph an \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/\">aurora</a> over \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iM73QjPiiwU\">Lake Huron</a>.\n\nDriving through rural \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario\">Ontario</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>, \nthe forecasted sky show started \n<a href=\"https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=18&amp;month=09&amp;year=2023\">unexpectedly early</a>, \ncausing the photographer to stop before arriving at the scenic \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes\">Great Lake</a>.\n\nAurora images were taken toward the north -- but over land, not sea.\n\nWhile waiting for a second round of auroras, a \n<a href=\"ap210505.html\">peculiar band</a> of light was noticed to the west. \n\nSlowly, the photographer and friends realized \nthat this western band was likely an unusual type of aurora: a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEVE\">Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement</a> (STEVE).\n\nMoreover, this \n<a href=\"ap201117.html\">STEVE</a> was putting on quite a show: \nappearing intertwined with the central band of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> while intersecting the horizon just \nnear the end of the country road.\n\nAfter capturing \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxZdU7rsPiW/\">this cosmic X</a> \non camera, the photographer paused to appreciate the \n<a href=\"https://medicaregranny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5cfa3122210000690de6bfca.jpeg\">unexpected awesomeness</a> of finding \nextraordinary beauty in an ordinary setting.",
