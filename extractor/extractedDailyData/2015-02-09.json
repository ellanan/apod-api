  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat caused these Martian rocks to be layered?\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4398\">leading hypothesis</a> is an \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS99yR1cooE\">ancient Martian lake</a> that kept evaporating and refilling over 10 million years -- but has now remained dry and empty of water for billions of years. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19076\">featured image</a>, \ntaken last November by the \n<a href=\"ap140627.html\">robotic Curiosity rover</a>, \nshows one-meter wide Whale Rock which is part of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/mro/pia19114/\">Pahrump Hills</a> outcrop at the base of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aeolis_Mons\">Mount Sharp</a>.\n\nAlso evident in the image is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-bedding\">cross-bedding</a> -- rock with angled layers -- which were likely facilitated by \n<a href=\"ap120422.html\">waves of sand</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/\">Curiosity</a> continues to find many layered \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19081\">rocks like this</a> as it continues to roll around and up 5.5-km high \n<a href=\"ap120827.html\">Mount Sharp</a>.",
