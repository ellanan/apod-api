  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the Moon is a busy direction.\n\nLast week, for example, our very \n<a href=\"ap120720.html\">Moon passed</a> in front of the planet Jupiter.\n\nWhile capturing this unusual spectacle from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales\">New South Wales</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, \na quick-thinking astrophotographer realized that a nearby plane \nmight itself pass in front of the Moon, \nand so quickly reset his camera to take a continuous series of short duration shots.\n\nAs hoped, for a brief instant, that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_me_to_the_moon\">airplane, the Moon</a>, \nand Jupiter were all visible in a single exposure, which is \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=30639&amp;start=100#p193302\">shown above</a>.\n\nBut the project was not complete -- a longer exposure was then taken to bring up three of the Jupiter's own moons: \n<a href=\"ap001118.html\">Io, Callisto, and Europa</a> (from left to right).\n\nUnfortunately, this <a href=\"ap970723.html\">triple spectacle</a> soon disappeared.\n\nLess than a second later, the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCW9Hey6IVY\">plane flew away from the Moon</a>.\n\nA few seconds after that, \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18020\">the Moon</a> moved to cover all of Jupiter.\n\nA few minutes after that, \n<a href=\"ap980513.html\">Jupiter reappeared</a> on the other side of the Moon, \nand even a few minutes after that the Moon moved completely away from Jupiter.\n\nAlthough <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhtT_NPwwlc\">hard to catch</a>, \nplanes cross in front of the Moon \n<a href=\"ap070605.html\">quite frequently</a>, but the \n<a href=\"http://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/cgi-bin/koyomi/occulx_p_en.cgi\">Moon won't eclipse</a> Jupiter again for another three years.",
