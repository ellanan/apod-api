  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening at the center of our galaxy?\n\nIt's hard to tell with optical telescopes since \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible light</a> is blocked by intervening interstellar dust.\n\nIn other bands of light, though, such as \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap180729.html\">galactic center</a> \ncan be imaged and shows itself to be quite an \n<a href=\"https://www.sarao.ac.za/media-releases/new-meerkat-radio-image-reveals-complex-heart-of-the-milky-way/\">interesting and active place</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/astro_jcm/51847931721/\">featured picture</a> shows the latest image of our Milky Way's center by the \n<a href=\"https://www.sarao.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/\">MeerKAT array</a> \nof 64 radio dishes in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa\">South Africa</a>.\n\nSpanning four times the angular size of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> \n(2 <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/degrees.html\">degrees</a>), \nthe image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed. \n\n<a href=\"ap020803.html\">Many known sources</a> \nare shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, \nsince the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXAU0gzsPOw\">galactic center</a> \nis in the direction of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)\">constellation Sagittarius</a>. \n\nIn our Galaxy's Center lies \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A\">Sgr A</a>, \nfound here in the image center, which houses the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. \n\nOther sources in the image are not as well understood, including \n<a href=\"ap020521.html\">the Arc</a>, just to the left of \n<a href=\"ap180122.html\">Sgr A</a>, and numerous filamentary threads.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.sarao.ac.za/large-survey-projects/\">Goals for MeerKAT</a> include searching for radio emission \nfrom neutral hydrogen emitted in a much younger universe and brief but distant \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/F/Fast+Radio+Bursts\">radio flashes</a>.",
