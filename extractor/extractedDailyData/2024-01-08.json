  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nVenus goes through \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus\">phases</a>. \n\nJust like our Moon, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/venus/\">Venus</a> \ncan appear as a full circular disk, a thin \n<a href=\"ap230826.html\">crescent</a>, or anything in between. \n\nVenus, frequently the brightest object in the \n<a href=\"ap230102.html\">post-sunset</a> or \n<a href=\"ap160130.html\">pre-sunrise</a> sky, appears so small, \nhowever, that it usually requires binoculars or a small telescope to clearly see its current phase. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/images/detail/ann23043a/\">featured time-lapse sequence</a> was taken over the course of six months in 2015 from Surgères, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/nAlTvNII1O8\">Charente-Maritime</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>, \nand shows not only how Venus changes phase, but changes angular size as well.\n\nWhen \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=Venus\">Venus</a> is on the far side of the Sun from the Earth, \nit appears angularly smallest and nearest to full phase, while when \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/five-petals-of-venus/\">Venus and Earth</a> are on the same side of the Sun, \n<a href=\"https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/adorable-striped-cat-looking-up-cat-portrait-close-up_199743-10939.jpg\">Venus appears</a> larger, but as a crescent.\n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/upl/2023/01/Venus-elongation-north-sunrise-2023-Guy-Ottewell.jpg\">This month Venus</a> rises before dawn in \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/\">waxing</a> \n<a href=\"ap231112.html\">gibbous</a> \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/\">phases</a>.",
