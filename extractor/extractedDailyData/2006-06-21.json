  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday the Sun reaches its northernmost point in the planet Earth's sky.  \n\nCalled a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice\">solstice</a>, \nthe date traditionally marks a change of seasons -- from spring to summer in \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">Earth</a>'s Northern Hemisphere and from fall to \nwinter in Earth's <a href=\"ap021222.html\">Southern Hemisphere</a>.   \n\nPictured above is the 2005 Summer Solstice celebration at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge\">Stonehenge</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uk.html\">England</a>.  \n\nThe event was rare because \n<a href=\"ap990912.html\">Stonehenge</a> was not always open to the public, \nand because recent summer solstices there had been annoyingly cloudy.  \n\nIn 2005, however, thousands of people gathered at sunrise to see the sun rise \nthrough the \n<a href=\"ap020509.html\">4,000 year old solar monument</a>.  \n\nEven given the <a href=\"http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=54\">precession of the Earth's rotational axis</a> \nover the millennia, the Sun continues to rise over \n<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.876\">Stonehenge</a> in an \n<a href=\"ap040528.html\">astronomically significant way</a>. \n\nIn fact, the photographer was able to find a good spot where the \n<a href=\"ap040320.html\">rising Sun</a> \nappeared over one of Stonehenge's massive standing stones.",
