  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf our Sun were part of this star cluster, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightfall_(Asimov_short_story_and_novel)\">night sky</a> would glow like a jewel box of bright stars.\n\nThis cluster, known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_53\">M53</a> and cataloged as NGC 5024, is one of about 250\n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular clusters</a> that survive in our Galaxy.\n\nMost of the stars in\n<a href=\"http://gclusters.altervista.org/cluster_4.php?ggc=M+53\">M53</a> \nare older and redder than our Sun, but some enigmatic stars appear to be bluer and younger.\n\nThese young\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18009\">stars</a> might contradict the hypothesis that all the stars in\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-53\">M53</a> \nformed at nearly the same time.\n\nThese unusual stars are known as\n<a href=\"http://www.solstation.com/x-objects/bluestrag.htm\">blue stragglers</a> and are unusually common in M53.\n\nAfter much debate, \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/b/blue+stragglers\">blue stragglers</a> are now thought to be stars rejuvenated by \nfresh matter falling in from a binary star companion.\n\nBy <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....118..453C/abstract\">analyzing</a> pictures of globular clusters like the\n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/potw1140a/\">featured image</a> taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_straggler\">use the abundance</a> of stars like\n<a href=\"ap971104.html\">blue stragglers</a> to help\ndetermine the age of the globular cluster and hence a <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question28.html\">limit on the age</a> of the universe.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.messier-objects.com/messier-53/\">M53, visible</a> \nwith a binoculars towards the\n<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/comaberenices.htm\">constellation of Bernice's Hair</a> (Coma Berenices), \ncontains over 250,000 stars and is one of the furthest \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_clusters\">globulars</a> from the center of our Galaxy.",
