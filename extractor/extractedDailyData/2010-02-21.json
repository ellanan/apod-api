  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLike a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly\">butterfly</a>, a <a href=\"ap000910.html\">white dwarf star</a> begins its life\nby casting off a\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTUgUEpqBrA\">cocoon</a> that enclosed its former self.  \n\nIn this analogy, however, the <a href=\"ap060502.html\">Sun</a> would be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar\">caterpillar</a> and the ejected shell of gas would become the prettiest of all!\n\nIn the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1999/35/image/e\">above cocoon</a>, the <a href=\"planetary_nebulae.html\">planetary nebula</a> designated\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/wallpaper/pr2007009a/\">NGC 2440</a>, contains one of the\n<a href=\"ap951130.html\">hottest white dwarf stars known</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/dwarfs.html\">white dwarf</a> can be seen as the bright dot near the photo's center.  \n\n<a href=\"http://soi.stanford.edu/press/sun-interview.html\">Our Sun</a> will eventually become a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf\">white dwarf</a>\nbutterfly but not for another 5 billion years.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/38/\">above false color image</a> was post-processed by <a href=\"\nhttp://heritage.stsci.edu/commonpages/infoindex/ourproject/f_hamilton.html\">Forrest Hamilton</a>.",
