  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLast Friday, the Moon and Venus shared the early\nevening sky in a beautiful conjunction.\n\nSeparated by only\nabout 2 degrees, they also were both in a crescent\n<a href=\"ap060110.html\">phase</a>.  \n\nJust like our <a href=\"ap051113.html\">Moon</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html\">Venus</a>\ncan appear as a full disk or a\n<a href=\"ap040521.html\">thin crescent</a>.  \n\nFrequently the brightest object in the post-sunset or pre-sunrise sky,\nVenus is so small that it usually requires\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars\">binoculars</a> or a\n<a href=\"ap011014.html\">small telescope</a> to clearly see its phase.  \n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.ancientstarlight.com/Moon_Venus.html\">telescopic\nimage</a> of Friday's conjunction shows off the\n<a href=\"ap060618.html\">similar crescent phases</a>, with the tiny\ncrescent Venus at the upper right.",
