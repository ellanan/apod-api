  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but have you ever seen a sunrise like this? \n\nHere, after initial cloudiness, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> \nappeared to rise in two pieces and during partial eclipse, \ncausing the photographer to describe it as the most stunning sunrise of his life. \n\nThe dark circle near the top of the \n<a href=\"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/about/redsky/\">atmospherically-reddened Sun</a> is \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">the Moon</a> -- but so is the dark peak just below it. \n\nThis is because along the way, the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/463940main_atmosphere-layers2_full.jpg\">Earth's atmosphere</a> had a \nlayer of unusually warm air over the sea which acted like a \n<a href=\"ap180101.html\">gigantic lens</a> and created a \n<a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6469/files/twincats.png\">second image</a>. \n\nFor a normal sunrise or sunset, this rare phenomenon of \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/\">atmospheric optics</a> \nis known as the <a href=\"ap090223.html\">Etruscan vase effect</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218267837101477&amp;set=pcb.10218267840661566&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">featured picture</a> was captured two mornings ago from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wakrah\">Al Wakrah</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar\">Qatar</a>. \n\nSome observers in a narrow band of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/\">Earth</a> \nto the east were able to see a \n<a href=\"ap120519.html\">full annular solar eclipse</a> -- \nwhere the Moon appears completely surrounded by the background Sun in a \n<a href=\"ap090125.html\">ring of fire</a>. \n\nThe next solar eclipse, also an annular eclipse, will occur in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_June_21,_2020\">2020 June</a>.",
