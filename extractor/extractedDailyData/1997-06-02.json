  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:  \nThis galaxy is having a bad millennium.  In fact, the past 100 million \nyears haven't been so good, and probably the next billion or so should \nbe quite tumultuous.  \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?bibcode=1995AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E109%2E%2E960W&amp;page=1&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;type=GIF&amp;nosetcookie=1\">NGC \n4039</a> was a normal \n<a href=\"ap970419.html\">spiral galaxy</a>, minding its own business, when \n<a href=\"ap970506.html\">NGC 4038</a> crashed into it.  \nThe evolving wreckage, known as the \n\"<a href=\"http://galileo.ifa.hawaii.edu/~hibbard/n4038/n4038.html\">Antennae</a>\", \nis pictured above.  As \n<a href=\"http://loner.ccsr.uiuc.edu/cyberprof/physics/101/Lecture/L13P3.html\">gravity</a> \npulls each galaxy apart, clouds of gas slam into each other and \nbright blue knots are formed.  These knots are large clusters of stars imbedded in \nvast regions of \n<a href=\"http://www.phys.unm.edu/~duric/l2h/l6/node1.html\">ionized \nhydrogen gas</a>. The high abundance of relatively dim star clusters is quite unlike our \n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/globs.html\">Milky Way's globular cluster system</a>, \nthough.   Perhaps some of these \n<a href=\"ap970214.html\">young star cluster</a>s will go on to form \n<a href=\"ap961004.html\">globular clusters</a>, while others \nwill disperse through close gravitational encounters.\nThe <a href=\"http://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/hst_proposal_search?proposal_id=304&amp;action=search&amp;show=data+abs\">above \npicture</a> is centered around the larger of the \ntwo interacting galaxies: NGC 4038.  \nThe diagonal streak across the upper left is unrelated to the\ncolliding galaxies.  The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/LookLike/\">color contrast</a>\n in the above three-color mosaic was chosen to highlight extended features.",
