  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could fly over \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/\">Pluto</a>'s moon Charon -- what might you see?\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft did just this in 2015 July as it \n<a href=\"ap250518.html\">zipped past Pluto</a> and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/moons/charon/\">Charon</a> with cameras blazing. \n\nThe images recorded allowed for a digital reconstruction of much of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(moon)\">Charon</a>'s surface, \nfurther enabling the creation of fictitious flights over Charon created from this data. \n\nOne such fanciful, minute-long, time-lapse video is \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/flyover-pluto-moon-charon/\">shown here</a> with vertical heights and colors of \nsurface features digitally enhanced. \n\nYour journey begins over a wide chasm that divides different types of \n<a href=\"ap151002.html\">Charon's landscape</a>s, \na chasm that might have formed when \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/pluto-s-big-moon-charon-reveals-a-colorful-and-violent-history\">Charon</a> froze through.\n\nYou soon turn \n<a href=\"ap200407.html\">north</a> and fly over a colorful depression dubbed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor_Macula\">Mordor</a> that, \none hypothesis holds, is an \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/science/pluto-moon-charon.html\">unusual remnant</a> from an ancient impact. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/964jz1/dog_surfing_on_a_wave_on_ocean_sea_on_summer/#lightbox\">Your voyage</a> continues over an \n<a href=\"ap140826.html\">alien landscape</a> \nrich with never-before-seen craters, mountains, and \n<a href=\"ap201129.html\">crevice</a>s. \n\nThe robotic <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image/ames/take-new-horizons-for-a-spin-and-print-your-own-model\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> has too much \n<a href=\"http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Collision-Carts/Collision-Carts-Interactive\">momentum</a> to ever return to \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/facts/\">Pluto</a> \nand Charon and is now \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/new-horizons/nasas-new-horizons-to-continue-exploring-outer-solar-system/\">headed out</a> of our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>.",
