  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe GRB distance scale controversy\n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/~george/grb.html\">may have just ended with a flash</a>.\n<a href=\"ap961123.html\">Gamma Ray Bursts</a> (GRBs) \nare powerful explosions occurring in seemingly random positions on the sky.  \n<a href=\"ap970407.html\">They are so featureless and so poorly resolved</a>,\nhowever, that their distances could not be determined. \n\nLast Thursday, May 8th, the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Beppo-Sax Satellite</a> \ndetected and precisely located a GRB (GRB970508),\nquickly relaying its position to astronomers.\nWithin hours, many of the \n<a href=\"ap960715.html\">world's most powerful telescopes</a> \nwere re-pointed in the direction of the new GRB.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uva.nl/paulgr/grb970508.html\">There they found a faint but variable optical source</a>:\na potential counterpart to the gamma-ray burst that was getting brighter.  \nMost importantly, continued scrutiny showed that this \n<a href=\"ap970422.html\">optical transient</a>\nhad absorption lines with a \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/glossary.html#redshift\">redshift</a> of about 0.8 - the distance scale of \n<a href=\"ap970209.html\">galaxies</a> and \n<a href=\"ap961125.html\">quasars</a>.\nIf this source and GRB970508 are related, the GRB itself must be \nmany billions of light-years away and the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">30-year controversy</a> on the distance scale to GRBs will draw \ndramatically to a close.  GRBs could move from the realm of \nastronomical mystery to useful beacons of the early universe.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uva.nl/paulgr/grb970508.html\">Above is a \"negative\" image of the GRB970508 field</a>,\nlocated near the north celestial pole,\ntaken hours after the initial flash of gamma rays.\n\nThe faint optical transient source is inside the box.\nNorth is up and the image is 2.5 arcminutes across (about a tenth the size\nof the full moon).",
