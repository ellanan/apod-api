  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhile chasing the <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/\nlight/absorption.html\">spectrum</a> of a mysterious arc in a cluster of\ngalaxies within the obscure northerly\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/lyn/\">constellation\nLynx</a>, astronomers have\nstumbled upon the most massive and distant star-forming region\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/32/\ntext\">ever discovered</a>.\n\nThe notably red \"Lynx arc\" lies right of center in\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/32/image/b\">this\ncolor image</a> of the galaxy cluster, a composite of\nHubble Space Telescope and ground-based data.\n\nWhile the galaxy cluster lies about 5 billion\nlight-years distant,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307162\">spectroscopic studies</a>\nshow that the arc itself is actually a distorted\nimage of an even more distant but enormous star-forming region.\n\nThe image is formed as the closer galaxy cluster's\n<a href=\"http://whyfiles.org/052einstein/grav_lens.html\">gravity\nbends light</a>\nlike a magnifying lens, an effect explained by Einstein's\ntheory of gravity.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/32/\nfastfacts\">In fact</a>, the monster star-forming region is nearly\n12 billion\n<a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part8/\nsection-14.html\">light-years away</a>\nand about a million times brighter than the\nmore familiar stellar nursery, the\n<a href=\"ap030225.html\">Orion Nebula</a>.\n\nEstimates are that the star-forming region seen as the\nLynx arc contains about a million massive, hot stars, compared\nto the four stars which power the\nOrion Nebula's glow. \n\nStars within the Lynx arc are more than twice as hot\nas the Orion Nebula's <a href=\"ap030302.html\">central stars</a>\nand were formed when\nthe Universe was a mere 2 billion years old.\n\nStill, astronomers believe that the\n<a href=\"ap030610.html\">first stars</a> were\nformed at even earlier times.",
