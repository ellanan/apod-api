  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAs planned, the Cassini spacecraft impacted the\nupper atmosphere of Saturn on September 15,\nafter a 13 year long exploration of\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/the-saturn-system.html\">the\nSaturnian System</a>.\n\nWith spacecraft thrusters firing until the end, its\natmospheric entry followed an unprecedented series of 22\nGrand Finale dives between Saturn and rings.\n\n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/\ncassini-end-of-mission-timeline/\">Cassini's final signal</a>\ntook 83 minutes to reach\nplanet Earth and the Deep Space Network antenna complex\nin Canberra Australia where\nloss of contact with the spacecraft was recorded at 11:55 UT.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/\ncassini-spacecraft-makes-its-final-approach-to-saturn\">For the spacecraft</a>,\nSaturn was bright and the Sun was overhead as it\nplowed into the gas giant planet's swirling cloud tops at about\n70,000 miles (113,000 kilometers) per hour.\n\nBut <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21895/\ncassinis-final-image\">Cassini's final image</a> shows\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21896/\nimpact-site-infrared\">the impact site</a>\nhours earlier and still on the planet's night side,\nthe cloud tops illuminated by ringlight, sunlight\nreflected from Saturn's rings.",
