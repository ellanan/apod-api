  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDo you see the horse's head?   \n\nWhat you are seeing is not the famous \n<a href=\"ap051130.html\">Horsehead nebula</a> toward Orion but \nrather a fainter nebula that only takes on a familiar form with deeper imaging.  \n\nThe main part of the \n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/IC4592JM.html\">above imaged</a> \n<a href=\"ap060409.html\">molecular cloud</a> complex is a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula\">reflection nebula</a> \ncataloged as \n<a href=\"http://aisig.sdaa.org/astroblogDetail.asp?imgID=1035&amp;UserID=66\">IC 4592</a>.  \n\nReflection nebulas are actually made up of very fine \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> that normally appears dark but can \nlook quite blue when reflecting the light of energetic nearby stars.  \n\nIn this case, the source of much of the reflected light is a star at the eye of the horse.  \n\nThat star is part of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii\">Nu Scorpii</a>, \none of the brighter star systems toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/sco-t.html\">constellation of Scorpius</a>.    \n\nA second\n<a href=\"reflection_nebulae.html\"> reflection nebula</a> \ndubbed IC 4601 is visible surrounding two stars on the far right.",
