  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning.\n\nMore precisely, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/\">energetic light</a> and \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">wind</a>s \nfrom massive newly formed \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">stars</a> are evaporating and dispersing the \n<a href=\"ap220314.html\">dusty stellar nurseries</a> in which they formed.\n\nLocated in the \n<a href=\"ap190623.html\">Carina Nebula</a> and inside a region \nknown informally as \n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/heic1007a/\">Mystic Mountain</a>, \nthese pillars' appearance is dominated by opaque brown dust \neven though it is composed mostly of clear \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/rjn/apod/lib/lament.html\">hydrogen</a> gas.\n\nEven though some of the \n<a href=\"ap211214.html\">dust pillar</a>s look like \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch\">torches</a>, \ntheir ends are not on \n<a href=\"ap180826.html\">fire</a> -- rather, they are illuminated by nearby stars. \n\nAbout 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and highlights \nan interior region of Carina known as \n<a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/HST-WFC3-Imaging-of-Protostellar-Jets-in-Carina%3A-Reiter-Smith/71a6e0755f3b9ec46ca909c34ff0d3b282c6be00/figure/6\">HH1066</a> \nwhich spans nearly a  \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light year</a>.\n\nWithin a few million years, the stars will likely \n<a href=\"https://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/images/2013/01/Cats-Standing/30-Cats-Standing.jpg\">win out</a> completely and the dust torches will completely \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/avgUGHv2Sl4\">evaporate</a>.",
