  "title": "Milky Way and Planets Near Opposition",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn this early May night skyscape,\n<a href=\"ap080905.html\">a mountain road</a> near Bursa, Turkey\nseems to lead toward bright planets Mars and Saturn\nand the center of our Milky Way Galaxy, a direction\nnearly opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky.\n\nThe brightest celestial beacon on the scene,\n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/opposition/\">Mars,\nreaches its opposition tonight</a> and Saturn in early June.\n\nBoth will remain\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/159630914\">nearly opposite the Sun</a>,\nup all night and close\nto Earth for the coming weeks, so the time is right for\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/\nobserving-news/mars-opposition-best-showing-in-a-decade/\">good\ntelescopic viewing</a>.\n\nMars and Saturn form the tight\n<a href=\"ap160325.html\">celestial triangle</a> with\nred giant star Antares just right of the Milky Way's central bulge.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/?p=160933\">But tonight the Moon</a>\nis also at opposition.\n\nEasy to see near bright Mars and Saturn,\nthe Full Moon's light will wash out the central Milky Way's\nfainter starlight though, even in dark mountain skies.",
