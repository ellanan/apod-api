  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOrbiting 1,075 miles above the Earth, a 250 foot wide, inflated,\nreinforced nylon \"wheel\"\n<a href=\"http://station.nasa.gov/reference/history/visions/index.html\">was conceived</a> in the early 1950s to function\nas a navigational aid, meteorological station, military platform, and\nway station for space exploration by rocket pioneer\n<a href=\"http://trs.msfc.nasa.gov/history/vbg/\">Wernher von Braun</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/history/mm/sect005.html\">The wheel-shaped station</a> could be easily rotated creating artificial\ngravity so that the astronauts would not suffer the effects of\nprolonged weightlessness.\n\nVon Braun and his team favored building a\n<a href=\"http://shuttle-mir.nasa.gov/shuttle-mir/\">permanently occupied</a>\n<a href=\"http://station.nasa.gov/core.html\">Earth orbiting space station</a> from which to stage a lunar exploration\nprogram.\n\nBut in the 1960s NASA adopted\n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/cover.html\">the Apollo Program</a>, which called for\nastronauts to transfer to a landing vehicle after achieving lunar\norbit, bypassing the construction of von Braun's wheel.",
