  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis tantalizing trio of galaxies sometimes called the Draco Group,\nis located in the northern constellation of (you guessed it)\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dra/index.html\">Draco, the Dragon</a>.\n\nFrom left to right are\n<a href=\"ap040410.html\">face-on</a> spiral NGC 5985,\n<a href=\"ap060520.html\">elliptical</a> galaxy NGC 5982, and\n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">edge-on</a> spiral NGC 5981,\nall found within this\nsingle telescopic field of view that spans a little more than\nthe width of the full moon.\n\nWhile the group is far too small to be a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/gal_clus.html\">galaxy cluster</a>,\nand has not been\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/hickson/hcg/\">catalogued</a>\nas a compact galaxy group,\nthe three galaxies all do lie roughly\n100 million light-years from planet Earth.\n\nNot as well known as other tight\n<a href=\"ap220718.html\">groupings of galaxies</a>,\nthe contrast in visual appearance\nstill makes this triplet an attractive subject for astroimagers.\n\nOn close examination with\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/how_l1/spectral.html\">spectrographs</a>,\nthe bright core of striking spiral NGC 5985 shows\nprominent emission in specific wavelengths of light, prompting\nastronomers to classify it as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/ScholarX/seyferts.html\">Seyfert</a>, a type of active galaxy.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/os11uz/D/\">impressively deep exposure</a>\nhints at a faint dim halo along with sharp-edged shells surrounding\nelliptical NGC 5982, evidence of past galactic mergers.\n\nIt also reveals many even more\n<a href=\"https://universe.nasa.gov/galaxies/basics/\">distant background galaxies</a>.",
