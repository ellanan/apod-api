  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/similar/halley_pt.html\">In 1716</a>,\nEnglish astronomer\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/halley_edmond.shtml\">Edmond Halley</a>\nnoted, \"This is but a little Patch, but it shews itself to the\nnaked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m013.html\">Of course, M13</a>\nis now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in\nHercules, one of the brightest\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\">globular\nstar clusters</a> in the northern sky.\n\nSharp telescopic views like this one\nreveal the spectacular cluster's\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/gobs-of-globs-guide-to-16-spring-globular-clusters/\">hundreds of thousands of stars.</a>\n\nAt a distance of 25,000 light-years, the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2008/news-2008-40.html\">cluster stars crowd</a>\ninto a region 150 light-years in diameter.\n\n<a href=\"ap031213.html\">Approaching</a> the cluster core, \nupwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side.\n\nFor comparison with our neighborhood of the Milky Way, the\n<a href=\"ap160825.html\">closest star</a> to the Sun is over\n4 light-years away.\n\nEarly telescopic observers of the great globular cluster also\nnoted a curious convergence of three dark lanes with a spacing\nof about 120 degrees, seen here just below the cluster center. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_ngc6205.html\">Known as the propeller in M13</a>, the shape is likely a\n<a href=\"ap231120.html\">chance</a> optical effect of the\ndistribution of stars viewed from our perspective\nagainst the dense cluster core.",
