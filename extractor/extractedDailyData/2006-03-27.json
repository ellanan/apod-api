  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are there so many moonquakes?   \n \nA recent reanalysis of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer\">seismometers</a> \nleft on the moon by the \n<a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/introduction.htm\">Apollo moon landings</a> has revealed a surprising number of moonquakes occurring within 30 kilometers of the surface.  \n \nIn fact, 28 \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005AGUFM.P51A0915N\">moonquakes</a> were detected in data recorded between 1972 and 1977.  \n \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/15mar_moonquakes.htm\">These moonquakes</a> were not only strong enough to move \n<a href=\"http://www.maltwood.uvic.ca/hoft/timeline.html\">furniture</a> but the stiff rock of the moon continued \nvibrating for many minutes, significantly longer than the soft rock \n<a href=\"http://www.crustal.ucsb.edu/ics/outreach/understanding/elastic/intro-rebound.html\">earthquakes</a> on <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a>.  \n \nThe cause of the moonquakes remains unknown, \nwith one hypothesis holding that \n<a href=\"http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/glossary.php?termID=105&amp;alpha=L\">landslides</a> in craters cause the vibrations.  \n \nRegardless of the source, <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/vision/lunar/ndxpage1.html\">future moon buildings</a> \nneed to be built to withstand the frequent shakings.  \n \n<a href=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001102.html\">Pictured above</a> in 1969, Apollo 11 astronaut \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin\">Buzz Aldrin</a> stands besides a recently deployed <a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo15/A15_Experiments_PSE.html\">lunar seismometer</a>, looking back toward the \n<a href=\"ap030920.html\">lunar landing module</a>.",
