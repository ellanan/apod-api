  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could stand at the top of a volcano and peer out across the universe?\n\nIf the timing is right, you might see an amazing panorama like the one \n<a href=\"http://www.shaneblackphoto.com/Portfolio/i-gJgPg3c\">featured here</a>.\n\nIn this case, the volcano is the Hawaii's \n<a href=\"ap130310.html\">Mauna</a> \n<a href=\"ap050704.html\">Kea</a>, and the time was a clear night last summer\n\nIn the foreground of this south-facing panorama lies a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgNSOFU85Vk\">rugged landscape</a> dotted with rocks and \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/natural-history/flora.html\">hardy plants</a>.\n\nSlightly above and further out, a \n<a href=\"http://74211.com/wallpaper/picture_thumb/Image-of-Sleeping-Cat-Sleeping-Under-White-Blanket-Sound-and-Long-Sleep.jpg\">white blanket</a> of clouds spreads horizontally to the horizon, seemingly dividing heaven and Earth.  \n\nCity lights illuminate the clouds and sky on the far left, while orange lava in the volcanic caldera of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%ABlauea\">Kilauea</a> lights up the clouds just left of center. \n\nThe summit of an even more distant Hawaiian volcano, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa\">Mauna Loa</a>, is visible in dark silhouette near the central horizon.\n\nGreen <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=79817\">airglow</a> is visible above the clouds, caused by air \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow\">molecules excited</a> by the Sun during the day.  \n\nThe Moon is the bright orb on the right.\n\nA diffuse band of light-colored \n<a href=\"ap140911.html\">zodiacal light</a> extends up from the far right.\n\nMost distant, the dramatic \n<a href=\"ap110710.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nappears to rise vertically from Mauna Loa.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.shaneblackphoto.com/About\">The person</a> who witnessed and captured this breathtaking panorama stands before you in the image center.",
