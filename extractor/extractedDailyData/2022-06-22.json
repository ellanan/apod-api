  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTen thousand years ago, before the dawn of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history\">recorded human history</a>, \na new light would have suddenly have appeared in the \nnight sky and faded after a few weeks.  \n\nToday we know this light was from a\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">supernova,\nor exploding star</a>,\nand record the expanding debris cloud as the \n<a href=\"ap121126.html\">Veil Nebula</a>, a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernova_remnants\">supernova remnant</a>.  \n\nImaged with color filters featuring light emitted by\n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/16.shtml\">sulfur</a> (red), \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> (green), and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a> (blue), \nthis deep wide-angle view was processed to remove the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> and so \nbetter capture the impressive glowing filaments of the Veil. \n\nAlso known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Loop\">Cygnus Loop</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_Nebula\">Veil Nebula</a> \nis roughly circular in shape and covers nearly \n3 degrees on the sky toward the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)\">constellation of the Swan</a> (Cygnus).\n\n<a href=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/98880a65948559.5b05916bdc9e3.jpg\">Famous</a> nebular <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_Nebula#/media/File:Cygnus_Loop_Labeled.png\">sections include</a> the \n<a href=\"ap211027.html\">Bat Nebula</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap180408.html\">Witch's Broom Nebula</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap210727.html\">Fleming's Triangular Wisp</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rsqZlXREz2E\">complete supernova remnant</a> lies about 1,400\n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/\nquestion19.html\">light-years</a> away.",
