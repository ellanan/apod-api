  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat lies at the edge of an expanding supernova? \n\nSubtle and delicate in appearance, these \nribbons of shocked interstellar gas are part of \na blast wave at the expanding edge of a violent \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aysiMbgml5g\">stellar explosion</a> \nthat would have been easily visible to humans during the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_prehistory#Upper_Paleolithic\">late stone age</a>, about 20,000 years ago.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw2034a/\">featured image</a> was recorded by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and is a closeup of the outer edge of \na supernova remnant known as the Cygnus Loop or \n<a href=\"ap191031.html\">Veil Nebula</a>. \n\nThe filamentary shock front is \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/4kxgvn/\">moving toward</a> \nthe top of the frame at about 170 kilometers per second, \nwhile glowing in light emitted by atoms of excited \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> gas. \n\nThe distances to stars thought to be interacting with the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Loop\">Cygnus Loop</a> \nhave recently been found by the Gaia mission to be about 2400 light years distant. \n\nThe whole <a href=\"ap200826.html\">Cygnus Loop</a> spans six \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">full Moon</a>s across the sky, corresponding to about 130 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a>, \nand parts can be seen with a small telescope toward the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)\">constellation</a> \nof the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan#/media/File:Cygnus_olor_2_(Marek_Szczepanek).jpg\">Swan</a> (Cygnus).",
