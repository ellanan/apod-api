  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWould you go to the end of the world to see a total eclipse of the Sun?\n\nIf you did, would you be surprised to find someone else \n<a href=\"http://www.icstars.com/Antarctica/Eclipse2003.html\">there already?</a>\n\nIn 2003, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>, \nthe Moon, Antarctica, and two photographers all lined up in\n<a href=\"ap991116.html\">Antarctica</a> during an unusual\n<a href=\"ap100730.html\">total solar eclipse</a>.  \n\nEven given the extreme location, a group of\n<a href=\"http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html\">enthusiastic eclipse chasers</a> ventured near the\nbottom of the world to\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUNau9YjA2U\">experience the surreal</a> momentary\ndisappearance of the <a href=\"ap240303.html\">Sun behind the Moon</a>.  \n\nOne of the treasures collected was the\n<a href=\"http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html\">featured picture</a> -- a composite of four separate images\ndigitally combined to realistically simulate how the adaptive human\n<a href=\"ap230516.html\">eye saw</a> the eclipse.  \n\nAs the image was taken, both the\n<a href=\"ap031127.html\">Moon and the Sun</a>\npeeked together over an Antarctic ridge.  \n\nIn the\n<a href=\"ap211205.html\">sudden darkness</a>, the\n<a href=\"ap100316.html\">magnificent corona</a>\nof the Sun became visible around the Moon.  \n\nQuite by accident, another photographer was \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2F6KSS0cdkLrB6oSpJFbgcLAa36Nk312Q3EaEWf_TRDu0.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Db6f2617acbc01d2e5c81ae47ff7dcc65f743e94d\">caught</a>\nin one of the images checking his video camera.   \n\nVisible to his left are an equipment bag and a\n<a href=\"http://www.abriefourie.com/crossingcontinue_01.html\">collapsible chair</a>. \n\nA more easily visible solar eclipse will occur in just under\nfour weeks and <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\">be visible</a> from a long, thin swath of North America.",
