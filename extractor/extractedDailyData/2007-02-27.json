  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDo extrasolar planets have water?  \n\nIn an attempt to find out, the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> \nmade detailed observations of the atmospheres of two planets \nthat orbit stars other than our Sun.  \n\nUnfortunately, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor\">water vapor</a> \nwas not detected in either exoplanet.\n\nSpitzer watched star systems \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_(planet)\">HD 209458b</a> and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_189733b\">HD 189733b</a> \nclosely in infrared light both before and after the parent stars eclipsed their known planets.   \n\nBy comparing \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/eclipse_anim.html\">eclipsed</a> and uneclipsed spectra very closely, \nastronomers could deduce bright light-emitting atmospheric gasses \nthat were being blocked during eclipse.   \n\nWere water vapor one of these atmospheric gases, a new indication that <a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2250\">life</a> might exist outside of our \n<a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/solarsystem/\">Solar System</a> \nwould have been found.  \n\n\nThe planets being analyzed are known as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter\">hot Jupiters</a> -- \nthey have sizes close to \n<a href=\"ap050911.html\">Jupiter</a> but orbits closer to the distance of \n<a href=\"ap061114.html\">Mercury</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-04/ssc2007-04d.shtml\">above illustration</a> shows an artist's depiction of one of these dry worlds.\n\nAlthough no water vapor was detected this time, the techniques of measuring \n<a href=\"http://exoplanet.eu/\">exoplanet</a> \natmospheres are quite promising, and the search for distant water and other \n<a href=\"http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_signsOfLife.cfm\">biomarkers</a> \nis just beginning.",
