  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOur Sun is becoming a busy place. \n\nTaken just last week, the Sun was captured sporting numerous interesting features including one of the larger sunspot groups yet recorded: AR 1339 visible on the image right.\n\nOnly <a href=\"ap100609.html\">last year</a>, the Sun was emerging from an \n<a href=\"ap080924.html\">unusually quiet</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle\">Solar Minimum</a> that lasted for years.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/solar_nirvana2.html\">above image</a> was recorded in a \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/absorption.html\">single color</a> of light called\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">Hydrogen Alpha</a>, inverted, and false colored.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spicule_%28solar_physics%29\">Spicules</a> cover much of the Sun's face.\n\nThe gradual brightening towards the Sun's edges is caused by increased absorption of relatively cool solar gas and called \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/binstar/limbdarkening.html\">limb darkening</a>.  \n\nJust over the Sun's edges, several scintillating <a href=\"ap030707.html\">prominences</a> protrude,\nwhile prominences on the Sun's face are seen as light streaks.  \n\nPossibly the most visually interesting of all are the magnetically tangled active regions containing cool sunspots.  \n\nAs our Sun's magnetic field winds toward \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum\">Solar Maximum</a> over the next few years, \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sXfUHjXXLk\">increased \nactivity</a> will likely create times when the Sun's face is even more complex.",
