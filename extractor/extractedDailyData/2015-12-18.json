  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap120421.html\">This might look like</a> a double-bladed\nlightsaber, but these two cosmic jets actually beam outward from\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/42/\">a\nnewborn star in a galaxy near you</a>.\n\nConstructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning\nscene spans about half a light-year across\nHerbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400\n<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/02/kessel-run-12-parsecs/\">parsecs</a>\naway in the <a href=\"ap131010.html\">stellar nurseries</a>\nof the Orion B molecular cloud complex.\n\nHidden from direct view, HH 24's central protostar is\nsurrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/42/\nimage/b/\">accretion disk</a>.\n\nAs material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object it heats up.\n\nOpposing <a href=\"ap140204.html\">jets are blasted out</a> along the\nsystem's rotation axis.\n\nCutting through the region's interstellar matter, the narrow,\nenergetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/42/\nvideo/b/\">along their path</a>.",
