  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is it?  \n\nSomething is happening in a small portion of the sky toward the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellations\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries\">Aries</a>.\n\nTelescopes around the globe are tracking an unusual\ntransient there as it changes day by day.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.golf-foundation.org/images/uploaded/Cartoon%20boy%20looking%20unsure.JPG\">No one is sure</a> what it will do next.  \n\nThe entire \n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/4775.gcn3\">space mystery began</a> \non February 18 when the Earth-orbiting robot \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/spacecraft/index.html\">Swift satellite</a>\nnoticed an unusual transient began to glow dimly in \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/gamma.html\">gamma rays</a>.  \n\nDubbed GRB 060218, the object is a type of \n<a href=\"ap000702.html\">gamma ray burst</a> (GRB) but \nthe way its brightness changes is very unusual.  \n\nSince detection, \n<a href=\"http://grad40.as.utexas.edu/grblog.php?view=burst&amp;GRB=20060218A\">GRB 060218</a> has been found to emit light across the \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">electromagnetic spectrum</a>, including radio waves and visible light.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/oddball_burst.html\">Pictured above</a>, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/4777.gcn3\">image</a> of the field of GRB 060218 well prior to its Swift trigger is shown on the left, while the same field, taken by the orbiting Swift satellites' ultraviolet telescope after the Swift trigger, is shown on the right.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/4787.gcn3\">oddball GRB</a> \nis visible in the center of the right image.  \n\nSubsequent observations found a \n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/4792.gcn3\">redshift</a> for the transient of z=0.033, showing it to be only about 440 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away, \nrelatively nearby compared to typical GRBs.  \n\nWhether GRB 060218 represents a new type of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_burst\">gamma ray burst</a>, \na new type of \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a>, \nor an unusual \n<a href=\"ap020517.html\">link</a> \nbetween the GRBs and supernovas has become an instant topic of research.",
