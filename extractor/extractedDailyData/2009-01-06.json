  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow hazy is Jupiter's upper atmosphere?\n\nTo help find out, astronomers deployed the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> to watch Jupiter eclipse its moon \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)\">Ganymede</a>.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"ap070329.html\">Ganymede circles Jupiter</a> \nonce a week, a particularly useful occultation occurs more rarely.  \n\nSuch an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation\">occultation</a> \nwas captured in great visual detail in April 2007.\n\nWhen near Jupiter's limb, \n<a href=\"ap000620.html\">Ganymede</a> reflects sunlight though Jupiter's upper atmosphere, allowing astronomers to search for haze by \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001778/\">noting</a> \na slight dimming at different colors.\n\nOne result of this investigation was the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/42/image/a/\">above spectacular image</a>, where bands of clouds that circle Jupiter are clearly visible, as well as magnificent swirling storm systems such as the \n<a href=\"ap060505.html\">Great Red Spot</a>.  \n\nGanymede, at the image bottom, also shows noticeable detail on its \n<a href=\"ap990304.html\">dark icy surface</a>.\n \nSince Jupiter and Ganymede are so bright, many eclipses can be \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/galileoscope/\">seen right here</a> on Earth with a small telescope.",
