  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA huge eruptive prominence is seen moving out from our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> in this condensed half-hour time-lapse sequence.  \n\nTen Earths could easily fit in the \"claw\" of \nthis seemingly solar monster.  \n\n<a href=\"ftp://eitv3.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/outgoing/APOD/\">This large prominence</a>, though, is significant \nnot only for its size, but its shape.  \n\nThe twisted figure eight shape \nindicates that a complex \n<a href=\"ap980629.html\">magnetic field</a> threads \nthrough the emerging \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">solar particles</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/press/00/pr0015.htm\">Recent evidence</a> of differential rotation inside the\nSun might help account for the surface explosion.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spacescience.com/headlines/y2000/ast20jan_1.htm\">The sequence</a> was taken early this year by the \nSun-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.uio.no/~paalb/report/node15.html\">SOHO satellite</a>.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"ap970127.html\">large prominence</a>s \nand energetic \n<a href=\"ap000309.html\">Coronal Mass Ejection</a>s \n(CMEs) are relatively rare, \nthey are occurring more frequently now that we are near the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/predict.htm\">Solar Maximum</a>, a time of \npeak sunspot and \n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/~reames/DARK7.HTML\">solar activity</a> in the eleven-year \n<a href=\"http://www.sunspotcycle.com/\">solar cycle</a>.",
