  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/spacecraft/\">robot spacecraft NEAR</a> lowers itself toward \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/eros/\">asteroid 433 Eros</a>, \nmore surface details are becoming visible.  \n\nLast week's\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/news/flash/00mar02_1b.html\">maneuvers</a> brought \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/intro/faq.html\">NEAR</a> \nto within 204 kilometers of the floating mountain's \n<a href=\"ap000216.html\">surface</a>.  \n\nWith increased resolution,\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/archive.html\">NEAR's camera</a> then documented \n<a href=\"ap000210.html\">Eros' unusual shape</a>, \n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">craters</a> large and small, \n<a href=\"ap970905.html\">boulders</a>,\nand mysterious grooves similar to \n<a href=\"ap980712.html\">asteroid Gaspra</a> and \n<a href=\"ap980914.html\">Martian moon Phobos</a>.  \n\nIf you could stand on \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/eros/sum.html\">Eros</a>, \nyou would still be too small to be visible on \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20000306/index.html\">this recent image</a>, which shows features as small\nas 20 meters across.  \n\nHowever, you would feel \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/news/flash/00feb15_2.html\">gravity only 1/1000 that on Earth</a>, so that \nyou could easily jump over even this large 5 kilometer wide crater.",
