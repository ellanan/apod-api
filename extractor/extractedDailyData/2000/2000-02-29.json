  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nEven as leap days go, today is a remarkable one.  \n\nIn 46 BC, \n<a href=\"http://peicommerce.com/HISTORY/ROMAN/CAESAR/CAESAR.HTM\">Julius Caesar</a>, pictured above in a self-decreed minted coin, \ncreated a calendar system that added one \n<a href=\"http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/leaflets/2000/2000.html\">leap day</a> every four years.\n\nActing on advice by Alexandrian astronomer \n<a href=\"http://www.csd.uch.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks.html\">Sosigenes</a>, Caesar did this to make up for the fact that the \nEarth's year is slightly more than 365 days.  \n\nIn modern terms, the time it takes for the Earth to circle \nthe Sun is slightly more than the time it takes for the \nEarth to rotate 365 times (with respect to the Sun -- actually\nwe now know this takes about 365.24219 rotations).\n\nSo, if calendar years contained 365 days they would drift\nfrom the actual year by about 1 day every 4 years. \n\nEventually July (named posthumously for \n<a href=\"http://www.greenheart.com/billh/julian.html\">Julius Caesar</a> himself) \nwould occur during the northern hemisphere winter! \n\nBy adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the \n<a href=\"http://www.greenheart.com/billh/gregory.html\">calendar year</a> would drift much less.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.magnet.ch/serendipity/hermetic/cal_stud/cal_art.htm\">Julian Calendar</a> system was used until the year 1582 when \n<a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/Popes/ppgr13.htm\">Pope Gregory XIII</a> added that leap days \nshould not occur in years ending in \"00\" except \nif divisible by 400, providing further fine-tuning. \n\nThis <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/gregorian_calendar.html\">Gregorian Calendar </a> system is the one in common use today. \n\nTherefore, even though this year 2000 ends in \"00\", it remains a \n<a href=\"http://www.treasure-troves.com/astro/LeapYear.html\">leap year</a>, and today is the added leap day.\n\nThat makes today the first leap day\n<a href=\"http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/faq/docs/leap_years.html\">for a centurial year</a> since year 1600 and the second\nsuch leap day of the Gregorian Calendar.",
