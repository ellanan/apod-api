  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAsteroid 433 Eros is posing several riddles.  NASA's \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/tech_digest/index.htm\">robot spacecraft NEAR</a> began orbiting the 30-kilometer \nspace rock last week, and \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/archive.html\">new pictures</a> are now being \nbeamed back to Earth regularly.  \n\nAs usual in \n<a href=\"http://www.aaas.org/\">science</a>, \nwhen you arrive at a place you've \n<a href=\"ap980519.html\">never been before</a>, \nyou see things you \n<a href=\"ap980302.html\">don't immediately understand</a>. \n\nScientists are \n<a href=\"http://www.jhuapl.edu/public/pr/000217.htm\">contemplating</a>, for example, the cause of the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20000217c/index.html\">above-pictured</a> giant gouge in the middle of Eros.  \n\nIntriguing internal features include groves oriented \nparallel to the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>'s length and the relative paucity of craters.  \n\nThese indicate that the gouge formed well after the \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/asteroid.htm\">asteroid</a> itself.  \n\nOne question answered by the shape and density is that, \nunlike asteroid <a href=\"ap970701.html\">253 Mathilde</a>, \nEros is not a \n<a href=\"http://www.jhuapl.edu/public/pr/space/NEAR/mathild.htm\">pile of rocks</a> but one \n<a href=\"ap000102.html\">big rock</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/\">Astronomers</a> are \nhopeful that data taken over the coming year might \nindicate the nature and origin of the baffling bright patches.",
