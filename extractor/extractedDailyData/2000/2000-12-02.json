  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nResearch\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/balloon/\nballoon_top.html\">balloon flights</a>\nconducted in 1912 by Austrian physicist Victor Hess\nrevealed that the Earth was constantly bombarded by high energy\nradiation from space - which\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/topics/snr_group/\ncosmic_rays.html\">came to be called \"Cosmic Rays\"</a>. \n\n<i>What are Cosmic Rays and where do they come from?</i>\n\nThey are now known to be mostly subatomic particles - predominantly\nprotons and electrons -\nbut their origin is a long standing mystery.\n\nAfter almost a century of study,\nthis cosmic puzzle may have been at least partially solved by\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/astroe_lc/\">X-ray images\nand spectra</a> from the\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/ascagof.html\">ASCA satellite observatory</a>.\n\nPieced together to show the region around a star observed to go\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960612.html\">supernova</a> in 1006 AD, the overlapping X-ray snapshots above\n(seen in false color) reveal the bright rims of\nthe exploded star's still expanding\n<a href=\"ap980618.html\">blast</a> wave.\n\n<a href=\"http://heasarc/docs/asca/science/graphics/09sep1996/docs/\nsnr_cosmic.html\">These ASCA observations showed</a> for the\nfirst time that the energy spectrum of the bright regions is like that\nproduced by extremely high energy electrons\nstreaming through a magnetic field at nearly the speed of light.\n\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/science/cosmic.html\">If (as expected)</a> high energy protons are associated with\nthese energetic electrons\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/science/science_snr.html\">then supernova remnants like SN 1006</a> are sources of Hess'\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmic-ray.org/\">puzzling Cosmic Rays</a>.",
