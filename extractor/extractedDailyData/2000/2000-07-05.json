  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe center of our Galaxy is obscured in \nvisible light by dark dust that rotates \nwith the stars in the \n<a href=\"ap990224.html\">Galactic Plane</a>.  \n\nIn this century, however, \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">sensors have been developed</a> \nthat can detect light more red that \n<a href=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/projects/vishuman/VisibleHuman.html\">humans</a> can see - light called \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/infrared.html\">infrared</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/2mass_msx_gc.html\">above picture</a> shows what the \n<a href=\"ap000629.html\">Galactic Center</a> \nlooks like in three increasingly red bands of \n<a href=\"http://dept.physics.upenn.edu/~inr/astronews/infrared.html\">near-infrared</a> light.  \n\nThe picture results from a digital combination of data \nrecently taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/2mass_msx_gc.html\">2MASS</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/ipac/msx/msx.html\">MSX</a> Galactic surveys.  \n\nIn near-<a href=\"http://www.scimedia.com/chem-ed/light/em-spec.htm\">infrared</a> light (shown in blue) the \n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Mathis/Mathis_contents.html\">dust</a> is less opaque and many previously shrouded \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/971016.html\">red giant</a> stars become visible.  \n\nIn the mid-infrared (shown in red) the \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> itself glows brightly, \nbut allows us a view very close to our tumultuous and mysterious \n<a href=\"ap990621.html\">Galactic Center</a>.",
