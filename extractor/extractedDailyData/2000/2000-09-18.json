  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLast Monday the crew of <a href=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/atlantis.html\">Space Shuttle Atlantis</a> took in \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-106/html/s106e5056.html\">this view</a> as they approached the developing \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/reference/faq/index.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS).  \n\n\nFrom top to bottom, the astronauts saw a station \ncurrently consisting of the Progress supply module, the \n<a href=\"http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/assembly2_overview.htm\">Zvezda service module</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/element1.htm\">Zarya cargo module</a>, and the \n<a href=\"http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/element2.htm\">Unity connecting module</a>.  \n\nNever before had astronauts seen the \nstation since the remote-controlled additions of <a href=\"http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/launches/progress_prelaunch_000805.html\">Progress</a> and \n<a href=\"ap000718.html\">Zvezda</a>.  \n\nEnergy collecting flat <a href=\"http://www.qrg.nwu.edu/projects/vss/docs/Power/1-what-are-solar-panels.html\">solar panels</a> can be seen extending from some of the modules. \n\nSoon after this picture was taken, Atlantis docked with the \n<a href=\"http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/\">ISS</a> at the \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-106/html/s106e5061.html\">Unity</a> end.  \n\nThe astronauts have \n<a href=\"http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/STS-106/index.htm\">worked hard</a> unloading supplies, \ninstalling and testing equipment, \nand even planning to reboost the \n<a href=\"ap990223.html\">floating space station</a> \nto a higher orbit.  \n\nThe Shuttle and its entire crew are \nscheduled to return to Earth Wednesday.   \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/discovery.html\">Space Shuttle Discovery</a> is then \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-92/index.html\">scheduled to visit</a> the ISS in two weeks.",
