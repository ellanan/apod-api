  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nComet LINEAR's tail appears to be extending.  \n\nMany sky watchers are closely following Comet \n<a href=\"ap000704.html\">C/1999 S4 LINEAR</a> \nand wondering if it will develop an \n<a href=\"ap980717.html\">impressive tail</a> or become \nvisible to the naked eye later this month.  \n\nSo far, the unpredictable comet is moving oddly indicating that \n<a href=\"ap970213.html\">exploding caverns</a> \nof heated gas are causing the \n<a href=\"http://www.cometlinear.com/\">comet</a> \nto shift slightly in its \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1999S4\">orbit</a> around the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a>.  \n\nThis volatility contributes to \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/comets/0007linearS4.html\">Comet LINEAR</a> newly visible two-degree tail, discernable in the \n<a href=\"http://www.comet-track.com/s4/s4.html\">above photograph</a>ic \nnegative taken Friday from \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ca.us/\">California</a>.  \n\nCurrent \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/1999S4_1.html\">brightness estimates</a> indicate that \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast05jul_1m.htm\">Comet LINEAR</a> will just barely become visible \nwithout binoculars in northern skies in the days surrounding July 23\nduring the early evening hours.",
