  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nM19 appears to be a typical \n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular cluster</a> of stars - \nexcept for its shape.\n\nIf one looks closely at the cluster, \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0567.html\">pictured above</a>, \nit appears to be longer (top to bottom) than it is wide.  \n\nIn fact, <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m019.html\">M19</a> is the most aspherical \n<a href=\"http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/research/gcs.html\">globular cluster</a> of the approximately 160 \nknown orbiting the \n<a href=\"ap990911.html\">center</a> of our \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nM19 lies about 27,000 light-years away, measures about 60 \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/light_years.html\">light-years</a> across, \nand is home to over 100,000 stars.  \n\nThe cluster can be found with binoculars towards the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://einstein.stcloudstate.edu/Dome/constellns/oph.html\">Ophiuchus</a>.\n\nThe reason for the clusters' odd shape remains unknown, \nbut might be related to the clusters' close (5000 light-year) \nproximity to the <a href=\"ap990128.html\">Galactic Center</a>. \n\nAlternatively, the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978AJ.....83..167C\">shape might be an illusion</a> created by an \nunusual lane of dark absorbing \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> on one side of the cluster.",
