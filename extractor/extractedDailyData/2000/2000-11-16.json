  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhile stationed in  \n<a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zi.html\">central Africa</a> in December 1944, Norman Appleton \nwitnessed a \n<a href=\"http://www.corvus.com/aa01faq2.htm\">meteor</a> so bright he remembered it his entire life.  \n\nRight before his eyes a tremendous smoking \n<a href=\"ap991202.html\">fireball</a> \nstreaked across the daytime sky.  \n\nYears later, as an accomplished member of the \n<a href=\"http://www.gava.org.uk/\">Guild of Aviation Artists</a>, \nhe recorded his memories in the \n<a href=\"http://www.public.iastate.edu/~pnapplet/\">above painting</a>.  \n\nTonight and tomorrow mark the peak of this year's \n<a href=\"http://leonids.com/\">Leonid meteor shower</a>.  \n\nAlthough any individual observer is unlikely to see a \n<a href=\"ap991112.html\">fireball</a> as spectacular as this one, \nobservers in dark locations \n<a href=\"http://spacescience.com/headlines/y2000/ast10oct_1.htm\">might witness</a> as many as hundreds of \n<a href=\"ap991124.html\">transient streaks</a> of light \n<a href=\"ap981208.html\">emanating from the constellation of Leo</a> \nacross a morning moonlit sky.",
