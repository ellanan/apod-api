  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe distance record for a \n<a href=\"http://msgc.engin.umich.edu/\ncgi-bin/tour.cgi?link=/the_universe/QSO.html\">quasar</a>\nhas been broken yet again.  \n\nAt the present time, no other object in the \n<a href=\"ap990905.html\">universe</a> \nhas been found to be more distant than the above speck.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20000413.qso.html\">recently discovered</a> quasar has been clocked \nat redshift 5.82.  \n\nThe exact relation between \n<a href=\"http://www2.bc.edu/~lazarewi/expand.htm\">redshift</a> and distance remains \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate.html\">presently unknown</a>, although surely higher \nredshifts do mean greater distance.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20000413.qso.img2.html\">above quasar</a> is likely billions of \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> away and so is seen when the \n<a href=\"ap970821.html\">universe was younger</a> \nthan one billion years old, \nless than a tenth of its present age.  \n\nLike all \n<a href=\"http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/quasars.html\">quasars</a>, this object is probably a \n<a href=\"ap991017.html\">large black hole</a> \nin the center of a distant galaxy.\n\nDon't close the \n<a href=\"ap970731.html\">record</a> book yet, though.  \n\nThe redshifts to several \n<a href=\"ap981211.html\">other SDSS-discovered quasars</a> \nare currently being measured, \nsome of which might have \n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20000413.qso.img2.html\">redshifts</a> greater than six.",
