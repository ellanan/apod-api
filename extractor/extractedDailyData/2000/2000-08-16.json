  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan unusual giant galaxy NGC 1316 help calibrate the universe?  \n\nQuite possibly -- if it turns out this atypical galaxy \nis composed of typical stars.  \n\nNGC 1316, \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-17-00.html\">pictured above</a>, is most obviously strange because \nit has a size and shape common for an \n<a href=\"elliptical_galaxies.html\">elliptical galaxy</a> but \n<a href=\"ap980116.html\">dust lanes</a> and a disk \nmore commonly found in a \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a>.  \n\nThese attributes could be caused by \n<a href=\"ap980710.html\">interactions</a> with \nanother galaxy over the past billion years.  \n\nMost recently, \n<a href=\"ap990222.html\">NGC 1316</a> has been monitored to find \n<a href=\"ap991215.html\">novae</a>, explosions emanating from \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf</a> stars that should \nhave a <a href=\"http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/astronomy/13217\">standard brightness</a>.  \n\nAgain, \n<a href=\"http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~mackie/atlas/index/n1316/n1316.html\">NGC 1316</a> was found atypical in that the nova rate \nwas unexpectedly high.  \n\nIf, however, the stars and \n<a href=\"white_dwarfs.html\">white dwarfs</a> that compose \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....115..514M\">NGC 1316</a> are typical, then the \n<a href=\"http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/novae.htm\">novae</a> observed should be just as bright as \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/novae/novae.html\">novae</a> in other galaxies so that astronomers can \nuse them to compute an <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/0398cosmos/0398freedman.html\">accurate distance</a>.  \n\nThis distance can then be used to calibrate other \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/distance.htm\">distance indicators</a> and result in a more accurate \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">scale for distances</a> throughout the \n<a href=\"http://www.drscience.com/vault/981023.htm\">universe</a>.",
