  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAs the Moon passed almost directly through the center\nof Earth's shadow on July 16th,\n<a href=\"http://www.live-eclipse.org/eclipse/lunar00/index.html\">sky\ngazers</a> in the\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/eclipses/\n0007threeeclipses.shtml\">Pacific hemisphere</a> were graced by a\n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/extra/\nTLE2000Jul16.html\">lingering lunar eclipse</a>.\n\nThe total phase lasted 1 hour and 47 minutes, the\nlongest since 1859.\n\nA longer <a href=\"http://www.MrEclipse.com/Special/\nLEprimer.html\">total lunar eclipse</a> won't occur until\nthe year 3000.\n\nTaking advantage of the\n<a href=\"http://www.rasnz.org.nz/Events2000.htm#Eclipse\">lengthy\ntotality</a>, astronomer and photographer,\nNoel Munford used a small telescope to\nrecord this colourful picture of the\n<a href=\"ap960403.html\">eclipsed Moon</a> and nearby\nstars in the skies above Palmerston North,\n<a href=\"http://www.rasnz.org.nz/index.htm\">New Zealand</a>.\n\nNear the top in this\n<a href=\"http://members.netro.com.au/~michael/astro/polar.htm\">southern\nhemisphere</a> perspective\nis the 84 kilometer wide bright ray crater Tycho.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/images/moonmap.jpg\">The Moon</a>\nlooks red even when it lies completely in\nshadow because it is still illuminated by sunlight reddened by dust\nand refracted by the atmosphere along the Earth's limb.\n\nChanges in atmospheric dust content mean that\n<a href=\"http://eclipse99.ksc.nasa.gov/pages/\ntraditions.html\">each eclipse</a> can have a different appearance.\n\nAn experienced observer, Munford comments that at mid totality\nthis eclipse had a more uniform, delicate, subtle colour and\nwas one of the lightest he has seen.",
