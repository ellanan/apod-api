  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn February 14th,\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/\">the NEAR spacecraft</a> became\nthe first artificial <a href=\"ap991014.html\">moon of an asteroid</a>.\n\nCaptured by the gentle gravity of a 20 mile long\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20000214b/index.html\">slipper-shaped</a> mountain of rock,  NEAR recorded\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20000214g/index.html\">this premier image</a> while\norbiting asteroid 433 Eros at a distance of about 200 miles.\n\nThe image shows features as small as 100 feet across in a view\ndominated by a 3 mile wide crater near Eros' narrow waist.\n\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/news/sci_updates/00feb15.html\">Enticing</a>\nlayers and grooves are visible within the crater rim along\nwith an enormous 170 foot boulder lying on the crater floor\n(near picture center).\n\nAlthough Eros is a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">large S-type near-earth asteroid</a>,\nit is still not massive enough\nfor its own gravity to have shaped it into a\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/95/20.html\">planet-like</a> spherical form.\n\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/asteroidfact.html\">By comparison</a>, Eros has less than a thousandth Earth's gravity, so\na 100 pound object on Earth would weigh about 1 <i>ounce</i>\non Eros.\n\nA baseball thrown at 22 miles per hour would\ncompletely escape into space.\n\nThe weak gravity and irregular shape make orbiting Eros\na delicate challenge\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/intro/faq.html\">for NEAR's</a> controllers who\nplan a year long exploration program with possible\nclose approaches to\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20000215/index.html\">the asteroid's surface</a>.",
