  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA big beautiful spiral galaxy 2 million light-years away,\n<a href=\"ap991114.html\">Andromeda (M31)</a>\nhas long been touted as an analog to the Milky Way,\na distant mirror of our own galaxy.\n\nThe popular 1960s British sci-fi series,\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tildeImages/Film/\nAndromeda/index.html\">A For Andromeda</a>,\neven postulated that it was home to another technological civilization\nthat <a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/vol1no2/sagan.htm\">communicated</a>\nwith us.\n\nUsing the newly unleashed observing power of the orbiting\n<a href=\"ap990727.html\">Chandra</a> X-ray telescope,\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/00_releases/press_011400m31.html\">astronomers have now imaged</a> the\ncenter of our near-twin\n<a href=\"ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">island universe</a>, finding evidence\nfor an object so bizarre it would have impressed many\n<a href=\"http://www.magicdragon.com/UltimateSF/timeline1970.html\">60s science fiction</a> writers (and readers).\n\n<a href=\"ap000120.html\">Like the Milky Way</a>,\nAndromeda's galactic center appears to\nharbor an X-ray source characteristic of\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/black_holes.html\">a black hole</a> of a million or more solar masses.\n\nSeen above,\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/0007/index.html\">the false-color X-ray picture</a> shows a number of\nX-ray sources, likely\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/binary.html\">X-ray binary stars</a>, within\nAndromeda's central region as yellowish dots.\n\nThe blue source located right at the galaxy's center is coincident\nwith the position of the suspected massive black hole.\n\nWhile\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/xrays.html\">the X-rays</a> are produced as material falls into the\nblack hole and heats up, estimates from the X-ray data show Andromeda's\ncentral source to be surprisingly cool - only a million\ndegrees or so compared to the tens of millions of degrees\nindicated for Andromeda's <a href=\"ap991219.html\">X-ray binaries</a>.",
