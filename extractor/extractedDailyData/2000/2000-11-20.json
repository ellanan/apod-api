  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe Leonid Meteor Shower this year could be \ndescribed as good but not great.  \n\nDuring November 17 and 18 the Earth crossed \nthrough several streams of \n<a href=\"ap981121.html\">sand-sized grit</a> \nleft orbiting the Sun by \n<a href=\"ap991113.html\">Comet Tempel-Tuttle</a>.  \n\nSeveral distinct peaks in \n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/leo99/leo99index.html\">meteor activity were reported</a>, \nwith rates approaching 400 meteors per hour \nfor brief periods for some dark locations.  \n\nPictured above, a \n<a href=\"http://leonids.hq.nasa.gov/leonids/\">Leonid meteor</a> was caught from \n<a href=\"http://www.state.fl.us\">Florida</a> \nstreaking through the \n<a href=\"ap000611.html\">constellation of Orion</a> \non the morning of 2000 November 18.  \n\nVisible as a red-tinged smudge to the left of the \nthree nearly linear stars that compose \n<a href=\"http://www.itss.raytheon.com/cafe/qadir/q1981.html\">Orion's belt</a> is the picturesque star-forming region known as the \n<a href=\"ap001122.html\">Orion Nebula</a>.  \n\nNext year, the \n<a href=\"http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/info2000.html\">Leonids Meteor Shower is expected</a> \nby many to be much more active.",
