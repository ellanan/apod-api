  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHot gas frequently erupts from the Sun.  \n\nOne such eruption produced the glowing filament \n<a href=\"http://vestige.lmsal.com/TRACE/POD/TRACEpodarchive3.html\">pictured above</a>, which was captured on July 19 by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://vestige.lmsal.com/TRACE/Project/Mission/mission.htm\">TRACE satellite</a>.  \n\nThe filament, although small compared to the \noverall size of the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a>, measures over 100,000 kilometers in height, \nso that the entire \n<a href=\"earth.html\">Earth</a> could easily fit \ninto its outstretched arms.  \n\nGas in the filament is funneled by the complex and changing \n<a href=\"http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/solarmag.html\">magnetic field of the Sun</a>.  \n\nAfter \n<a href=\"ap000403.html\">lifting off</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap970108.html\">Sun's surface</a>, most of the \n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Program/hfilament.html\">filamentary gas</a> will eventually fall back.  \n\nMore powerful \n<a href=\"ap960916.html\">solar eruptions</a> \nemit particles that reach the Earth and \n<a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/news/06072000_solar.html\">can disrupt manmade satellites</a>. \n\nThe cause and nature of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...537..503G\">solar eruptions</a> are the topic of much research.",
