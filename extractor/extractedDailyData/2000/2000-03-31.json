  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ras.org.uk/press/pn00-04.htm\">This false-colour image</a>\nof the young Trapezium star cluster in the Orion\nNebula was made with an\n<a href=\"http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/instruments/\nufti/ufti.html\">infrared camera</a> at wavelengths about\ntwice as long as visible light.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/\ndiscovery.html\">infrared</a> data are part of a sensitive survey \nof this nearby star forming region in which\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0003061\">astronomers\nhave identified</a> over 100 extremely low mass\nobjects -- candidates for\n<a href=\"ap951204.html\">elusive</a> brown dwarf stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/97articles/\nmartin.html\">Brown dwarfs</a> are failed\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/background-text/\nbrdwarfs.txt\">stars</a> with masses so low (about 8% of the Sun's)\nthat they can not sustain nuclear hydrogen burning, a sun-like star's main\n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/default.html\">energy source</a>.\n\nWhile brown dwarfs are thought to be still massive enough to burn\n<a href=\"http://www.uilondon.org/D.HTM#deuterium\">deuterium</a> for energy,\nthirteen of the low mass objects show evidence of\nlying below even the deuterium burning limit\n(about 1.3% of the\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\nsunfact.html\">Sun's</a> mass) falling in a range \nmore commensurate with giant planets.\n\nThese drifting, \"free-floating planets\" are perhaps as little as 8\ntimes as massive as\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\njupiterfact.html\">Jupiter</a> and likely formed along with the cluster stars\na million or so years ago.\n\nThey are detectable in the infrared because they\nare still hot from formation, but will eventually cool and fade.\n\nIf the <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/\nm042_more.html\">Trapezium</a> is typical of young\n<a href=\"ap000227.html\">star clusters</a>, then\nthe survey results suggest that brown dwarfs\nand free-floating planets may be fairly common, but there\nare not enough to solve the mystery\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter.html\">of dark\nmatter</a> in the Universe.",
