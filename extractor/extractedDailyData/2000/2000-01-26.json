  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDuring last week's <a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEextra/TLE2000Jan20.html\">lunar eclipse</a>, our <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html\">Moon</a> appeared to disappear.  \n\nAs the Earth moved between the Moon and the Sun, the \nEarth's shadow fell on the moon, making it \n<a href=\"ap970110.html\">quite dark</a>.  \n\nIn the above photograph, the Earth's rotation caused the \nMoon and stars to \n<a href=\"ap980912.html\">appear as streaks</a> \nduring this four-hour exposure.  \n\nIn the foreground is the abbey of the Benedictive monastery of \n<a href=\"http://www.culturamatadepera.es/tpobl01a.htm\">Sant Llorenc del Munt</a>, a structure in Girona, Spain \nthat has stood since the eleventh century.  \n\nAs the Earth's shadow \n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/LEcat/LEcatalog.html\">engulfed the Moon</a>, the Moon streak became less and less bright, \npractically disappearing during \n<a href=\"ap960926.html\">totality</a>.  \n\n\nAt this time, the Moon, which normally shines by \nreflecting direct sunlight, shone only by sunlight <a href=\"http://www.geom.umn.edu/education/calc-init/rainbow/refraction.html\">refracted</a> through the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.   Later, clouds obscured the re-appearing Moon.",
