  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTen thousand years ago, before the dawn of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_334000/334517.stm\">recorded human history</a>, \na new light must suddenly have appeared in the \nnight sky and faded after a few weeks.  \n\nToday we know this light was an <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/supernovae.html\">exploding star</a> and record the colorful expanding cloud as the \n<a href=\"http://nineplanets.org/twn/cygnusx.html\">Veil Nebula</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://robgendler.astrodigitals.com/Nebulas.html\">Pictured above</a> is the west end of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/E_SUM_N/VEIL.HTM\">Veil Nebula</a> known technically as \n<a href=\"http://www.ngcic.com/dss/dss_images.htm\">NGC</a> 6960 \nbut less formally as the Witch's Broom Nebula.  \n\nThe rampaging gas gains its colors by impacting and \n<a href=\"ap960307.html\">exciting existing</a> nearby gas. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"supernova_remnants.html\">supernova remnant</a> lies about \n1400 light-years away towards the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.multimania.com/cdadfs/constellation/cygne/cygnus.htm\">Cygnus</a>.  \n\nThis Witch's Broom actually spans over three times the \nangular size of the full\n<a href=\"moon.html\">Moon</a>.  \n\nThe bright blue star 52 \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/cygnus.html\">Cygnus</a> is visible with the unaided eye from \na dark location but unrelated to the ancient \n<a href=\"http://www.chapman.edu/oca/benet/intro_sn.htm\">supernova</a>.",
