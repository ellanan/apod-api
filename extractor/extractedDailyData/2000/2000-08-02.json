  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe Crescent Nebula is a rapidly expanding shell \nof gas surrounding a dying star.  \n\nIn <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/2000/23/pr-photos.html\">this recently released image</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/HSToverview.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, a bright dynamic part of the \nnebula three light-years across is shown in representative color.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ne.jp/asahi/stellar/scenes/object_e/ngc6888.htm\">Crescent Nebula</a> began to form about 250,000 years ago as central \n<a href=\"ap970928.html\">Wolf-Rayet</a> star WR 136 began to \nshed its outer envelope in a strong \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">stellar wind</a>, expelling the equivalent of our \nSun's mass every 10,000 years.  \n\nThis <a href=\"http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/sun_wind.htm\">wind</a> has been impacting surrounding \n<a href=\"ap000412.html\">interstellar gas</a>, \ncompacting it into a series of complex shells, and lighting it up. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~maltmann/n6888colinfo.html\">Crescent Nebula</a>, \nalso known as NGC 6888, lies about 4,700 \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/question94.htm\">light-years</a> away in the \n<a href=\"http://www.eaglequest.net/~bondono/iconst.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/cygnus.html\">Cygnus</a> and can only be seen through a telescope. \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996A%26A...316..133G\">Star WR 136</a> will probably undergo a \n<a href=\"supernova_remnants.html\">supernova</a> explosion sometime \nin the next million years.",
