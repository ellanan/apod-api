  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe Pelican Nebula is slowly being transformed.  \n\nIC 5070, the official designation, is divided from the larger \n<a href=\"ap000501.html\">North America Nebula</a> by a \n<a href=\"ap990511.html\">molecular cloud</a> filled with dark \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dust</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.usit.com/mccubbin/Pelican.html\">Pelican</a>, however, receives much study because it \nis a particularly active mix of \n<a href=\"ap990502.html\">star formation</a> and \nevolving gas clouds.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0555.html\">above picture</a> was produced in two specific colors \nto better understand these interactions.  \n\nHere, hot \n<a href=\"http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/h.html\">hydrogen</a> \ngas glows in red, while cooler \n<a href=\"http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/S.html\">Sulfur</a> glows blue-green.  \n\nThe light from young energetic stars is slowly \ntransforming the cold gas to hot gas, \nwith the <a href=\"ap981118.html\">advancing boundary</a> \nbetween the two known as an \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/ionization.html\">ionization</a> front.  \n\nParticularly dense filaments of cold gas are seen to still remain.  \n\nMillions of years from now this nebula might no longer \nbe known as the \n<a href=\"http://www.phillyzoo.org/pz0012.htm\">Pelican</a>, \nas the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1980ApJ...239..121B\">balance and placement of stars and gas</a> \nwill leave something that appears completely different.",
