  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBritish astronomer\n<a href=\"http://star.arm.ac.uk/history/herschel.html\">Sir William Herschel</a> discovered Titania and Oberon in\nJanuary of 1787.\n\nHe wasn't\n<a href=\"http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/works.html\">reading Shakespeare's</a> <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> though,\nhe was making the first telescopic observations of moons of\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html\">the planet Uranus</a> (a planet which he himself\n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/\nHistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html\">discovered in 1781</a>).\n\nIn January of 1986, nearly 200 years later,\nNASA's robot explorer Voyager 2 became the only spacecraft to visit\nthe remote <a href=\"ap990531.html\">Uranian</a>\n<a href=\"ap971103.html\">system</a>.\n\nAbove is Voyager's highest resolution\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/\nPIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA00039\">picture of Titania</a>, Uranus' largest\nmoon.\n\nThe picture is a composite of two images recorded from a distance\nof 229,000 miles.\n\n<a href=\"ap960304.html\">The icy, rocky world</a> is seen to be covered with impact craters.\n\nA prominent system of fault valleys, some nearly 1,000 miles long,\nis visible as trench-like features\nnear the terminator (shadow line).\n\nDeposits of highly reflective material which may represent frost\ncan be seen along the sun-facing valley walls.\n\nThe large impact crater near the top,\n<a href=\"http://wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov/USGSFlag/Space/nomen/uranus/titacrat.html\">known as Gertrude</a>, is about \n180 miles across.\n\nAt the bottom the 60 mile wide fault valley,\n<a href=\"http://wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov/USGSFlag/Space/nomen/uranus/titachas.html\">Belmont Chasma</a>, cuts into crater Ursula.\n\n<a href=\"http://wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov/USGSFlag/Space/wall/titania.html\">Titania itself</a> is 1,000 miles in diameter.",
