  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOver the course of billions of years, \nwhole clusters of galaxies merge.  \n\nAbove is an \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/xrays.html\">X-ray</a> image of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...472..137H\">Abell 2142</a>, the result of the collision of two huge \n<a href=\"clusters_of_galaxies.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>, \nand one of the most massive objects known in the universe.  \n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/00_releases/press_030100a2142.html\">This false-color image</a> shows a \nconcentration of gas 50 million \n<a href=\"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/tmp.html\">degrees</a> hot near the center of the resulting cluster.  \n\nOddly, it is the relative coldness of the gas that makes \n<a href=\"http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/news/photos/2000/photos00-046.htm\">this situation</a> particularly interesting.  \n\nThe center of <a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/a2142.html\">Abell 2142</a> is surrounded by gas fully twice as hot, \na temperature thought to have been created by \nenergy released during the \n<a href=\"ap991109.html\">colossal collision</a>.  \n\nStill, since we can only see a snapshot in time, \nmuch remains unknown about how \n<a href=\"ap990328.html\">clusters of galaxies</a> \nform and coalesce.",
