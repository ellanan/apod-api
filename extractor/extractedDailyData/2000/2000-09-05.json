  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHigh atop a dormant \n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vw.html\">volcano</a> in <a href=\"http://www.state.hi.us/\">Hawaii</a>, an eye 3.6-meters wide stares at a \nfaint light on the night sky.  \n\nUnlike a <a href=\"http://www.brianseye.com/anatomy.htm\">human eye</a>, which \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/see_a_photon.html\">collects light</a> for only a fraction of a second at a time, a telescope such as the \n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/\">Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope</a> \n(CFHT) can collect light for hours. \nFaint sources become visible that were previously \n<a href=\"ap000730.html\">beyond human imagination</a>.  \n\nThese meticulous observations usually take so long, though, that the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/cgi-bin/tour_def/the_universe/uts/earth2.html\">Earth's spin</a> causes the telescope to move under the sky.  \n\nThis spin is visible in the <a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/Astros/Imageofweek/ciw070800.html\">above photograph</a> as \n<a href=\"ap000715.html\">star trails</a> in the background.  \n\nThe CFHT itself must counter-spin to keep on target.  \n\nThe enormous size of the \n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/CFHT/Tour/\">CFHT</a> dome can be gauged by the car in the foreground.  \n\nThe CFHT is one of the smaller telescopes atop \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/mko.html\">Mauna Kea</a>.",
