  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThroughout the <a href=\"http://astro.uwaterloo.ca/~mjhudson/research/\nthreed/\">Universe</a>, galaxies\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\ngalaxy_clusters.html\">tend to swarm</a> in groups\nranging from just a handful of members to casts of thousands.\n\nAstronomers have realized since the early 1970s that\nthe larger swarms, immense\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/topics/\nclusters_group/clusters_intro.html\">clusters of galaxies</a> millions of\nlight-years across, are immersed\nwithin tenuous clouds of hot gas which glow strongly in x-rays.\n\n\nThese clouds may have been heated by their collapse\nin the early Universe, but in many\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/\nillustrations/simMerger.html\">galaxy clusters</a>,\nthe gas appears to be cooling.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/\">Chandra Observatory</a>\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/0163/\nindex.html\">x-ray image reveals</a> a striking\n<a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/atlas/gloss.html#cool\">cooling flow</a>\nin the central regions of the\n<a href=\"http://crux.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters_SM.html\">galaxy\ncluster</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.willbell.com/software/hypersky/gcluster.htm\">cataloged\nas</a> Abell 1795.\n\nBrighter pixels in the false-color image represent higher x-ray\nintensities.\n\nThe bright filament down the center indicates gas condensing and\ncooling -- rapidly\n<a href=\"http://www-xray.ast.cam.ac.uk/oday/\nclusters_cflows.html\">loosing energy</a> by radiating x-rays.\n\nAt the very top of the filament is a\nlarge, x-ray bright galaxy.\n\nAs it moved through the\ncluster gas cloud, the massive galaxy's gravitational\ninfluence seems to have created this cosmic wake of denser,\n<a href=\"http://www-xray.ast.cam.ac.uk/oday/\nclusters_cflows.html\">cooling gas</a>.\n\nContinuing to cool, the cluster gas will ultimately\nprovide raw material to form future generations of stars.",
