  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThere's nothing like it in \n<a href=\"ap000130.html\">our own Galaxy</a>.  \nGlobular clusters as young as \n<a href=\"ap000729.html\">NGC 1850</a> don't exist here.  \n\n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">Globular clusters</a> \nonly 40 millions of years old \ncan still be found in the neighboring \n<a href=\"ap000222.html\">LMC</a> galaxy, \nthough, but perhaps none so unusual as \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/press-releases/94-40.txt\">NGC 1850</a>.  \n\nClose inspection of the \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/phot-15-99.html\">above photograph</a> will reveal two clusters.  \n\nBelow and right of the main group of stars known as \n<a href=\"http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~kim/thesis/node6.html\">NGC 1850</a>A is a smaller, still younger group dubbed \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1994ApJ...435L..43G\">NGC 1850B</a>.  \n\nThis cluster is made of stars \nonly about four million years old.  \n\nThe large red cloud of gas surrounding the \nclusters may have been predominantly created by \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernovae explosions</a> of stars in the younger cluster.  \n\nThe red \n<a href=\"supernova_remnants.html\">supernova remnant</a> \nN57D is visible on the upper left.",
