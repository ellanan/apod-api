  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nNGC 6791 is one of the oldest and largest \n<a href=\"ap970128.html\">open clusters of stars</a> known.  \n\nBut how did it get so dirty?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html\">Open star clusters</a> usually contain a \nfew hundred stars each less than a billion years old.  \n\n<a href=\"lib/open_clusters.html\">Open star cluster</a> \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/ps/astro-ph/9812097\">NGC 6791</a>, however, contains thousands of stars \nrecently measured to be about 8 billion years old.  \n\nWhat's really confusing, though, is that the stars of \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9503065\">NGC 6791</a> are relatively dirty - \nthe minuscule amounts of heavy \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/\">elements</a> \n(generically called metals) are high relative to most other \n<a href=\"ap981025.html\">star clusters</a>.  \n\nOlder stars are supposed to be metal poor, \nsince metals have only been slowly accumulating in our \n<a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_milky.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nThis enigma makes NGC 6791, \n<a href=\"http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~mochejsk/gallery.html\">pictured above</a>, one of the most studied \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~stauffer/opencl/\">open clusters</a> and a possible example of how \nstars might evolve in the centers of galaxies.",
