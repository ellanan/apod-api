  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOnly\n<a href=\"ap000727.html\">last month</a> the stage was set for\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1999S4\">Comet\nLINEAR</a> (C/1999S4 LINEAR)\nto become the first \"naked-eye\" comet of Y2K.\n\nIt didn't fill that role, of course, but it did turn in\na very <a href=\"http://meteors.com/cometlinear/\nkidger_update.html\">dramatic performance</a>.\n\nClosely followed by astronomer Mark Kidger and colleagues with the\n<a href=\"http://www.ing.iac.es/\">Isaac\nNewton Group</a> telescopes (La Palma,\n<a href=\"ap990410.html\">Canary</a> Islands),\ncomet LINEAR's nucleus apparently\nfragmented extensively on the night of July 25th.\n\nA faint <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/\ncomets.html\">fluorescent</a> cloud fading against a background\nof stars is all that is still\nvisible in this August 21st telescopic view\n<a href=\"http://www.ozemail.com.au/~loomberah/linear.htm\">from\nLoomberah</a>, NSW Australia.\n\nWhy did comet LINEAR break up?\n\nComets are conglomerates of\n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">ice and rock</a>.\n\nA very plausible\n<a href=\"http://www.ing.iac.es/PR/press/ing300.html\">scenario is</a>\nthat a substantial fraction of LINEAR's\nicy component was evaporated, leaving too little to\nhold the rocky material together.\n\nIn any event, no bright telltale\n<a href=\"ap000811.html\">condensations</a> remain.\n\nSo, following its first tour through the\ninner Solar System,\n<a href=\"ap000808.html\">an encore</a> from comet LINEAR\nseems unlikely!",
