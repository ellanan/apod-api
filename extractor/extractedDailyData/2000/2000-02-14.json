  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMaybe the \n<a href=\"ap991108.html\">Moon</a> owns our \n<a href=\"ap990628.html\">hearts</a>, but this won't stop \nthe occasional \n<a href=\"asteroids.html\">asteroid</a> from sending us a \n<a href=\"http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/index.html\">valentine</a>.  \n\nFriday, to the surprise of many, the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/intro/faq.html\">NEAR mission</a> on approach to asteroid \n<a href=\"ap000210.html\">433 EROS</a> photographed \nwhat appears to be a \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/news/pr/pr_00feb13.html\">heart-shaped depression</a>.  \n\nAfter NEAR reaches the asteroid today, NASA plans a \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/mission/timeline_00jan05.html\">series of maneuvers</a> to make the \nrobot spacecraft the first ever to orbit an asteroid.\n\nMore detailed \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/index.html\">pictures</a> \nwill soon be taken \nof the 33 kilometer long \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/eros/sum.html\">asteroid EROS</a> and this 5 kilometer long depression.  \n\nMost likely, fortuitous lighting and viewing angles \naccentuate the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20000213b/index.html\">apparent heart shape</a> -- but don't tell the \n<a href=\"ap000125.html\">Moon</a>.",
