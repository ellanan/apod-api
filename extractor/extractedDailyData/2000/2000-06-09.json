  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/vela/\">This\nstunning image</a> from the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/index.html\">Chandra X-ray\nObservatory</a> is centered on the Vela pulsar -- the collapsed\nstellar core within\n<a href=\"ap960612.html\">the Vela supernova remnant</a>\nsome 800 light-years distant.\n\nThe Vela pulsar is a\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\npulsars.html\">neutron star</a>.\n\nMore massive than the Sun, it has the density of an atomic nucleus.\n\nAbout 12 miles in diameter it\nspins 10 times a second as it hurtles through the\n<a href=\"ap980425.html\">supernova debris cloud</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/\nsounds.html\">pulsar's</a> electric and magnetic fields accelerate\nparticles to nearly the speed of light, powering the compact\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory1_xray.html\">x-ray</a> emission nebula revealed\nin the Chandra picture.\n\nThe cosmic crossbow shape is over 0.2 light-years across, \ncomposed of an arrow-like jet emanating from the polar region of\n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/nstar.html\">the\nneutron star</a> and bow-like inner and outer arcs believed\nto be the edges of tilted rings of x-ray\nemitting high energy particles.\n\nImpressively, the swept back compact nebula indicates the\nneutron star is moving up and to the right in this\npicture, exactly along the direction of the x-ray jet.\n\nThe Vela pulsar (and\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/velax.html\">associated\nsupernova remnant</a>) was created by a massive\nstar which exploded over 10,000 years ago.\n\nIts awesome x-ray rings and jet are reminiscent of another\nwell-known pulsar powered system,\n<a href=\"ap990929.html\">the Crab Nebula</a>.",
