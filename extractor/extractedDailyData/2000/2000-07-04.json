  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nJust possibly, a new \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html\">comet</a> may become bright enough to see without \nbinoculars later this month.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/comets/0007linearS4.html\">Comet C/1999 S4 LINEAR</a> is rapidly approaching both the \n<a href=\"earth.html\">Earth</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap000522.html\">Sun</a> from the outer \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/solar_system/\">Solar System</a>, \nand should be at its brightest around 2000 July 25 \nin the early evening sky of northern observers.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.swisr.org/newcomet.html\">comet was discovered</a> \nby chance by \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/\">project LINEAR</a> last September.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.astrophotographer.com/C1999-S4_1Jul2000.html\">above time-lapse sequence</a> of <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1999S4\">Comet LINEAR</a> was taken on 2000 July 2 from \n<a href=\"http://www.state.az.us/\">Arizona</a> \nand shows the comet's movement over only 19 minutes.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/1999S4.html\">Comet LINEAR</a>'s positions will be known quite accurately, \nthe comet's future brightness and \n<a href=\"ap000413.html\">tail</a> length can only be guessed, \nand it is quite possible that neither will become very impressive.",
