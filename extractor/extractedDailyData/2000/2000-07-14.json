  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nImpact craters are common on\n<a href=\"ap990326.html\">Earth's moon</a> but on Jupiter's large ice moon\n<a href=\"http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/features/planets/jupiter/\neuropa.html\">Europa</a>, they are very rare.\n\nOver time, both bodies have been subjected\nto an intense <a href=\"ap990610.html\">pounding</a> by the solar system's\n<a href=\"http://www.jhuapl.edu/public/pr/000530.htm\">formative debris</a>,\nbut geological activity on Europa's surface seems\nto have erased most of these impact scars.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/\nPIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA02561\">This false-color infrared image</a>\nfrom the Galileo spacecraft's\n<a href=\"http://jumpy.igpp.ucla.edu/~nims/\">NIMS instrument</a> shows\na newly discovered crater on Europa as a light red\nring feature near center surrounding a dark core.\n\nFor scale, the dark core is about 29 kilometers in diameter.\n\nOnly seven <a href=\"ap970417.html\">comparably</a> large craters\nhave now been identified on Europa's surface.\n\nRed colors in the image represent a relatively pure\n<a href=\"http://www.glacier.rice.edu/invitation/1_icetypes.html\">water\nice</a> composition while blue colors indicate\nthat other minerals are present.\n\nThe crater's central dark area may contain the remnants of the impacting\nbody.\n\nThe icy crust\n<a href=\"http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/moons/europa.html\">of Europa</a> is\nof great interest, as\n<a href=\"http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/release/\npress000110.html\">evidence mounts</a>\nthat it covers an ocean of liquid water, possibly providing suitable\nconditions for life.",
