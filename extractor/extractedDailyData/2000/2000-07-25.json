  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis is what a star really looks like from the surface of the Earth.  \n\nTo the best the \n<a href=\"http://www.unb.ca/physics/1940/HumanEye.fm.htm\">human eye</a> can see, stars are so far away they appear\nthe same as would infinitesimal points of light.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, however, is clumpy, so that \ndifferent air pockets produce different images \nof a single point-like star.  \n\nBecause the atmosphere is always \n<a href=\"http://wings.ucdavis.edu/Book/Atmosphere/beginner/wind-\n01.html\">windy</a> and changing, the number and position of <a href=\"http://www.physics.gmu.edu/classinfo/astr103/CourseNotes/Text/Lec03/Le\nc03_pt2_txt_telescopesImages.htm\">images</a> is always changing, \nwith the result that stars appear to \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/twinkle.html\">twinkle</a>.  \n\nIn reality, the \n<a href=\"http://op.ph.ic.ac.uk/speckle/movies.html\">above time-lapse sequence</a> occurs ten times faster.  \n\nClose inspection will reveal a \n<a href=\"http://op.ph.ic.ac.uk/ao/overview.html\">single small image</a> of the star that is repeated over and over.  \n\nThis image is called a \n<a href=\"http://op.ph.ic.ac.uk/speckle/speckle.html\">speckle</a> and its size is again not really infinitesimal, \nbut determined by \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction.html\">strange quantum effects</a> that involve the finite size of the telescope.  \n\nRecent work in \n<a href=\"http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu:3636/realpublic/ao/aoindex.html\">adaptive optics</a> (\"rubber mirrors\") have made \n<a href=\"ap000218.html\">spectacular advances</a> \nin reducing this atmospheric blurring.\n\n<a href=\"ap970825.html\">Betelgeuse</a> is the star twinkling above, \nand in space, above the Earth's atmosphere, \nit really looks like <a href=\"ap990605.html\">this</a>.",
