  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere are all of these meteors coming from?  \n\nIn terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.illinois.edu/~jkaler/sow/const.html\">constellation</a>\nof Perseus.  \n\nThat is why the last week's meteor shower was known as the\n<a href=\"ap080814.html\">Perseids</a> -- the meteors all appear to come from a\n<a href=\"ap070812.html\">radiant toward Perseus</a>.\n\nThree dimensionally, however,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteors\">sand-sized debris</a>\nexpelled from <a href=\"ap960219.html\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a>\nfollows a well-defined orbit about our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches Earth is superposed in front of the Perseus.\n\nTherefore, when Earth crosses this orbit, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(meteor_shower)\">radiant</a> point of falling debris appears in Perseus.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cloudbait.com/science/perseid2009.html\">Pictured above</a>, a composite image of this year's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids_meteor_shower\">Pereids meteor shower</a> shows many\n<a href=\"ap081125.html\">bright meteor</a>s that\n<a href=\"ap090302.html\">streaked</a>\nthrough the sky on August 12.  \n\nTo the surprise of many, the next night, August 13, also showed\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqn4SwglCBg\">many meteors</a>, as demonstrated by rolling one's cursor over the above image.\n\nThis year's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids\">Leonids meteor shower</a>\nin November is\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/04dec_leonids2009.htm\">expected by some</a> to be exceptionally active,\nperhaps producing as many as 500 meteors per hour.",
