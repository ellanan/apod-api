  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nPictured above,\n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/dec00_seds/wcandor/\nindex.html\">layers upon layers</a> stretch across\nthe floor of West Candor Chasma\n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/7_20_98_marineris_rel/\nall_valles_lbld.gif\">within</a> the immense martian\n<a href=\"ap971017.html\">Valles Marineris</a>.\n\nCovering an area 1.5 by 2.9 kilometers, the full image\nfrom the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft shows\nover 100 individual beds.\n\nEach strikingly uniform layer is smooth, hard enough to form steep edges,\nand is 10 to 11 meters thick.\n\nIn a\n<a href=\"ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2000/00-190.txt\">press\nconference</a> yesterday scientists Michael Malin\nand Ken Edgett presented this and other\n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/dec00_seds/index.html\">new\nimages which show</a> that the layered patterns exist at widespread\nlocations near the martian equator.\n\nTheir results indicate that some of the layered regions may be 3.5 billion\nyears old.\n\nOn planet Earth, layered patterns like these are formed from sediment\ndeposited over time by large bodies of water.\n\nLikewise, the layered beds\n<a href=\"ap970627.html\">on Mars</a> may be\nsedimentary rock formed in\n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/1196issue/1196kargel.html\">ancient lakes\nand seas</a>.\n\nThe researchers caution, however, that other uniquely martian\nprocesses may be responsible for the layering.\n\nDid life arise on <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/mars/science/\nancient/\">ancient Mars</a>?\n\nBecause of their possible association with water,\na prime location for\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/mars/\">future</a>\nsearches for fossil remains of\nmartian life would be within these layers of Mars.",
