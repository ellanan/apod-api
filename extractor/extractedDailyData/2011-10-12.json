  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSaturn's rings form one of the larger sundials known.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial\">sundial</a>, however, determines only the \n<a href=\"ap030405.html\">season</a> of Saturn, not the time of day.\n\nIn 2009, during \n<a href=\"ap090825.html\">Saturn's last equinox</a>, Saturn's thin rings threw \n<a href=\"ap091110.html\">almost no shadows</a> onto Saturn, since the ring plane pointed directly toward the Sun.\n\nAs Saturn continued in its orbit around the Sun, however, the ring shadows become increasingly wider and cast further south. \n\nThese shadows are not easily visible from the Earth because from our vantage point near the Sun, the rings \n<a href=\"http://addictedtoinsight.com/aihome/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frustration1.png\">always block</a> the shadows.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14576\">above image</a> was taken in August by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Saturn.\n\nThe rings themselves appear as a vertical bar on the image right.\n\nThe Sun, far to the upper right, shines through the rings and casts captivatingly \n<a href=\"ap101012.html\">complex shadows</a> on south Saturn, on the image left.\n\nCassini has been \n<a href=\"ap110613.html\">exploring Saturn</a>, \nits rings, and its moons since 2004, and is \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20100203/\">expected to continue</a> until at least the maximum elongation of Saturn's shadows occurs in 2017.",
