  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt had never been done before.\n\nBut with the words \"You're Go for landing\", \n<a href=\"https://apolloinrealtime.org/11/\">50 years ago</a> \nthis Saturday, Apollo 11 astronauts \n<a href=\"https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/aldrin.htm\">Aldrin</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/bios/neilabio.html\">Armstrong</a> were cleared to make the \n<a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/video11.html\">first try</a>.\n\nThe next few minutes would contain more than a \n<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/apollo-11-plus-45-how-neil-armstrong-saved-day-moon-n160386\">bit of drama</a>, as an unexpected boulder field and an unacceptably sloping crater loomed below. \n\nWith fuel dwindling, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong\">Armstrong</a> \ncoolly rocketed the lander above the lunar surface as \nhe looked for a clear and flat place to land. \n\nWith only seconds of fuel remaining, and with the help of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin\">Aldrin</a> and \n<a href=\"https://spacecenter.org/exhibits-and-experiences/nasa-tram-tour/apollo-mission-control/\">mission control</a> calling out data, \nArmstrong finally found a safe spot -- and put \n<a href=\"https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059C\">the Eagle</a> down. \n\nMany people on Earth listening to the live audio felt great relief on hearing \"The Eagle has landed\", and \n<a href=\"https://news.umich.edu/americans-reflect-on-apollo-11-and-the-space-program/\">great pride</a> knowing that for the first time ever, \nhuman beings were on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a>.\n\nCombined in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc1SzgGhMKc?start=850\">featured descent video</a> are two audio feeds, a video feed similar to \n<a href=\"https://asunow.asu.edu/20190716-flying-final-approach-tranquility-base\">what the astronauts saw</a>, captions of the dialog, \nand data including the tilt of the Eagle lander.\n\nThe video concludes with the \n<a href=\"ap120830.html\">panorama of the lunar landscape</a> visible \n<a href=\"https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/image/ap11_lm_as11_40_5927.jpg\">outside the Eagle</a>.\n\nA few hours later, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_in_popular_culture#Public_reception\">hundreds of millions of people</a> across planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a>, drawn \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1909/\">together</a> as a single species, \nwatched fellow humans walk on the Moon.",
