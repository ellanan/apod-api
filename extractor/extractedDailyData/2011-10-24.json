  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created the Waterfall Nebula?\n\nNo one knows.  \n\nThe structure seen in the region of\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im1086.html\">NGC 1999</a> in the Great  \n<a href=\"ap070125.html\">Orion Molecular Cloud complex</a>\nis one of the more mysterious structures yet found on the sky.\n\nDesignated HH-222, the elongated gaseous stream stretches about ten light years and emits an unusual array of colors.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...427..895C\">One hypothesis</a> is that the gas filament results from the wind from a young star impacting a nearby molecular cloud.\n\nThat would not explain, however, why the\n<a href=\"ap991129.html\">Waterfall</a> and fainter streams all appear to converge on a bright but unusual non thermal radio source located toward the upper left of the curving structure.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...427..895C\">Another hypothesis</a> is that the unusual radio source originates from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary\">binary system</a> containing a hot\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/dwarfs.html\">white dwarf</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star\">neutron star</a>, or\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18007\">black hole</a>, and that the <a href=\"http://beautifulplacestovisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Plitvice-Lake-Croatia.jpg\">Waterfall</a> is just a jet from this energetic system.\n\nSuch systems, though, are typically strong <a href=\"http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/HighSchool/Radiography/discoveryxrays.htm\">X-rays</a> emitters, and no X-rays have been detected.\n\nFor now, this case remains unsolved.  \n\nPerhaps well-chosen\n<a href=\"http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Humor/Cats/Curious.jpg\">future observations</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/a-murder-of-crows/full-episode/5977/\">clever deductive reasoning</a> will unlock the true origin of this enigmatic wisp in the future.",
