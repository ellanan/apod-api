  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Do all galaxies have black holes at their\ncenters?  Although not even a single <a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">galaxy</a>\nhas yet been proven to have a central <a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/abholes.html\">black hole</a>,\nthe list of candidates has increased yet again.  <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/01.html\">Recent results by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nnow indicate that most - and possibly even all - large galaxies\nmay harbor one of these <a href=\"ap961125.html\">dense beasts</a>.\nIn all the galaxies studied, star speeds continue to increase\n<a href=\"ap951001.html\">closer the very center</a>.  This in\nitself indicates a center millions of times more massive than\nour <a href=\"ap970108.html\">Sun</a> is needed to contain the\nstars.  This mass when combined with the limiting size make the\ncase for the central <a href=\"ap970105.html\">black holes</a>.\n <a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v473n2/5455/sc0.html\">Will we ever know for sure?</a>",
