  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat if you're driving down the street and an object from space shoots across the sky right in front of you?  \n\nSuch was the case last week for many people in south central Canada.   \n\nSpecifically, an extremely \n<a href=\"ap990219.html\">bright fireball</a>, \npresumably a desk-sized \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor\">meteor</a> from deep space, \nflashed across the sky just after sunset on 2008 November 20.  \n\nThe bright fireball was recorded on many images and movies, including the spectacular \n<a href=\"http://www.globaltv.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=978054\">video shown above</a> that was captured by a dashboard camera of a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car\">police cruiser</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton\">Edmonton</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta\">Alberta</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>.  \n\nBecause at least two streaks appear to be visible, the falling object likely broke up into pieces as it fell deep into \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/question308.htm\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.\n\nBy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation\">triangulating</a> fireball images from several simultaneously recorded sources, \nastronomers hope to find an approximate orbit from whence \n<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5221569.ece\">the object</a> came, as well as the likely place(s) on Earth where large pieces would have impacted, were they to have survived entry.  \n\nIn the best case scenario, pieces \n<a href=\"http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=62dedb5f-2ef7-4c1f-ade1-516293ac0fd1\">would be recovered</a> \nfrom a known deep space \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">comet</a> or \n<a href=\"ap070422.html\">asteroid</a>, \ngiving humanity an unprecedented look at an \nancient object that likely holds \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ESASP.495..247J\">clues</a> \nto the early years of our Earth and the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/index.cfm\">Solar System</a>.",
