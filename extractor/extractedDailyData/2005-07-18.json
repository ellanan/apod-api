  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was a human-made event visible across the Solar System.  \n\nAt the direction of \n<a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/science/team.html\">terrestrial scientists</a>, a refrigerator-sized probe from the \n<a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Deep Impact</a> \nmission struck \n<a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/science/tempel1.html\">Comet Tempel 1</a> on July 4 at over 35,000 kilometers per hour.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/press/050704a-jpl.html\">unexpectedly bright explosion</a> was not \n<a href=\"http://zvis.com/cpg14/index.php?cat=23\">nuclear</a> \nbut rather originated from a large plume that reflected back sunlight.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/17/\">Pictured above</a> is how the event looked to the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"ap021124.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  \n\nA large cloud of bright material is seen emanating from the \n<a href=\"ap040103.html\">comet's nucleus</a> and then dispersing.  \n\nThe area encompassing the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/deepimpact/tempelcurve2.jpg\">comet became over two times brighter</a> in the hours after the impact.\n\nAstronomers will continue to study the images and data returned by \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/deepimpact/\">Deep Impact</a> \nto better determine the nature of \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/deepimpact/tempel1.html\">Comet Tempel 1</a> and discern clues about the formation dynamics of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/origin.html\">early Solar System</a>.",
