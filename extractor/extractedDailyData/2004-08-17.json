  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy aren't these Martian rocks round?  \n\nSmall rocks dubbed \n<a href=\"ap040405.html\">blueberries</a> have been found by the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html\">Opportunity rover</a> all over \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/22jan_meridianiplanum.htm\">Meridiani Planum</a> on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>, \nbut the ones perched on Bylot rock have unusually non-spherical shapes.  \n\nThe strangely shaped blueberry rocks are \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=760\">shown above</a> in an  image taken by Opportunity's \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_instru_mi.html\">microscopic imager</a> on August 9. \n\nDark sand also covers much of \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06762\">Bylot rock</a>.  \n\nOne hypothesis for the lack of \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/earth_blueberries_too.html\">blueberry roundness</a> here is a coating relatively resistant to erosion.  \n\nThe average diameter of a \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/hematite_blueberries_040319.html\">blueberry</a> is about 4 millimeters.  \n\nThe study of these and other \n<a href=\"ap040310.html\">rock features</a> \nis allowing a better understanding of the \n<a href=\"ap040303.html\">wet past</a> of ancient Mars.",
