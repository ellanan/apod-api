  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's more rare than a supermoon total lunar eclipse?\n\nHow about a supermoon total lunar eclipse over a lightning storm.\n\nSuch an electrifying sequence was captured yesterday from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza\">Ibiza</a>, an island in southeastern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nAfter planning the location for beauty, and the timing to capture the entire eclipse sequence, \nthe only thing that had to cooperate for this astrophotographer to capture a \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NASA/app_723403517771551\">memorable eclipse sequence</a> \nwas the weather.\n\nWhat looked to be a \n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/catcountry1073.com/files/2013/02/CAT.jpg\">bother</a> on the\n<a href=\"ap110618.html\">horizon</a>, though, turned out to be a \n<a href=\"http://www.neboagency.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/happydog.jpg\">blessing</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/123250511/blood-moon-by-jose-antonio-hervas\">composite picture</a> features over \n200 digitally combined images from the same location over the course of a night.\n\nThe full moon is seen setting as it \n<a href=\"ap141005.html\">faded</a> to \n<a href=\"ap140418.html\">red</a> in Earth's shadow and then returned to normal. \n\nThe fortuitous lightning is seen reflected in the Mediterranean to the right of the 400-meter tall rocky island of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Es_Vedr%C3%A0\">Es Vedra</a>.\n\nAlthough the next total eclipse of a large and bright supermoon will occur in 2033, the \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEdecade/LEdecade2011.html\">next total eclipse</a> \nof any full moon will occur in January 2018 and be best \n<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2018-january-31\">visible</a> from eastern Asia and Australia.",
