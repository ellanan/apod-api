  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIn the shadow of Saturn, unexpected wonders appear.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEM9D2HHZTD_0.html\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"saturn.html\">Saturn</a> drifted in giant planet's \n<a href=\"ap040926.html\">shadow</a> earlier this year and looked\nback toward the \n<a href=\"ap010408.html\">eclipsed Sun</a>.  \n\nCassini saw a unique and celebrated \n<a href=\"ap110613.html\">view</a>.  \n\nFirst, the \n<a href=\"ap060912.html\">night side of Saturn</a> \nis seen to be partly lit by light reflected from its own \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">majestic ring system</a>. \n\nNext, Saturn's expansive ring system appears as \nmajestic as always even from this odd angle.\n\nRing particles, many glowing only as irregular crescents, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_scatter\">slightly scatter</a> sunlight toward Cassini in this \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17172\">natural color image</a>.\n\nSeveral \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/figures/PIA17172_fig3.jpg\">moons and ring features</a> are also discernible. \n\nAppearing quite prominently is Saturn's \n<a href=\"ap070327.html\">E ring</a>, the ring created by the unusual  \n<a href=\"ap051205.html\">ice-fountains</a> of the moon \n<a href=\"ap050906.html\">Enceladus</a> and the outermost ring visible above.  \n\nTo the upper left, far in the distance, are the planets Mars and Venus.\n\nTo the lower right, however, is perhaps the most wondrous spectacle of all:\nthe almost invisible, nearly ignorable,   \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot\">pale blue dot</a>\nof Earth.",
