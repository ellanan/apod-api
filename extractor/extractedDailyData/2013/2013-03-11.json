  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does a volcanic eruption sometimes create lightning?\n\nPictured above, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakurajima\">Sakurajima volcano</a>\nin southern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>\nwas caught erupting in early January.\n\n<a href=\"ap051002.html\">Magma bubbles</a> so hot they\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescence\">glow</a> shoot away as liquid rock \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_eruption\">bursts</a> \nthrough the Earth's surface from below.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.mrietze.com/web13/japan13.htm\">above image</a> \nis particularly notable, however, for the lightning bolts caught near the volcano's summit.  \n\nWhy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning\">lightning</a>\noccurs even in common thunderstorms remains a topic of research, and the cause of\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gW-Txy8pmc\">volcanic lightning</a> \nis even less clear.\n\nSurely,\n<a href=\"ap080705.html\">lightning bolts</a>\nhelp quench areas of opposite but separated electric charges.\n\nOne <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/augustine.html\">hypothesis holds</a> that catapulting magma bubbles or volcanic ash are themselves electrically charged, and by their motion create these separated areas.\n\nOther <a href=\"http://geology.com/articles/volcanic-lightning/\">volcanic lightning</a> episodes may be facilitated by\ncharge-inducing collisions in volcanic dust.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/how-often-does-lightning-strike.htm\">Lightning</a> is usually occurring somewhere on Earth, typically over 40 times each second.",
