  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you saw your shadow on Mars and it wasn't human?\n\nThen you might be the robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_Rover\">Curiosity</a> \nrover currently \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test\">exploring Mars</a>.\n\nCuriosity landed in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale_crater\">Gale Crater</a> last August and has been busy looking for signs of ancient running water and clues that Mars could once have harbored life.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16563\">Pictured above</a>, \nCuriosity has taken a wide panorama that includes its own shadow in the direction opposite the Sun.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16563\">The image</a> \nwas taken in November from a location dubbed Point Lake, although no water presently exists there.\n\nCuriosity has already discovered several indications of \n<a href=\"ap121002.html\">dried streambeds</a> on Mars, and is scheduled to continue its exploration by climbing nearby \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolis_Mons\">Mt. Sharp</a> over the next few years.",
