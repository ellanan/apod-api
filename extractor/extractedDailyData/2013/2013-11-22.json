  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAn astronomical trip from the California Nebula to the Pleiades\nstar cluster would cover just over 12 degrees across planet Earth's night sky.\n\nThat's equivalent to the\n<a href=\"ap130801.html\">angular extent</a> of 25 Full Moons,\nas your telescope sweeps past the borders of the\nconstellations Perseus and Taurus.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?\nfbid=596870153713635&amp;set=a.511542708913047.1073741828.511507152249936&amp;\ntype=1&amp;theater\">This wide and deep mosaic image</a>\nof the region explores the\ncosmic landscape's dusty nebulae and colors\n<a href=\"ap090411.html\">otherwise too faint</a>\nfor your eye to see.\n\nOn the left, cataloged as NGC 1499, the\n<a href=\"ap080307.html\">California Nebula</a> does\nhave a familiar shape, though its coastline is actually over\n60 light-years long and lies about 1,500 light-years\naway.\n\nThe nebula's pronounced reddish glow is from hydrogen atoms ionized\nby luminous blue star Xi Persei seen just to its right.\n\nAt the far right, the famous\n<a href=\"ap031227.html\">Pleiades star cluster</a> is some\n400 light-years distant and around 15 light-years across.\n\nIts spectacular blue color is due to the reflection of starlight\nby interstellar dust.\n\nIn between are hot stars of the Perseus OB2\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nStellar_association#Stellar_associations\">association</a> and\ndusty, dark nebulae along the edge of the nearby, massive\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_molecular_cloud\">Perseus\nmolecular cloud</a>.",
