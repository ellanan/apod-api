  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nUsing a small telescope to scan the skies on August 14,\nJapanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki\n<a href=\"http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/\nJ20233073+2046041.html\">discovered a \"new\" star</a>\nwithin the boundaries of the constellation Delphinus.\n\nIndicated in this skyview captured on August 15 from Stagecoach,\nColorado, it is now appropriately designated Nova Delphini 2013.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sge/index.html\">Sagitta</a>,\nthe Arrow, points the way to the\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/\nBright-Nova-in-Delphinus-219631281.html\">newcomer's location</a>\nhigh in the evening sky, not far from bright star Altair\nand the asterism known to\nnorthern hemisphere skygazers as the Summer Triangle.\n\nThe nova is reported to be easy\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/104103/\nbright-new-nova-in-delphinus-you-can-see-it-tonight-with-binoculars/\">to\nspot with binoculars</a>, near the limit of naked-eye visibility\nunder dark skies.\n\nIn fact, previous deep sky charts do show a much fainter\nknown star (about 17th\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nMagnitude_%28astronomy%29\">magnitude</a>) at the position of Nova Delphini,\nindicating this star's apparent brightness suddenly\nincreased over 25,000 times.\n\nHow does a star undergo such a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nCataclysmic_variable_star\">cataclysmic</a> change?\n\nThe spectrum\n<a href=\"http://www.virtualtelescope.eu/tag/\npnv-j202330732046041/\">of Nova Delphini</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=5282\">indicates</a> it\nis a classical nova, an interacting binary star system in which one star\nis a dense, hot\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf\">white dwarf.</a>\n\nMaterial from a cool, giant companion star\nfalls onto the surface of the white dwarf,\nbuilding up until it triggers a thermonuclear event.\n\nThe drastic increase in brightness and an expanding shell\nof debris is the result - but\n<a href=\"ap091117.html\">the stars are not destroyed</a>!\n\nClassical novae are\nbelieved to recur when the flow of material onto the white dwarf\nresumes and produces another outburst.",
