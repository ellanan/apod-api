  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA gaze across a cosmic skyscape, this telescopic mosaic reveals the\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/ansel/filmmore/fd.html\">continuous\nbeauty of things that are</a>.\n\nThe evocative scene spans some 6 degrees or 12 Full Moons in\n<a href=\"ap090411.html\">planet Earth's sky</a>.\n\nAt the left, folds of red, glowing gas are\na small part of an immense, 300 light-year wide arc.\n\nKnown as <a href=\"ap090224.html\">Barnard's loop</a>,\nthe structure is too faint to be seen with the eye,\nshaped by long gone supernova explosions and\nthe winds from massive stars, and\nstill traced by the light of hydrogen atoms.\n\nBarnard's loop lies about 1,500 light-years away\n<a href=\"ap101023.html\">roughly centered on the Great Orion Nebula</a>,\na stellar nursery along the edge of Orion's molecular clouds.\n\nBut beyond lie other fertile star fields in the plane of our\nMilky Way Galaxy.\n\nAt the right, the long-exposure composite finds\n<a href=\"ap130114.html\">NGC 2170, a dusty complex</a> of nebulae\nnear a neighboring\nmolecular cloud some 2,400 light-years distant.",
