  "title": "Circling a Black Hole at its Photon Sphere",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to go right up to a black hole?\n\nOne particularly interesting place near a black hole is its \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere\">photon sphere</a>, \nwhere photons can orbit in circles, a sphere 50 percent further out than the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon\">event horizon</a>.\n\nWere you to look out from the \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/blkhol.html#c3\">photon sphere</a> of a \n<a href=\"ap130701.html\">black hole</a>, half of the sky would\nappear completely black, half of the sky would appear unusually bright, \nand the back of your head would appear across the middle.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SqoQ60-c8\">above computer-animated video</a> depicts \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N\">this view</a> from the photon sphere.\n\nThe reason that the lower region, as shown, \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21664\">appears black</a> is because all light paths from this dark region comes up from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole\">black hole</a> -- \nwhich classically emits no light.\n\nThe upper half of the sky now appears unusually bright, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift\">blueshifted</a>, \nand shows increasingly many complete sky images increasingly \nclose to the dark-light divide across the middle. \n\nThat dark-light divide is the \n<a href=\"http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/singularity.html#photon\">photon sphere</a> -- \nyour location -- and since photons can do circles there, \nlight from the back of your head can circle the \n<a href=\"http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/BHfaq.html\">black hole</a> \nand come to your eye.\n\nNo place on \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/nslens_bh.html\">the sky</a> \nis hidden from you -- stars that would normally pass behind the black hole \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/pscirc.html\">now appear</a> \nto zip quickly around an \n<a href=\"ap080728.html\">Einstein ring</a>, a ring that \nappears above as a horizontal line about a quarter of the way down from the video top.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SqoQ60-c8\">above video</a> is part of a\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">sequence of videos</a>\nvisually \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ascl.soft10006N\">exploring</a> \nthe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N2lZj7Ttnk\">space near</a> \na black hole's\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/BlackHoleAnat.html\">event horizon</a>. \n\n<i>(Disclosure: Video creator Robert Nemiroff is an editor for APOD.)</i>",
