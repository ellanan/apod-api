  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950616.html\">first APOD</a> appeared eighteen years ago today, on 1995 June 16.  \n\nAlthough garnering only 14 pageviews on that day,\n<a href=\"ap050616.html\">we</a> are proud to estimate that\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APOD\">APOD</a> has now\nserved over one <i>billion</i> space-related images over the past eighteen years.  \n\nThat early beginning, along with a nearly unchanging format, has allowed APOD to be a consistent and familiar site on a web frequently filled with change.   \n\nMany people don't know, though, that APOD is now\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">translated daily</a> into many major languages.\n\nWe again thank our readers, astrophotographers, and\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>\nfor their continued support, but ask that any\npotentially congratulatory e-mail go this year to the volunteers all around the world who translate\n<a href=\"http://www.capjournal.org/issues/08/08_22.pdf\">APOD</a>'s captions daily, many times with considerable effort.\n\nSome <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5yqorEHDaA\">APOD</a> images are featured in the above spectacular collage visualizing <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19edw2/i_am_a_robert_nemiroff_from_nasas_astronomy/\">APOD</a> as a classic film reel, submitted by an\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap_faq.html\">APOD</a> enthusiast skilled in digital image manipulation. \n\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/discuss_apod.php?date=130616\">How many</a> APOD images can you identify?",
