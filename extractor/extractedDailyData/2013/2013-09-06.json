  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHot gas is hard to swallow.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/sgra_gas/\">At least\nthat seems to be true</a> for the supermassive black hole\n<a href=\"ap081211.html\">at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nKnown as source <a href=\"ap121102.html\">Sagittarius A*</a>,\nthe Milky Way's black hole is\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/13_releases/press_082913.html\">\ncentered in this</a> infrared (red and yellow hues) and X-ray (blue)\ncomposite.\n\nBased on data from an\n<a href=\"http://www.sgra-star.com/\">extensive campaign</a>\nof observations by the orbiting Chandra X-ray telescope, the diffuse\nemission surrounding the black hole is seen in the close-up inset,\nthe inset field spanning about 1/2 light-year across the galactic center some\n26,000 light-years away.\n\nAstronomers have found that the X-ray emission originates in hot gas\ndrawn from the winds of massive young stars in the region.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5845\">The Chandra data</a>\nindicate that only about 1% or less of the gas within the\nblack hole's gravitational influence ever reaches the event horizon,\nlosing enough heat and angular momentum to fall into the black hole,\nwhile the rest of the gas escapes in an outflow.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/blog/node/452\">The result explains</a>\nwhy the Milky Way's black hole is so quiet,\nmuch fainter than might be\n<a href=\"ap020309.html\">expected</a> in energetic X-rays.\n\nIt likely holds for most supermassive black holes\nin galaxies in the nearby Universe.",
