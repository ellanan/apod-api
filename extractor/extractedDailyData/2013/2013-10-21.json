  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis image of Saturn could not have been taken from Earth. \n\nNo <a href=\"ap000701.html\">Earth</a> based picture could possibly view the night side of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a> and the corresponding \n<a href=\"ap061016.html\">shadow</a> cast across Saturn's rings. \n\nSince Earth is much closer to the Sun than \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2013/10161711-saturn-mosaic-gordan.html\">Saturn</a>, only the day side of the \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/10/17/cassini_s_saturn_incredible_mosaic_by_gordon_ugarkovic.html\">ringed planet</a> is visible from the \n<a href=\"ap130723.html\">Earth</a>. \n\nIn fact, \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/saturn/saturn-within-its-rings.html\">this image mosaic</a> was taken earlier this month by the robotic \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn.   \n\nThe beautiful rings of Saturn are seen in full expanse, while \n<a href=\"ap051010.html\">cloud details</a> are visible including the \n<a href=\"ap130220.html\">polar hexagon</a> surrounding the north pole, and an \n<a href=\"ap110119.html\">extended light-colored storm</a> system.",
