  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nHow impressive will Comet ISON become?\n\nNo one is sure, but unfortunately, as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_ISON\">the comet</a> \napproaches the inner Solar System, it is \n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2012S1/2012S1.html\">brightening\nmore slowly</a> than many early predictions.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.damianpeach.com/deepsky/\nc2012_s1_2013_09_24rgb.jpg\">Pictured above</a>, Comet ISON is\nseen about two weeks ago as it continued to develop a tail.\n\nLast week the comet passed relatively close to Mars, and was \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2013/\nmars-reconnaissance-orbiter.html\">directly imaged</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter</a>. \n\nWhen <a href=\"http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~apod/apod/ap121001.html\">Comet\nISON</a> dives to within a few solar radii of the Sun's surface\nin late November, it \n<a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nreturnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK12S010\">may become brighter</a>\nthan the Moon and sport a long and\nflowing tail -- or it may appear somewhat less spectacular.\n\nEither way, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky\">sky</a> \nenthusiasts hope that whatever comet parts survive will put on quite an\nimpressive show, as viewed from Earth, through at least the rest of the year.",
