  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe universe is\n<a href=\"ap121014.html\">filled with galaxies</a>.\n\nBut to see them astronomers must look out\n<a href=\"ap061005.html\">beyond the stars</a> of\nour own galaxy, <a href=\"ap130601.html\">the Milky Way</a>.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1108a/\">colorful\nHubble Space Telescopic portrait</a> features\nspiral galaxy NGC 6384, about 80 million light-years\naway in the direction of the constellation \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus\">Ophiuchus</a>.\n\nAt that distance, NGC 6384 spans an estimated 150,000 light-years,\nwhile the Hubble close-up of the galaxy's central region is about\n70,000 light-years wide.\n\nThe sharp image shows details in the distant galaxy's blue\nstar clusters and dust lanes along magnificent spiral arms,\nand a bright core dominated by yellowish starlight.\n\nStill, the individual stars seen in the picture\nare all in the relatively close foreground, well\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">within our own\ngalaxy</a>.\n\nThe brighter Milky Way stars show noticeable crosses, or\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike\">diffraction\nspikes</a>, caused by the telescope itself.",
