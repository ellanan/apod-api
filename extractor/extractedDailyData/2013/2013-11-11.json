  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes, a total eclipse of the Sun is an opportunity.\n\nTaking advantage of such, the above image shows the \n<a href=\"ap131104.html\">solar eclipse earlier this month</a> \nas covered and uncovered by several different solar observatories.\n\nThe innermost image shows the Sun in \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html\">ultraviolet light</a> as recorded over a few hours by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAP_(instrument)\">SWAP instrument</a> aboard the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proba-2\">PROBA2</a> mission in a \n<a href=\"http://marine.rutgers.edu/mrs/education/class/paul/orbits2.html\">sun-synchronous</a> low Earth orbit.\n\nThis image is surrounded by a ground-based eclipse image, reproduced\nin blue,  taken from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon\">Gabon</a>.\n\nFurther out is a circularly blocked region used to artificially dim the central sun by the \n<a href=\"http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/\">LASCO</a> instrument aboard the Sun-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/\">SOHO</a> spacecraft.\n\nThe outermost image -- showing the outflowing \n<a href=\"ap090726.html\">solar corona</a> -- was taken by LASCO ten minutes after the eclipse and shows an outflowing solar corona.\n\nOver the past few weeks, our Sun has been showing an \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/106278/solar-activity-ramps-up-as-giant-sunspot-group-turns-to-face-earth/\">unusually high</a> \namount of \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/sunspots/\">sunspots</a>, \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml\">CMEs</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/flare.htm\">flares</a> -- activity that was generally expected as the Sun is currently going through \n<a href=\"http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2013/solarmax/\">Solar Maximum</a> -- the busiest part of its 11 year \n<a href=\"ap071203.html\">solar cycle</a>.\n\nThe above resultant image is a picturesque montage of many <a href=\"http://fusedweb.llnl.gov/cpep/chart_pages/5.plasmas/sunlayers.html\">solar layers</a> at once that allows \n<a href=\"http://www.soundandvision.com/images/100426-audience.jpg\">solar astronomers</a> to better match up active areas on or near the Sun's surface with \n<a href=\"ap111005.html\">outflowing jets</a> in the Sun's corona.",
