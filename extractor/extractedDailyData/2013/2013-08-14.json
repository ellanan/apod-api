  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt took three worlds to create this simple image.\n\nThe first world was the \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>, which was quite prominent.\nThe dividing line running horizontally below the middle separates sea from sky. \nOn this part of the Earth, it was almost nighttime.\n\nThe second world was the \n<a href=\"ap120324.html\">Moon</a>, which was almost invisible.\nThe Moon had its unilluminated half masked by the red sunset glow of Earth's sky. \nA thin sliver of the new Moon was visible, a crescent that traces the bright curving line.\n\nThe third world was the \n<a href=\"ap111115.html\">Sun</a>, which does not appear directly. \nAll of the light recorded in the image originated from the Sun.\n\nThe above half-second exposure was taken last week from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anping_District\">Anping</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan\">Taiwan</a>.\n\nA few minutes after \n<a href=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/1085054_518410821564148_994437917_o.jpg\">this image</a> was taken the Earth had spun just a little bit further -- forcing the \n<a href=\"ap050513.html\">Moon</a> to follow the \n<a href=\"ap070605.html\">Sun</a> into the sea -- and the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Horizon\">horizon</a> to become dark.",
