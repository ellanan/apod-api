  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat caused the interestingly intricate tails that Comet Lemmon displayed earlier this year?\n\nFirst of all, just about every comet that nears the Sun displays two tails: a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comet_Parts.jpg\">dust tail</a> and an \n<a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Lemmon\">Comet Lemmon</a>'s \ndust tail, visible above and around the comet nucleus in off-white, \nis produced by sun-light reflecting \n<a href=\"ap010813.html\">dust</a> shed by the \n<a href=\"ap101123.html\">comet's heated nucleus</a>. \n\nFlowing and more sculptured, however, is \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=30841\">C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)</a>'s blue \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion\">ion</a> tail, created by the \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">solar wind</a> pushing ions expelled by the nucleus away from the Sun.\n\nAlso of note is the coma seen surrounding \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/101137/comet-lemmon-a-preview-guide-for-april/\">Comet Lemmon</a>'s nucleus, \n<a href=\"ap130207.html\">tinted green</a> by diatomic C2 gas fluorescing in sunlight.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astrostudio.at/2_Bright%20Comets.php?img=images/2_Bright%20Comets/146_Lemmoncolor_21_04.jpg\">above image</a> \nwas taken from the dark skies of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia\">Namibia</a> in mid-April. \n\nComet Lemmon is fading as it now \n<a href=\"http://mpcapp1.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK12F060\">heads back</a> to the outer Solar System.",
