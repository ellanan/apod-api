  "title": "Large Sunspots Now Crossing the Sun",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne of the largest sunspot regions in recent years is now crossing the Sun.\n\nThis region of convoluted magnetic fields may well produce a \n<a href=\"ap130413.html\">solar flare</a> that releases a cloud of energetic particles \ninto the Solar System.\n\nWere a very powerful cloud to impact the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere/\">Earth's magnetosphere</a>, it could be dangerous to Earth-orbiting astronauts and satellites. \n\nConversely, the impact of even a less energetic cloud might create \n<a href=\"ap130326.html\">picturesque aurora</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.damianpeach.com/solar13/ar1785_2013_07_06dp.jpg\">Pictured above</a> \nis the sunspot region as it appeared two days ago.\n\nThe rightmost part of this region has been cataloged as \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXgrJxFzGhw\">AR 11785</a>, while the left part as \n<a href=\" http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HdqmAW2NSkE/Udw29hF34vI/AAAAAAAAIwg/9Czv2Ni9Mbc/s1600/Full+Disc+White+light+060713+data.png\">AR 11787</a>.\n\nThe darkest <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot\">sunspot</a> regions contain nearly vertical magnetic fields and are called umbras, while the surrounding bronze regions -- more clearly showing stringy <a href=\"ap101102.html\">magnetic flux tubes</a> -- are called penumbras.\n\n<a href=\"ap111106.html\">Churning solar granules</a>, many about 1000 km across, \ncompose the yellow background region. \n\nNo one knows what this sunspot region will do, but space weather researchers are \n<a href=\"http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/images/\">monitoring it</a> closely.",
