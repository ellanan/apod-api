  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhile most spiral galaxies, including our\n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">own Milky Way</a>,\nhave two or more spiral arms, NGC 4725 has only one.\n\nIn this <a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/\nNGC4725-Subaru-HST.html\">sharp color composite image</a>,\nthe solo <a href=\"ap080517.html\">spira mirabilis</a> seems to wind\nfrom a prominent ring of bluish, newborn star clusters and red\ntinted star forming regions.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/\n2355-sig05-011-NGC-4725\">The odd galaxy also</a> sports obscuring\ndust lanes a yellowish central bar structure\ncomposed of an older population of stars.\n\nNGC 4725 is over 100 thousand light-years across and lies 41 million\nlight-years away in the well-groomed constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/com/index.html\">Coma\nBerenices</a>.\n\nComputer\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9705078\">simulations</a>\nof the formation of single spiral\narms suggest that they can be either leading or trailing\narms with respect to a galaxy's\n<a href=\"ap040221.html\">overall rotation</a>.\n\nAlso included in the frame, a more traditional looking spiral\nappears as a smaller background galaxy.",
