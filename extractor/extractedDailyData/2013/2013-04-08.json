  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow far away is \"redshift six\"?\n\nAlthough humans are inherently familiar with \n<a href=\"ap080801.html\">distance</a> and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory\">time</a>, \nwhat is actually measured for astronomical objects is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift\">redshift</a>, \na color displacement that depends on exactly how energy density has evolved in our universe.\n\nNow since cosmological measurements in recent years have led to a \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/concordance+model\">concordance</a> on what \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N\">energy forms</a> \npervade our universe, it is now possible to make a simple table relating observed \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_redshift#Redshift_velocity_and_recessional_velocity\">cosmological redshift</a>, labeled \"z\", with standard concepts of distance and time, including the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html\">extrapolated time</a> \nsince the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang\">universe began</a>.\n\nOne such table is \n<a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/513026/the-paper-and-pencil-cosmological-calculator/\">listed above</a>, where redshift z is listed in the first and last columns, \nwhile the corresponding universe age in billions of years is listed in the central column.\n\nTo find the meaning of the rest of the columns, please read the \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5961\">accompanying technical paper</a>.\n\nAlthough stars in our galaxy are effectively at \n<a href=\"http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/help/zdef.html\">cosmological redshift</a> zero, \nthe most distant \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHjTb8Chq3k\">supernova</a>e \nseen occur out \n<a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/space/galaxies/hubble-spots-the-most-distant-supernova-ever-130405.htm\">past redshift one</a>, \nwhich the above chart shows occurred when the universe was approximately half its present age.\n\nBy contrast, the most distant \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfDDI_SCarw\">gamma-ray bursts</a> yet observed occur out \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gamma-ray_bursts#Extremes\">past redshift six</a>, occurring when the universe was younger than one billion years old, \nless than 10 percent of its present age.",
