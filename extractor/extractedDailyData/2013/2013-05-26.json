  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nAs planet Earth approached the plane of the\nComet PanSTARRS (C/2011 L4) orbit on May 23rd, comet watchers were\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/43846774@N02/8806779876/\">treated\nto this view</a> of its\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/102299/\nwhat-do-comet-panstarrs-and-pinocchio-have-in-common/\">magnificent\nanti-tail</a>.\n\nThe long, <a href=\"ap130518.html\">narrow anti-tail stretches</a>\nto the right across this frame for nearly 4 degrees\nor about 8 times the angular size of the full Moon.\n\nDust forming the anti-tail trails along the comet's orbit as it\nleaves the inner solar system behind.\n\nAn almost edge-on perspective from near the outbound\n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?\nsstr=C%2F2011%20L4;orb=1;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#orb\">comet's orbital plane</a>\nenhances the view of the anti-tail and\nmakes it seem to point in the sunward direction,\nonly apparently contrary to the\n<a href=\"ap130330.html\">behavior of comet dust tails</a>\npushed outward by the pressure of sunlight.\n\n<a href=\"ap130405.html\">Sweeping far north</a> in planet Earth's skies,\nthe comet is up all night for most of the northern hemisphere,\nbut now bright moonlight interferes with its visibility.\n\nPanSTARRS anti-tail is one of the longest since the appearance of\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/1956r1.html\">Comet Arend-Roland</a>\nin 1957.",
