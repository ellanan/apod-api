  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat creates these long and nearly straight grooves on Mars?\n\nDubbed \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17260\">linear gullies</a>, they appear on the sides of some sandy slopes during Martian spring, have nearly constant width, extend for as long as two kilometers, and have raised banks along their sides.\n\nUnlike most water flows, they do not appear to have areas of dried debris at the downhill end.\n\nA leading hypothesis -- actually \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNXBfz1iVzc\">being tested</a> here on Earth -- is that these linear gullies are caused by chunks of carbon dioxide ice \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_ice\">dry ice</a>) \nbreaking off and sliding down hills while \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)\">sublimating</a> into gas, eventually completely evaporating into thin air.\n\nIf true, these natural \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76CNkxizQuc\">dry-ice</a> sleds may well provide \n<a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/82/249729539_8ece634ed4.jpg\">future adventurers</a> a smooth ride on cushions of escaping carbon dioxide.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-200\">above recently-released image</a> was taken in 2006 by the \n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/\">HiRISE</a> camera on board the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> currently orbiting Mars.",
