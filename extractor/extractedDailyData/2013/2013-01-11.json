  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow do clusters of galaxies form and evolve?\n\nTo help find out, astronomers continue to study the second closest cluster of galaxies to Earth: the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax_cluster\">Fornax cluster</a>, named for the southern \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax\">constellation</a>\ntoward which most of its galaxies can be found.\n\nAlthough almost 20 times more distant than our\n<a href=\"ap090510.html\">neighboring Andromeda</a> galaxy,\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.428..834D\">Fornax</a> is only about 10 percent further that the better known and more populated <a href=\"ap110422.html\">Virgo cluster</a> of galaxies.\n\nFornax has a well-defined central region that contains many galaxies,\nbut is still evolving.\n\nIt has other\n<a href=\"ap070319.html\">galaxy group</a>ings that appear distinct\nand have yet to merge.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.glitteringlights.com/Images/deepsky/\n13667287_7Mtr58#!i=2205976441\">Seen here</a>, almost every\nyellowish splotch on the image is an elliptical galaxy in the \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/for.html\">Fornax cluster</a>.\n\nThe picturesque barred spiral galaxy\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121124.html\">NGC 1365</a> visible on the lower right is also a prominent Fornax cluster member.",
