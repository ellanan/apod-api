  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the sky above can become quite a show.\n\nIn early September of 2010, for example, the \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=21078\">Moon and Venus converged</a>, creating quite a \n<a href=\"ap100516.html\">sight</a> by itself for \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> around the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5DqY_q86xQ\">globe</a>. �\n\nFrom some locations, though, the sky was even more picturesque.\n\nIn the above image taken in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, a crescent Moon and the planet Venus, on the far right, \nwere captured during sunset posing against a deep blue sky. �\n\nIn the foreground, dark \n<a href=\"ap080122.html\">storm cloud</a>s loom across the image bottom, \nwhile a white <a href=\"ap040218.html\">anvil cloud</a> shape appears above.\n\nBlack specks dot the frame, caused by a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81wFZavdhPU\">flock of birds</a> taking flight.\n\nVery soon after this picture was taken, however, the birds passed by, the storm ended, and Venus and the Moon set. �\n\nBright Venus again <a href=\"http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/Sky%20this%20Month/2013/03/Bright%20planets%20meet%20at%20dusk.aspx\">becomes visible</a> just after sunset this 2013 May and will appear near Jupiter toward the end of the month.",
