  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo you see it?  \n\nThis common question frequently precedes the rediscovery of one of the most commonly recognized configurations of stars on the northern sky: the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dipper\">Big Dipper</a>.  \n\nThis grouping of stars is one of the few things that has likely been seen, and will be seen, by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation\">every generation</a>.   \n\nThe Big Dipper is not by itself a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#History_of_the_constellations\">constellation</a>.  \n\nAlthough part of the constellation of the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Ursa_Major.html\">Great Bear</a> (Ursa Major), the \n<a href=\"ap050218.html\">Big Dipper</a> is an \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Const/asterism.html\">asterism</a> \nthat has been known by different names to different societies.\n\nFive of the \n<a href=\"http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99237.htm\">Big Dipper stars</a> are actually near each other in \nspace and were likely formed at nearly the same time.  \n\nConnecting two stars in the far part of the Big Dipper will lead one to \n<a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a>, the North Star, which is part of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Dipper\">Little Dipper</a>.   \n\nRelative stellar motions will cause the \n<a href=\"http://www.dustbunny.com/afk/constellations/bigdipper/\">Big Dipper</a> to slowly change its \n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOW_DIG/038.HTM\">apparent \nconfiguration</a> over the next 100,000 years.",
