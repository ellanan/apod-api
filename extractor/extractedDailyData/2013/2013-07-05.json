  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSome 13,000 light-years away toward the southern constellation Pavo,\nthe globular star cluster NGC 6752\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/milkyway/\ncomponents.html\">roams the halo</a> of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nOver 10 billion years old,\n<a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/spider/MWGC/n6752.html\">NGC 6752</a>\nfollows clusters\n<a href=\"ap110615.html\">Omega Centauri</a> and\n<a href=\"ap110116.html\">47 Tucanae</a> as the third\nbrightest globular in planet Earth's night sky.\n\nIt holds over 100 thousand\n<a href=\"http://astroanarchy.blogspot.com/2010/07/\nngc-6752-as-stereo-pair-3d.html\">stars in a sphere</a>\nabout 100 light-years in diameter.\n\nTelescopic\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...474..701R\">explorations</a>\nof the NGC 6752 have found that\na remarkable fraction of the stars near the cluster's core,\nare multiple star systems.\n\nThey also reveal the presence of blue straggle stars,\nstars which appear to be too young and massive to exist\nin a cluster whose stars are all expected\nto be at least twice as old as the Sun.\n\nThe blue stragglers are\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409001\">thought to be</a>\nformed by star mergers and collisions in the dense\nstellar environment at\n<a href=\"ap120210.html\">the cluster's core</a>.\n\nThis sharp color composite also features the cluster's ancient red\ngiant stars in yellowish hues.",
