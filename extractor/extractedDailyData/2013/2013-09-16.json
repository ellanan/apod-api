  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this.\n\nThat's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33_tUHDkMY\">only one side</a>. \n\nGiven modern digital technology, however, combined with many detailed images returned by the \n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO), a high resolution virtual \n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/790-A-Unique-View-Of-The-Moon.html\">Moon rotation movie</a> has now been composed.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUNB6CMnE8\">above time-lapse video</a> \nstarts with the standard Earth \n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/moon/\">view of the Moon</a>.\n\nQuickly, though, \n<a href=\"ap110312.html\">Mare Orientale</a>, a large crater with a dark center \nthat is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator.  \n\nFrom an entire \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/19699/does-the-moon-rotate/\">lunar month</a> condensed into 24 seconds, \nthe video clearly shows that the Earth side of the Moon contains an abundance of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maria_on_the_Moon\">dark lunar maria</a>, \nwhile the lunar far side is dominated by bright \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_surface.html\">lunar highlands</a>.\n\nTwo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_and_future_lunar_missions\">new missions</a> are scheduled to begin exploring the Moon within the year, \nthe first of which is NASA's \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ladee/main/index.html\">Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer</a> (LADEE).\n\nLADEE, which <a href=\"ap130911.html\">launched</a> just over a week ago, \nis scheduled to begin orbiting the Moon in October \nand will explore the thin and unusual \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/news/lunar-atmosphere.html\">atmosphere of the Moon</a>.\n\nIn a few months, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">Chinese</a>  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_3\">Chang'e 3</a> is scheduled to launch, \na mission that includes a soft lander that will dispatch a robotic rover.",
