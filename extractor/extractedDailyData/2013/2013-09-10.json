  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMight this distant planet hold water?\n\nActually, given how close \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_1214_b\">Gliese 1214b</a> is to its parent star, any water, if it exists, would surely be in the form of steam.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1047b/\">above artist's illustration</a>, the super-Earth Gliese 1214b is imagined passing in front of its parent star, creating a mini-eclipse that alerted humanity to its presence.\n\nGliese 1214b, also designated \n<a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkczfVmObac\">GJ 1214b</a>, has been designated a \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/\">super-Earth</a> because it is larger than the Earth but smaller a planet like \n<a href=\"ap100808.html\">Neptune</a>.\n\nThe entire Gliese 1214 planetary system is of the closest known systems to our Sun, located only 42 light years away.\n\nThe parent star, Gliese 1214 is a slightly smaller and \n<a href=\"http://www.globalanimal.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dog-with-sunglasses.jpg\">cooler version</a> of our Sun.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.naoj.org/Pressrelease/2013/09/03/index.html\">Recent observations</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap990201.html\">Subaru telescope</a> in Hawaii found very little \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html\">scattering of blue light</a> from the parent star by the planet.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.naoj.org/Pressrelease/2013/09/03/index.html#2\">This appears</a> \nmost consistent with a planet that has a watery atmosphere -- although it is \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773..144N\">still possible</a> that the super-Earth has clouds so thick that little of any color of light was scattered.\n\nDetecting water on \n<a href=\"http://exoplanets.org/\">exoplanets</a> is important partly because most lifeforms on Earth need <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/water-vital-to-life.htm\">water to survive</a>.",
