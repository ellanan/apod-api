  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis intriguing trio of galaxies is sometimes\ncalled the Draco Group, located in the northern\nconstellation of (you guessed it)\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dra/index.html\">Draco</a>.\n\nFrom left to right are\n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">edge-on spiral</a> NGC 5981,\n<a href=\"ap060520.html\">elliptical galaxy</a> NGC 5982, and\n<a href=\"ap040410.html\">face-on spiral</a> NGC 5985 --\nall within this single telescopic\nfield of view spanning a little more than\nhalf the width of the full moon.\n\nWhile the group is far too small to be a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/gal_clus.html\">galaxy cluster</a>\nand has not been\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/hickson/hcg/\">catalogued</a>\nas a compact group, these galaxies all do lie roughly\n100 million light-years from planet Earth.\n\nOn close examination with <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/\nscience/how_l1/spectral.html\">spectrographs</a>, the bright core of the\nstriking face-on spiral NGC 5985 shows\nprominent emission in specific wavelengths of light, prompting\nastronomers to classify it as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/ScholarX/\nseyferts.html\">Seyfert</a>, a type of active galaxy.\n\nNot as well known as other tight\n<a href=\"ap090313.html\">groupings of galaxies</a>,\nthe contrast in visual appearance\nmakes this triplet an attractive subject for\nastrophotographers.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://sleshin.startlogic.com/stargazergallery/\nmain.php?g2_itemId=646\">impressively\ndeep exposure</a> hints at faint, sharp-edged shells surrounding\nelliptical NGC 5982, evidence of past galactic mergers.\n\nIt also reveals many even more distant\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/\nbggalaxies.html\">background galaxies</a>.",
