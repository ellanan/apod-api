  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nExcept for the rings\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/\">of Saturn</a>, \nthe <a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m057.html\">Ring\nNebula</a> (M57) is probably the most famous celestial band.\n\nIts classic appearance is\nunderstood to be due to our own perspective, though.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/13/\ntext/\">The recent mapping</a> of the\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5233\">expanding</a> nebula's\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/13/\nimage/e/\">3-D structure</a>, based in part on\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2013/13/\">this clear Hubble image</a>,\nindicates that\nthe nebula is a relatively dense, donut-like ring wrapped\naround the middle of a football-shaped cloud of glowing gas.\n\nThe view from planet Earth looks down the long axis of the football,\nface-on to the ring.\n\nOf course, in this well-studied example of a\n<a href=\"ap110218.html\">planetary nebula</a>, the glowing material\n<a href=\"ap110901.html\">does not</a> come from planets.\n\nInstead, the gaseous shroud represents outer layers expelled\nfrom the dying,\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/balick/WFPC2/\">once\nsun-like star</a>, now a tiny pinprick of light\nseen at the nebula's center.\n\nIntense ultraviolet light from the hot central star\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/\nmod4.html#c3\">ionizes atoms</a> in the gas.\n\nIn the picture, the blue color in the center is\nionized helium, the cyan color of\nthe inner ring is the glow of hydrogen and oxygen,\nand the reddish color of the outer ring is from nitrogen and sulfur.\n\nThe Ring Nebula is about one light-year\nacross and 2,000 light-years away.",
