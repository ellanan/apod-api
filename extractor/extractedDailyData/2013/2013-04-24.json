  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens if you wring out a wet towel while floating in space?\n\nThe water shouldn't fall toward the floor because while orbiting the\nEarth, free falling objects will appear to float. \n\nBut will the water fly out from the towel, or what?\n\nThe answer may surprise you.\n\nTo <a href=\"http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2013/0416.asp\">find out</a> and to further exhibit how strange being in orbit can\nbe, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_35\">Expedition 35</a> \nCommander \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield\">Chris Hadfield</a> \ndid just this experiment last week in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgravity\">microgravity</a> \nof the Earth orbiting \n<a href=\"ap110309.html\">International Space Station</a>.\n\nAs demonstrated in the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8TssbmY-GM\">above video</a>, although a few drops do go flying\noff, most of the water sticks together and forms a unusual-looking cylindrical\nsheath in and around the towel.\n\nThe self-sticking \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension\">surface tension</a> \nof water is well known on Earth, for\nexample being used to create \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uENITui5_jU\">artistic water cascades</a> \nand, more generally, \n<a href=\"http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleprecipitation.html\">raindrops</a>.",
