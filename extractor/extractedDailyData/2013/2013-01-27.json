  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nComet McNaught of 2007 has been, so far, the most photogenic comet of our time. \n\nAfter making\n<a href=\"ap110529.html\">quite a show</a> in the northern hemisphere\nin early 2007 January, \nthe comet moved south and developed a \n<a href=\"ap070122.html\">long and unusual dust tail</a> that \n<a href=\"ap070212.html\">dazzled southern hemisphere observers</a>. \n\nIn this image, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2006_P1\">Comet McNaught</a> was captured above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago%2C_Chile\">Santiago</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.  \n\nThe bright comet dominates on the left while\npart of its magnificent tail spreads across the entire frame.    \n\nFrom this vantage point in the Andes Mountains, one looks up toward \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_mcnaught.php\">Comet\nMcNaught</a> and a magnificent sky,\nacross at a crescent moon, and down on clouds, atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze\">haze</a>,\nand the city lights.\n\nThe current year -- 2013 -- holds promise to be even better \nfor comets than 2007. \n\nIn early March,  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Pan-STARRS\">Comet PANSTARRS</a> \nis on <a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK11L040\">track to become visible</a> to the unaided eye, \nwhile at the end of the year <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_ISON\">Comet ISON</a> \nshows possibilities that include casting a \n<a href=\"ap070124.html\">tail that spreads</a> across the sky, \n<a href=\"ap060513.html\">breaking up</a>, and even becoming one of the \n<a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK12S010\">brightest comets</a> in recorded history.",
