  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is it? \n\nIt was found at the bottom of the sea aboard an ancient Greek ship.  \n\nIts seeming complexity has prompted decades of study, \nalthough some of its functions remained unknown.  \n \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/xrays.html\">X-ray</a> images of the device have confirmed the nature of the \n<a href=\"http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_4.htm\">Antikythera mechanism</a>, \nand discovered several surprising functions.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism\">Antikythera mechanism</a> has been \n<a href=\"http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/\">discovered</a> to be a \nmechanical computer of an accuracy thought \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLPVCJjTNgk\">impossible</a> \nin 80 BC, when the ship that carried it \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjTuAV036yY\">sank</a>.   \n\nSuch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CuR29OajI\">sophisticated technology</a> was not thought to be developed by humanity for another 1,000 years.\n\nIts <a href=\"http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Greek-Archae-Astr-Antikythera.htm\">wheels and gears</a> create a portable \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery\">orrery</a> of the sky \nthat predicted star and planet locations as well as \n<a href=\"ap080229.html\">lunar</a> and \n<a href=\"ap030530.html\">solar eclipse</a>s.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.antikythera-mechanism.com/\">Antikythera mechanism</a>, \n<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:NAMA_Machine_d%27Anticyth%C3%A8re_1.jpg\">shown above</a>, is 33 centimeters high and therefore \nsimilar in size to a large book.",
