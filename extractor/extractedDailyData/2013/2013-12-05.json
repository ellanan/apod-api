  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nVery faint planetary nebula Abell 7 is some 1,800 light-years distant,\njust south of Orion in planet Earth's skies in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/big/\nlepus28vm-b.jpg\">Lepus, The Hare</a>.\n\nSurrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to\ndistant background galaxies, its\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6226\">generally</a>\nsimple spherical shape, about 8 light-years\nin diameter, is outlined in\n<a href=\"http://astrodonimaging.com/gallery/\ndisplay.cfm?imgID=261\">this deep telescopic image</a>.\n\nWithin its confines are beautiful, more complex details enhanced\nby the use of <a href=\"ap111013.html\">narrowband</a> filters.\n\nEmission from hydrogen and nitrogen is shown in reddish hues with oxygen\nemission mapped to a bluish-green color, giving Abell 7 a more natural\nappearance that would otherwise be much too faint to be appreciated\n<a href=\"ap100506.html\">by eye</a>.\n\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary\nnebula</a> represents a very brief final phase\nin stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion\n<a href=\"http://www.futuretimeline.net/beyond.htm\">years hence</a>,\nas the nebula's central, once sun-like star\nshrugs off its outer layers.\n\nAbell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old.\n\nIts central star is seen here as a fading white dwarf some\n10 billion years old.",
