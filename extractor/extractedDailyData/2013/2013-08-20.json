  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAn unusual type of solar eclipse occurred last year.  \n\nUsually it is the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\">Earth's Moon</a> that \n<a href=\"http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/SolarEclipsesGoogleMaps.html\">eclipses</a> \nthe Sun.  \n\nLast June, most unusually, the planet \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Venus\">Venus</a> took a turn.  \n\nLike a <a href=\"ap121117.html\">solar eclipse</a> by the Moon, the <a href=\"http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/venus_phase.htm\">phase of Venus</a> became a continually thinner \n<a href=\"ap010619.html\">crescent</a> as Venus became increasingly \nbetter aligned with the Sun.  \n\nEventually the alignment became perfect and the \n<a href=\"ap030810.html\">phase</a> of Venus dropped to zero.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap120611.html\">dark spot</a> of Venus crossed our parent star.  \n\nThe situation could technically be labeled a Venusian \n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">annular eclipse</a> with an extraordinarily large \n<a href=\"ap020610.html\">ring of fire</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pldove/7344307970/in/photostream/\">Pictured above</a> \nduring the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>, \nwith the dark region toward the right corresponding to a \n<a href=\"ap100828.html\">coronal hole</a>.\n\nHours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a \n<a href=\"ap130814.html\">slight crescent phase</a> appeared again. \n\nThe next <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus#Past_and_future_transits\">Venusian solar eclipse</a> will occur in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2117\">2117</a>.",
