  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne hundred years ago today the \n<a href=\"http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112769773/great-meteor-procession-1913-range-uncovered-012413/\">Great Meteor Procession of 1913</a> occurred, a sky event \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011JRASC.105..167R\">described by some</a> \nas \"magnificent\" and \"entrancing\" and which left people feeling \"spellbound\" and \"privileged\".\n\nBecause one had to be in a right location, outside, and under clear skies, only about 1,000 people noted seeing the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_procession\">procession</a>. \n\nLucky sky gazers -- particularly those near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto\">Toronto</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a> -- had their eyes \ndrawn to an amazing train of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956Metic...1..405M\">bright meteors</a> \nstreaming across the sky, \nin groups, over the course of a few minutes.\n\nA current leading progenitor hypothesis is that a single \n<a href=\"ap090302.html\">large meteor once grazed</a> the Earth's atmosphere \nand broke up.\n\nWhen the resulting pieces next encountered the Earth, they came in over \nsouth-central Canada, <a href=\"http://skynotesbyrich.blogspot.com/2010/10/october-30-2010-101-procession-of.html\">traveled thousands of kilometers</a> as they crossed over the northeastern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA\">USA</a>,  \nand eventually fell into the central \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean\">Atlantic ocean</a>.\n\nPictured above is a digital scan of a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone\">halftone</a> \nhand-tinted image by the artist \n<a href=\"http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=2264\">Gustav Hahn</a> \nwho was fortunate enough to witness \n<a href=\"http://www.rasc.ca/meteor-procession-1913\">the event</a> first hand.\n\nAlthough nothing quite like the \n<a href=\"http://www.messagetoeagle.com/historicmeteor.php\">Great Meteor Procession of 1913</a> \nhas been reported since, numerous bright fireballs -- themselves \n<a href=\"ap011119.html\">pretty spectacular</a> -- have since been \n<a href=\"ap100722.html\">recorded</a>, some even \n<a href=\"ap081125.html\">on</a> \n<a href=\"ap110123.html\">video</a>.",
