  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSwinging around the Sun's eastern limb on Monday,\na group of sunspots labeled active region AR1748 has produced the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/\nNews051513-ar1748.html\">first four X-class solar flares of 2013</a>\nin less than 48 hours.\n\nIn time sequence clockwise from the top left,\nflashes from the four were captured in extreme ultraviolet images\nfrom the <a href=\"ap130426.html\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>.\n\nRanked\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/glossary/flareclasses.html\">according\nto their peak brightness in X-rays</a>, X-class flares\nare the most powerful class and are frequently accompanied by\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">coronal\nmass ejections</a> (CMEs),\nmassive clouds of high energy plasma launched into space.\n\nBut CMEs from the first three flares were not Earth-directed,\nwhile one associated with the fourth flare may deliver a\nglancing blow to the\n<a href=\"http://www.phy6.org/Education/wms1.html\">Earth's magnetic field</a>\non May 18.\n\nAlso causing temporary radio blackouts, AR1748 is likely not finished.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/\">Still forecast</a>\nto have a\n<a href=\"http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/forecast.html\">significant chance</a>\nof producing\nstrong flares, the active region is rotating\ninto more direct view\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\">across the Sun's nearside</a>.",
