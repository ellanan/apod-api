  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe bright core and outer reaches of giant\n<a href=\"ap120914.html\">elliptical galaxy M60</a>\n(NGC 4649) loom large at the upper left of this sharp close-up\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nSome 54 million light-years away and 120,000 light-years across,\nM60 is one of the largest galaxies in the nearby\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/vir.html\">Virgo\nCluster</a>.\n\nIn cosmic contrast, the small, round smudge at picture center\nis now recognized as\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/m60/\">an\nultra-compact dwarf galaxy</a>.\n\nCataloged as M60-UCD1, it may well be\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7707\">the densest galaxy</a> in the\nnearby universe.\n\nConcentrating half of its total mass of 200 million\nsuns into a radius of only 80 light-years,\nstars in the inner regions of M60-UCD1 are on\naverage 25 times closer together than in planet Earth's\n<a href=\"ap130924.html\">neighborhood</a> of the Milky Way.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/blog/node/454\">Exploring the nature</a>\nof M60-UCD1, astronomers are trying to determine\nif ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are the\ncentral remnants of larger galaxies that have been\n<a href=\"ap121108.html\">tidally stripped</a> by\ngravitatonal encounters, or evolved as massive\n<a href=\"ap120614.html\">globular star clusters</a>.\n\nRecently discovered,\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/m60/\">a bright\nX-ray source</a> seen at its center\ncould be due to a supermassive black hole.\n\nIf so, that would favor a remnant galaxy origin for M60-UCD1.",
