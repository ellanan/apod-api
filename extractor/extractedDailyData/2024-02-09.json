  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nNot all roses are red\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roses_Are_Red\">of course</a>,\nbut they can still be very pretty.\n\nLikewise, the beautiful\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/nebulae/ngc2237.html\">Rosette\nNebula</a> and other star forming regions are often shown in\nastronomical images with a predominately red hue,\nin part because the dominant emission in the nebula is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">from hydrogen atoms</a>.\n\nHydrogen's strongest optical emission line, known as H-alpha,\nis in the red region of the spectrum.\n\nBut the beauty of an emission nebula need not be appreciated\nin red light alone.\n\nOther atoms in the nebula are also excited by energetic\nstarlight and produce narrow emission lines as well.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/net448/\">In this close-up view</a>\nof the Rosette Nebula, narrowband images are mapped into broadband\ncolors to show emission from Sulfur atoms in red, Hydrogen in green, and\nOxygen in blue.\n\nIn fact, the\n<a href=\"https://aaa.org/2020/06/23/pillars-of-creation-using-the-hubble-palette/\">scheme of mapping</a>\nthese narrow atomic emission lines (SHO) into the broader colors (RGB) is\nadopted in many\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/home\">Hubble images</a>\nof emission nebulae.\n\nThis image spans about 50 light-years across the center of the\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2244.html\">Rosette Nebula</a>.\n\nThe nebula lies some 3,000\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/5000lys.html\">light-years away</a>\nin the constellation Monoceros.",
