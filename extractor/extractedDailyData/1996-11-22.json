  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Planetary nebulae are strange. First, they\nare gas clouds and have nothing to do with <a href=\"ap950819.html\">our Solar System</a>'s\nplanets. Next, although hundreds of <a href=\"lib/planetary.html\">planetary nebulae</a>\nhave been catalogued and thousands surely exist in <a href=\"ap960213.html\">our Galaxy</a>,\naspects of the formation process are still debated. But now yet\nanother mystery has come to light: what created the fast-moving\ngas clouds that appear around <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebula</a>?\nDubbed <a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/W_F_P_C_2/\">FLIERs</a>\nfor Fast Low-Ionization Emission Regions, these knots of dense\ngas appear to have been ejected from the central star <i>before</i>\nit cast of the planetary nebula. Currently, no model can account\nfor either their formation or longevity.  In the above false-color picture\nof NGC 7662, the <a href=\"ap961121.html\">Blue Snowball Planetary Nebula</a>,\nthe FLIERs are featured in the image inserts.",
