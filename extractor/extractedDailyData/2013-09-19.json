  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn this engaging scene\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">from planet Earth</a>,\nthe Moon shines through cloudy skies following sunset\non the evening of September 8.\n\nDespite the fading light, the camera's long exposure still\nrecorded a colorful, detailed view of a shoreline and\nwestern horizon looking toward the island\nSan Gabriel from Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay.\n\nLights from Buenos Aires, Argentina are along the horizon on the left,\nacross the broad\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/\nview.php?id=4028\">Rio de la Plata estuary</a>.\n\nThe long exposure strongly overexposed the Moon and sky around it,\nthough.\n\nSo the photographer quickly snapped a shorter one to merge\nwith the first image in the area around the bright lunar disk.\n\nAs the the second image was made with a telephoto setting,\nthe digital merger captures both Earth and sky, exaggerating\nthe young Moon's slender crescent shape in relation to\nthe two nearby bright stars.\n\nThe more distant is\n<a href=\"ap120823.html\">bluish Spica, alpha star</a>\nof the constellation Virgo.\n\nClosest to the Moon is Earth's\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/bill-dunford/\n20130819-map.html\">evening star, planet Venus</a>, emerging from\n<a href=\"ap130913.html\">a lunar occultation</a>.",
