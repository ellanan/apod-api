  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those unusual looking dimples?  \n\nLooking back toward <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20040323a.html\">Eagle crater</a>, its landing place on \n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html\">robot rover Opportunity</a> \nhas spotted some unusual depressions in the Martian soil.  \n\nThe dimples, <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/mar-23-2004/captions/image-6.html\">visible above</a> on the image left, \neach measure about one meter across and appear to have \nlight colored rock in their interior.  \n\nThe nearest dimple has been dubbed \n\"<a href=\"http://mlb.com/\">Homeplate</a>\", \nwhile the next furthest one out is called \"First Base.\"  \n\nScrolling right will reveal a <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20040323a.html\">magnificent panorama</a> including the rover in the foreground, the <a href=\"http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/1/p/021/1P130048201ESF0352P2379L7M1.HTML\">backshell and parachute</a> that detached from Opportunity \nbefore it landed near the horizon, Eagle crater in the center, \nOpportunity's tracks as it rolled away from Eagle crater, and \n<a href=\"ap990112.html\">wind blown ripples</a> of \n<a href=\"ap040118.html\">Martian soil</a> in every direction.  \n\nFurther analysis of \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/mar-23-2004/captions/image-2.html\">rocks photographed</a> by Opportunity has \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/mar-23-2004/captions/image-8.html\">yielded evidence</a> that Opportunity has landed on an \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040323a.html\">evaporated shoreline of an ancient salt-water ocean</a>.",
