  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nChicago, in a way, is like a modern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge\">Stonehenge</a>.\n\nThe way is east to west, and the time is today. \n\nToday, and every \n<a href=\"ap210922.html\">equinox</a>, the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> \nwill set exactly to the west, everywhere on \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">Earth</a>.\n\nTherefore, today in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago\">Chicago</a>, \nthe Sun will set directly down the long equatorially-aligned \n<a href=\"https://www.domu.com/blog/decoding-the-chicago-street-grid-system\">grid of streets</a> and buildings, an event dubbed \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23chicagohenge\">#chicagohenge</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthony_artese/status/910309187049148417\">Featured here</a> is a \n<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-viewing-chicagohenge-when-and-how-it-works-20150922s-htmlstory.html\">Chicago Henge</a> \npicture taken during the  \n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/tag/equinox/\">equinox</a> \nin mid-September of 2017 looking along part of Upper <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacker_Drive\">Wacker Drive</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/03/mapping-street-numbering-us-new-york-philadelphia/472809/\">Many cities</a>, though, \nhave <a href=\"ap240319.html\">streets</a> or other \n<a href=\"ap170621.html\">features</a> that are \n<a href=\"ap140706.html\">well-aligned</a> to Earth's spin axis.\n\nTherefore, quite possibly, your  \n<a href=\"http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/police-rescue-sloth-cross-highway-ecuador-6.jpg\">favorite street</a> may also run east - west.\n\nTonight at sunset, with a quick glance, you can <a href=\"https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/00/34/33/73/1000_F_34337307_NVRxBN6qAPMSzwlLvHk91LZHTnPPemts.jpg\">actually find out</a>.",
