  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's rising above the horizon behind those clouds?\n\nIt's the Sun. \n\nMost sunrises don't look like this, though, because most sunrises don't include the Moon.\n\nIn the early morning of 2013 May 10, however, from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia\">Western</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, \nthe Moon was between the Earth and the rising \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>. \n\nAt times, it would be hard for the \n<a href=\"ap130513.html\">uninformed</a> to understand what was happening. \n\nIn an <a href=\"https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x630/annular-solar-eclipse.png\">annular eclipse</a>, the Moon is too far from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> to block the entire Sun, \nand at most leaves a \n<a href=\"ap170301.html\">ring of fire</a> \nwhere sunlight pours out around every edge of the Moon. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJfpqSj7cCs\">featured time-lapse video</a> \nalso recorded the eclipse through the high refraction of the Earth's atmosphere just above the horizon, making the \n<a href=\"ap191228.html\">unusual rising Sun and Moon</a> appear also \n<a href=\"https://www.seniorcatwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Cat-is-Lying-Flat-on-Its-Back.jpg\">flattened</a>. \n\nAs the video continues on, the Sun continues to rise, and the Sun and Moon begin to separate. \n\nThis weekend, a new \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2020-june-21\">annular solar eclipse</a> \nwill occur, visible from central Africa, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula\">Arabian Peninsula</a>, and a narrow band across Asia, with much of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Hemisphere\">Earth's Eastern hemisphere</a> \nbeing able to see a \n<a href=\"ap191227.html\">partial solar eclipse</a>.",
