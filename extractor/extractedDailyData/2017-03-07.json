  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does this galaxy spin so fast? \n\nTo start, even identifying which type of galaxy \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1709a/\">UGC 12591</a> is difficult -- it has dark dust lanes like a spiral galaxy but a large diffuse bulge of stars like a \n<a href=\"ap020408.html\">lenticular</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dvsjr.com/Home-alone-dog-destroys-toilet-paper.jpg\">Surprisingly</a> observations show that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013hst..prop13370G\">UGC 12591</a> \nspins at about 480 km/sec, almost twice as fast as our \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/charting-the-milky-way-from-the-inside-out\">Milky Way</a>, and the fastest rotation rate yet measured.  \n\nThe mass needed to hold together a galaxy spinning this fast is several times the mass of our \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/galaxy-location.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nProgenitor scenarios for \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...301L...7G\">UGC 12591</a> \ninclude \n<a href=\"ap120717.html\">slow growth</a> by accreting ambient matter, \nor rapid growth through a recent \n<a href=\"ap150419.html\">galaxy collision</a> or \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">collisions</a> -- \nfuture observations may tell.  \n\nThe light we see today from UGC 12591 left about \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian\">400 million years ago</a>, when \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree\">tree</a>s were first developing on \n<a href=\"ap100713.html\">Earth</a>.",
