  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere goes another one! \n\nVolcanoes on \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>'s moon \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)\">Io</a> keep erupting.\n\nTo investigate, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/about/\">NASA</a>'s robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno\">Juno</a><a> \nspacecraft has begun a series of visits to this \n</a><a href=\"https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg\">very strange</a> moon.\n\n<a href=\"https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/web/assets/pictures/20130619_solar-system-major-moons-by-location-withtext.jpg\">Io is about the size of Earth's moon</a>, but because of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism_on_Io#Heat_source\">gravitational flexing</a> by Jupiter and other moons, \nIo's interior gets heated and its surface has become \n<a href=\"ap110522.html\">covered with volcanoes</a>. \n\nThe featured image is from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yJUJmI8YI_E\">last week's flyby</a>, \npassing within 12,000 kilometers above the dangerously active world.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap221211.html\">surface of Io</a> \nis covered with sulfur and frozen sulfur dioxide, \nmaking it appear yellow, orange and brown.\n\nAs hoped, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/\">Juno</a> flew by \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/163766/juno-completes-its-closest-flyby-of-io-yet/\">just as</a> a volcano was erupting -- \nwith its faint plume visible near the top of the featured image. \n\nStudying Io's volcanoes and plumes helps humanity better understand how \n<a href=\"ap220830.html\">Jupiter's complex system</a> of moons, rings, and auroras interact.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Io#Juno_spacecraft\">Juno is scheduled</a> to make two flybys of Io during the coming months that are almost 10 times closer: one in December and another in February 2024.",
