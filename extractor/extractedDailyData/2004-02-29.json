  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday, February 29th, is a \n<a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapDay.html\">leap day</a> - a relatively rare occurrence.\n\nIn 46 BC, <a href=\"http://heraklia.fws1.com\">Julius Caesar</a>, pictured \nabove in a self-decreed minted coin, created a calendar system that added \none <a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html\">leap day</a> every four years.\n\nActing on advice by <a href=\"http://www.ics.forth.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks/hellinistic_period.html\">Alexandrian</a> astronomer <a href=\"http://www.fact-index.com/s/so/sosigenes.html\">Sosigenes</a>, \nCaesar did this to make up for the fact that the Earth's \nyear is slightly more than 365 days.\n\nIn modern terms, the time it takes for the \n<a href=\"ap990131.html\">Earth</a> to circle \nthe <a href=\"ap000110.html\">Sun</a> is slightly more than the \ntime it takes for the Earth to rotate 365 times (with respect \nto the Sun -- actually we now know this takes about 365.24219 rotations).\n\nSo, if calendar years contained 365 days they would drift\nfrom the actual year by about 1 day every 4 years.\n\nEventually July (named posthumously for <a href=\"http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html\">Julius Caesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern \nhemisphere winter!\n\nBy adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, \nthe <a href=\"http://www.earth.com/calendar\">calendar year</a> would drift much less.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/calendopaedia/julian.htm\">Julian Calendar</a> system was used until the year 1582 when \n<a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07001b.htm\">Pope Gregory XIII</a>provided further fine-tuning when he added that leap days \nshould not occur in years ending in \"OO\", unless divisible by 400.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/gregorian_calendar.html\">\nGregorian Calendar</a> system is the one in common use today.",
