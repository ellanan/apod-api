  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn February 1987, light from the brightest stellar explosion\nseen in <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/\nknow_l2/cool_supernovae_fact.html\">modern times</a> reached Earth --\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/\nsn87a.html\">supernova SN1987A</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/\nfuture/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nimage from the sharp Advanced\nCamera for Surveys taken in November 2003 shows\nthe explosion site over 16 years later.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n2004/09/image/b\">snap shot</a>\nindicates that the supernova <a href=\"ap020223.html\">blast wave</a>\ncontinues to impact a pre-existing, one light-year wide\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n1997/14/astrofile/\">ring of material</a>, and the\nnascent central <a href=\"ap030926.html\">supernova remnant</a>\ncontinues to expand.\n\nLike <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n2004/09/\">pearls on a cosmic necklace</a>, bright hot spots\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/animations/\npulsar.html#sn1987a\">produced as</a> the\nblast wave heats material up to millions of degrees began to appear\non the ring in the mid 1990s and have been followed\n<a href=\"ap000512.html\">across the spectrum</a>\nby astronomers ever since.\n\nSupernova SN1987A lies in the\n<a href=\"ap010804.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>,\na neighboring galaxy some 170,000 light-years away.\n\nThat really does mean that the explosive event -\nthe core collapse and detonation of a star about 20 times as massive\nas the Sun - occurred\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/\nlightspeed.html\">170,000 years before</a> February 1987.",
