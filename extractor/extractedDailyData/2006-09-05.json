  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes the bright streaks on Dione?  \n\nRecent images of this unusual moon by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> \nare helping to crack the mystery.  \n\nClose inspection of Dione's trailing hemisphere, \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08256\">pictured above</a>, indicates that the white wisps are composed of deep \n<a href=\"ap051026.html\">ice cliffs</a> dropping hundreds of meters.\n\nThe cliffs may indicate that Dione has undergone some sort of \n<a href=\"http://www.seismo.unr.edu/ftp/pub/louie/class/100/plate-tectonics.html\">tectonic surface</a> displacements in its past.\n\nThe bright ice-cliffs run across some of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29\">Dione</a>'s many craters, indicating that the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1984Icar...59..205M\">process</a> that created them occurred later than the \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">impacts</a> that created those craters. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/dione.html\">Dione</a> \nis made of mostly water ice but its relatively high density \nindicates that it contains much \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll\">rock</a> inside. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/Bios/cassini.html\">Giovanni Cassini</a> discovered Dione in 1684. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08256\">above image</a> was taken at the end of July from a distance of about 263,000 kilometers.\n\nOther <a href=\"ap951009.html\">high resolution image</a>s of \nDione were taken by the passing \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html\">Voyager spacecraft</a> in 1980.",
