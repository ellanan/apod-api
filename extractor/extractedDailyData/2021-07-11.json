  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere's the Moon?\n\nSomewhere in this image, the Earth's Moon is hiding.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap210222.html\">entire Moon</a> is visible, in its completely full phase, \nin plain sight.\n\nEven the photographer's keen eye couldn't find it even though he knew exactly where to look -- only the\n<a href=\"ap110717.html\">long exposure</a> of his camera picked it up -- barely.  \n\nAlthough by now you might be <a href=\"https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/01/25/cat-birthday.jpg\">congratulating yourself</a> on finding it, why was it so difficult to see?\n\nFor one reason, this photograph was taken during a\n<a href=\"ap111214.html\">total lunar eclipse</a>, when the Earth's \n<a href=\"ap111215.html\">shadow</a> made \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> much dimmer than a normal full Moon.\n\nFor another, the image, taken in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado\">Colorado</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state\">USA</a>,\nwas captured just before sunrise.\n\nWith <a href=\"ap171203.html\">the Moon</a> \non the exact opposite side of the sky from the Sun, \nthis meant that the Sun was just below the horizon, but still\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight\">slightly illuminating</a>\nthe sky.\n\nLast, as the\n<a href=\"ap180624.html\">Moon</a> was only about two degrees above the horizon, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy)\">large volume of air</a> between the camera and the horizon scattered a lot of light away from the\n<a href=\"ap200322.html\">background Moon</a>.\n\nTwelve minutes after this image was acquired in 2012, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">the Sun</a> peeked over the horizon and the Moon set.",
