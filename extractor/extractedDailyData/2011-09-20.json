  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you stay up long enough, you can watch both suns set.\n\nSuch might be a common adage from \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/J/Jupiterlife.html\">beings floating</a> in the atmosphere of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-16b\">Kepler 16b</a>, a planet recently discovered by the space-based Kepler satellite.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0MfRo0eC1ks\">above animated video</a> shows how the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1e9ihO_uc\">planetary system</a> \nmight look to a visiting spaceship.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">multiple star</a> systems are quite common, \nthis is the first known to have a planet.\n\nBecause our Earth is in the \n<a href=\"ap100731.html\">orbital plane</a> of both stars and the planet, each body is seen to eclipse the others at different times, producing \n<a href=\"http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/kepler16b/\">noticeable drop offs</a> in the amount of light seen.\n\nThe frequent eclipses have given \n<a href=\"http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/nasakeplernews/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=152\">Kepler 16b</a> the most accurate mass and radius \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6049/1602.short\">determination</a> for a planet outside our Solar System.\n\nTo find a planet like \n<a href=\"ap100215.html\">Saturn</a> in an orbit like \n<a href=\"ap031130.html\">Venus</a> -- so close to its binary star parents -- was a <a href=\"http://www.weirdnano.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/old-computer-thumb.jpg\">surprise</a> and will surely become a focus of research.",
