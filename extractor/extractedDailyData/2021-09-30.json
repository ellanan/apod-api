  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGorgeous spiral galaxy M33 seems to have more than its fair share of\nglowing hydrogen gas.\n\nA prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also\nknown as the <a href=\"ap191231.html\">Triangulum Galaxy</a> and\nlies a mere 3 million light-years away. \n\nSprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core,\nM33's giant\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region\">HII regions are</a>\nsome of the largest known stellar nurseries,\nsites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars.\n\nIntense ultraviolet radiation\nfrom the luminous massive stars ionizes\nthe surrounding hydrogen gas and\nultimately produces the characteristic red glow.\n\nTo highlight the HII regions in this telescopic image,\nbroadband data used to produce a color view\nof the galaxy were combined with narrowband data recorded through a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha#Filter\">hydrogen-alpha filter</a>,\ntransmitting the light of the strongest\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha#/media/File:Emission_spectrum-H.svg\">hydrogen emission line</a>.\n\nClose-ups of cataloged HII regions appear in the sidebar insets.\n\nUse the individual reference number to\nfind their location within the Triangulum Galaxy.\n\nFor example, giant\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2003/30/1422-Image.html\">HII region NGC604</a>\nis identified in an inset on the right and appears at position number 15.\n\nThat's about 4 o'clock from galaxy center in\n<a href=\"https://www.lucafornaciarifotografia.com/2021/09/26/astrofotografia-sulla-galassia-triangolo-m33-e-le-sue-nebulose/\">this portrait of M33</a>.",
