  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBlasting outward from variable star KX Andromedae,\nthese stunning bipolar jets are 19 light-years long.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024RNAAS...8..289Z/abstract\">Recently discovered</a>,\nthey are revealed in unprecedented detail\nin this deep telescopic image centered on KX And\nand composed from over\n<a href=\"https://app.astrobin.com/i/nllu5u?r=0\">692 hours of combined image data</a>.\n\nIn fact, KX And is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star#Spectroscopic_binaries\">spectroscopically found</a>\nto be an interacting binary star system consisting\nof a bright, hot B-type star with a\n<a href=\"ap060722.html\">swollen</a> cool giant star as its co-orbiting,\nclose companion.\n\nThe stellar material from the cool giant star is likely being\ntransferred to the hot B-type star through an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk\">accretion disk</a>,\nwith spectacular symmetric jets driven outward perpendicular to the\ndisk itself.\n\nThe known distance to KX And of 2,500 light-years,\nangular size of the jets,\nand estimated inclination of the accretion disk lead to\nthe size estimate for each jet of an\n<a href=\"https://www.astroexplorer.org/details/rnaasad9478f1\">astonishing 19 light-years</a>.",
