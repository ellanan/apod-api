Where does the energy come from?\n\nMany believe\nthe quasar's central engine is a giant black hole\nfueled by tremendous amounts of infalling gas, dust, and stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/35.html\">This recently released gallery of quasar portraits</a> from the Hubble Space\nTelescope offers a look at their local neighborhoods: the quasars themselves\nappear as the bright star-like objects with diffraction spikes.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/35/A.html\">The images</a> in the center and right hand columns reveal quasars\nassociated with disrupted colliding and merging galaxies\nwhich should provide\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9611183\">plenty of debris</a> to feed a hungry\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a>.\n\nYet, in the left hand column a quasar is seen at the\ncenter of an otherwise normal looking spiral (above) and\nelliptical galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E468L%2E%2E91B&amp;db_key=AST\">Whatever the secret of the quasar's energy</a>,\nall these sites must provide fuel for its central engine.",
