  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nUsing the new camera on the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/reference_desk/faq/\nanswer.php.id=77&amp;cat=topten\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>,\nastronomers have been able to confirm that the Moon is\n<a href=\"http://www.planetfusion.co.uk/~pignut/cheese.html\">made of\ngreen cheese</a>.  \n\nThe telling clue was the resolution of a marked date after which the\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html\">Moon</a> may go bad.  \n\n<a href=\"http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/Kardas/Courses/\nGPWeiten/C1Intro/GreenCheese.html\">Controversy</a> still exists, however, \nover whether the date resolved is truly an\n<a href=\"http://www.consumeraffairs.com/nutrition/\nexpiration_dates.htm\">expiration date</a> or just a \"sell by\" date.  \n\n\"To be cautious, we should completely \ndevour the Moon by tomorrow,\" a spokesperson advised.  \n\nHappy April Fool's Day from the folks at\n<a href=\"ap050616.html\">APOD</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/\nra9_b001.html\">above image</a> (slightly altered) was actually taken\nin 1965 by the\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/\nMasterCatalog?sc=1965-023A\">Ranger 9</a> probe minutes before impact.  \n\nThe popular\n<a href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990723a.html\">Moon is\nmade of Green Cheese</a> myth can be traced back almost 500 years.  \n\nIt has been used historically in context\nto indicate a claim so clearly false that no one -- not even \n<a href=\"http://wilstar.com/holidays/aprilfool.htm\">April Fools</a> \n-- will believe it.",
