  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat caused the pits, ridges, and gullies on \notherwise smooth Martian terrain?  \n\nOne <a href=\"http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2001-02/01-006.html\">hypothesis</a> is water.  \n\nThe lack of \n<a href=\"ap010108.html\">craters</a> at this \nmid-latitude location indicates that the terrain \nis quite young by geological standards, \nperhaps only 100,000 years old.  \n\nWere the terrain since saturated by water ice, \nthat ice would soon evaporate into the \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/saf/1109/features/mars.htm\">thin Martian air</a>.  \n\nLeft over, however, might be fragile \n<a href=\"http://www.cakerecipe.com/\">cake</a>-like <a href=\"http://www.paccd.cc.ca.us/instadmn/physcidv/geol_dp/dndougla/SAND/Aboutsnd.htm\">sand</a> that can be broken up by wind into pits and ridges.  \n\nConsequences of \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1456000/1456708.stm\">this hypothesis</a> include that even the \n<a href=\"ap010628.html\">Martian equator</a> \nundergoes epochs of relative wet and dry, \nand that future spacefarers might be able to find \n<a href=\"ap010417.html\">water</a> (ice) in a relatively \nmild climate near the \n<a href=\"http://www.marsdaily.com/water.html\">Martian</a> equator.\n\n<a href=\"http://ida.wr.usgs.gov/html/m03049/m0304950.html\">Pictured above</a> is young-ridged terrain that \nalso shows evidence of a \n<a href=\"ap000626.html\">downhill flow</a>.",
