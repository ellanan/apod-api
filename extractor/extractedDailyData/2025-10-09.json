  "explanation": "That big, bright, beautiful Full Moon you watched rise on the night of October 6 was the Harvest Moon. Famed in festival, story, and song, Harvest Moon is just the traditional name of the full moon nearest the time of the northern hemisphere's autumnal equinox. According to lore the name is a fitting one. Despite the diminishing daylight hours, as the growing season drew to a close in the north, farmers could harvest crops by the light of a full moon shining on from dusk to dawn. Later this year than usual, in 2025 October's Harvest Moon was also known to some as a supermoon, a term becoming a traditional name for a full moon near the time of lunar perigee. And this telephoto snapshot of the (almost) full moon rising above a conspicuous skyscraper in New York city, taken on October 5, is suggestive of yet another full moon moniker.",
