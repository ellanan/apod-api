  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGalactic or\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/open.html\">open star clusters</a>\nare young.\n\nThe swarms of stars are born together near the plane of the Milky Way,\nbut their numbers\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster#Eventual_fate\">steadily dwindle</a>\nas cluster members are\nejected by galactic tides and gravitational interactions.\n\nCaught in\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/ok6qec/\">this telescopic frame</a>\nover three degrees across are three\ngood examples of galactic star clusters,\nseen toward the southern sky's nautical constellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/pup/index.html\">Puppis</a>.\n\nBelow and left, <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/35075/messier-46/\">M46 is</a>\nsome 5,500 light-years in the distance.\n\nRight of center\n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/35129/messier-47-star-cluster/\">M47 is</a>\nonly 1,600 light-years away and\nNGC 2423 (top) is about 2500 light-years distant.\n\nAround 300 million years young M46\ncontains a few hundred stars in a region about 30 light-years\nacross.\n\nSharp eyes can spot a planetary nebula,\n<a href=\"ap120403.html\">NGC 2438</a>,\nat about 11 o'clock against the M46 cluster stars.\n\nBut that nebula's\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/white_dwarfs.html\">central star</a>\nis billions of years old, and\nNGC 2438 is likely a foreground object only by chance\nalong the line of sight to youthful M46.\n\nEven younger, aged around 80 million years, M47 is a\nsmaller and looser star cluster spanning about 10 light-years.\n\nStar cluster NGC 2423 is pushing about 750 million years\n<a href=\"ap171115.html\">in age</a> though.\n\nNGC 2423 is known to harbor an extrasolar planet,\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2174\">detected</a> orbiting one\nof its red giant stars.",
