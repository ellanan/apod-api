Discovered even \n<a href=\"ap950820.html\">before</a> the \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/\">Great Comet of 1996</a>, Comet Hale-Bopp became \nthe brightest comet since \n<a href=\"ap950826.html\">1976</a>.  \n\nMany will remember \n<a href=\"ap970825.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> as a comet with a \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#coma\">coma</a> so bright it could be \nseen by eye even when near the \n<a href=\"ap970723.html\">Moon</a>.  Others will remember \n<a href=\"ap970416.html\">spectacular photographs</a> \nthat appeared in magazines and on the web.  \n\nAmateurs, inspired by the \n<a href=\"ap970317.html\">beauty of the comet</a>, \ntook most of these photographs.  \nIn particular, today \n<a href=\"lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a> salutes \nWally Pacholka, who took the above famous photograph.  \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/pach1.html\">Mr. Pacholka reports</a> that he repeatedly drove 150 miles to a \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/jotr/\">national park</a>, \nstayed up half the night, and took hundreds of photos while \ncarefully waving a flashlight to momentarily illuminate the foreground.   \nHis equipment consisted only of a standard 35-mm camera which,\nfor pointing accuracy, he\npiggybacked on a telescope bought at age 12 with money \nearned from a paper route.",
