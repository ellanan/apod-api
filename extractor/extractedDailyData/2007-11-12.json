  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere do \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays\">cosmic rays</a> \ncome from?  \n\nA major step toward answering this \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays#History\">century old question</a> \nmay have just come in from the \n<a href=\"http://www.auger.org/observatory/\">Auger Observatory</a> project, \nthe world's premier cosmic ray observatory.  \n\nThat high energy fundamental particles are barreling through the universe has been \n<a href=\"http://www.p-ng.si/public/pao/history.php\">known</a> for about a century.  \n\nBecause <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays#Ultra-high-energy_cosmic_rays\">ultra high energy cosmic rays</a> are so rare and because their \nextrapolated directions are so imprecise, no progenitor objects have ever been\n<a href=\"http://www.auger.org/technical_info/icrc_2007.html\">unambiguously implied</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.auger.org/news/PRagn/AGN_correlation.html\">New results</a> \nfrom Auger, however, indicate that 12 of 15 ultra high energy cosmic rays have \n<a href=\"http://www.auger.org/news/PRagn/images/skymap_0708_27ev_v4r6p1.gif\">sky directions</a> statistically consistent with the positions of nearby \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus\">active galactic nuclei</a>.   \n\nThese \n<a href=\"ap991017.html\">galactic centers</a> \nare already known to emit great amounts of light and are likely powered by large\n<a href=\"http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/BHfaq.html\">black holes</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.auger.org/news/PRagn/AGN_correlation_more.html\">Auger results</a> also \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;318/5852/938\">indicate</a> \nthat the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GZK_cutoff\">highest energy cosmic rays</a> \nare protons, since the electric charge of higher energy nuclei would force the \n<a href=\"ap050825.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/RebeccaRudberg.shtml\">magnetic field</a> \nto deflect and effectively erase progenitor source direction.\n\nPictured above, an artist illustrates a \n<a href=\"ap060814.html\">cosmic ray</a> striking the Earth's atmosphere and \ncreating a shower of secondary particles detectable on the surface.   \n\nThe image of \n<a href=\"ap030806.html\">Centaurus A</a> digitally superposed near the top \nsignifies one such active galaxy from which \n<a href=\"http://www.mininggazette.com/stories/articles.asp?articleID=9354\">cosmic rays</a> might originate.",
