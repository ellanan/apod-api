  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt's the closest match to Earth that has yet been found.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepscicon-briefing.html\">Recently discovered</a> planet Kepler 22b has therefore instantly become the\nbest place to find life outside our Solar System. \n\nThe planet's host star, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_22\">Kepler 22</a>, is actually slightly smaller and cooler than the \n<a href=\"ap110207.html\">Sun</a>, and lies 600 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> from Earth toward the constellation of the Swan \n(<a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_4454684_find-swan-constellation.html\">Cygnus</a>).\n\nThe planet, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-22b\">Kepler 22b</a>, is over twice the radius of the Earth and orbits slightly closer in, but lies in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone\">habitable zone</a> where liquid water could exist on the surface.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/images/kepler-22b-diagram.html\">Pictured above</a> is an artist's depiction of how \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en5OObU0ryU\">Kepler 22b</a> \nmight appear to an \n<a href=\"ap100216.html\">approaching spaceship</a>, \nin comparison to the inner planets of our Solar System.   \n\nWhether Kepler 22b actually contains water or life is currently unknown.\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.seti.org/\">SETI</a> project, however, will \n<a href=\"http://www.seti.org/node/905\">begin monitoring</a> Kepler 22b for signs of intelligence.",
