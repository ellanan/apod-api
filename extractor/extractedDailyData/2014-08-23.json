  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe city of Veszprem, Hungary was only briefly haunted by\nthis mysterious spectre.\n\nOn the morning of August 11, its monstrous form hovered\nin the mist above municipal buildings near the town center.\n\n<a href=\"ap040806.html\">A clue</a>\nto its true identity is offered by the photographer, though,\nwho reports he took the picture from the top of a twenty story building\nwith the rising Sun directly at his back.\n\nThat special geometry suggests this is an example of\nan atmospheric phenomenon called\n<a href=\"ap040806.html\">the Glory</a> or sometimes\n\"<a href=\"http://www.polarization.com/rainbow/rainbow2.html#specter\">the\nSpectre of the Brocken</a>\".\n\nAlso seen from mountain tops and airplanes when looking opposite\nthe Sun, the dramatic apparition is the observer's shadow on\nclouds or fog, the small droplets of water scattering\nlight back towards the Sun through\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/glofeat.htm\">complex\ninternal reflections</a>.\n\nCareful night sky  watchers can also encounter this spectre's analog\nin astronomy, a brightening of zodiacal light opposite the Sun\nknown as <a href=\"ap140114.html\">the gegenschein</a>.",
