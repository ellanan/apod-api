  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAsteroid 2005 YU55 passed by the Earth yesterday, posing no danger.  \n\nThe space rock, \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-343\">estimated</a> to be about 400 meters across, coasted by just inside the orbit of Earth's Moon.   \n\nAlthough the passing of smaller rocks near the Earth is  \n<a href=\"ap110306.html\">not very unusual</a> -- in fact small rocks from space strike Earth daily --  a rock this large hasn't passed this close since 1976.\n\nWere <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YU55\">YU55</a> to have struck land, \nit might have caused a \n<a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/magnitude.html\">magnitude</a> seven \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqTNfNQjrug\">earthquake</a> \nand left a city-sized <a href=\"ap090517.html\">crater</a>.  \n\nA perhaps larger danger would have occurred were \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/multimedia/yu55-20111107.html\">YU55</a>  \nto have struck the ocean and raised a large \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami\">tsunami</a>.\n\nThe above <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15019\">radar image</a> was taken two days ago by the \n<a href=\"http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/\">Deep Space Network</a> \nradio telescope in \n<a href=\"http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/features/goldstonetours.html\">Goldstone</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YU55\">YU55</a> \nwas discovered only in 2005, indicating that other \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/\">potentially hazardous asteroids</a> might lurk in \n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">our Solar System</a> currently undetected.  \n\nObjects like YU55 are hard to detect because they are so faint and \n<a href=\"ap060328.html\">move</a> so fast. \n\nHowever, humanity's ability to scan the sky to detect, catalog, and analyze such objects has \n<a href=\"http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/\">increased notably</a> in recent years.",
