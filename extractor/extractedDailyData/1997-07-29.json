  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe rocks on Mars tell us stories about their past.  To decipher these stories, a \n<a href=\"http://www.marin.cc.ca.us/~bpeters/jim/109one.htm\">scientist \nmust become a detective</a>, searching for clues and \nfitting them with theories.  The \n<a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/ops/sol19-20.html\">above \nphotograph</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap970722.html\">rocky Martian surface</a> to the northeast of \n<a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/default1.html\">Pathfinder</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap970724.html\">landing site</a> provides many such clues.  \nFor example, at least three types of rocks are evident, marked with red, \nwhite and blue arrows.  The red arrows point to smooth rocks, which \n<a href=\"http://entertainment.digital.com/mars/exclusive-video.html\">Pathfinder scientists</a> hypothesize have been eroded by tumbling \nthrough ancient channels of water which evaporated long ago.  \nThe blue arrows indicate a different type of rock, ragged ones \nwith sharp edges, hypothesized to have been ejected when \n<a href=\"ap970722.html\">nearby craters</a> formed or \n<a href=\"ap950719.html\">volcanoes</a> erupted.  The white \nareas are more mysterious, and might be some sort of composite material.  \n<a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/rover/faqs_sojourner.html\">Sojourner</a> was recently diverted to study these white areas to \ngather more clues so continued detective work can yield better \ninsight into the Martian past.",
