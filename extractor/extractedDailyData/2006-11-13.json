  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening at the south pole of Saturn?  \n\nTo find out, scientists sent the robot \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens\">Cassini probe</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://eightplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>\n directly over the lower spin axis of the ringed giant.  \n\nCassini found there a spectacular massive swirling \nstorm system with a well developed eye-wall, similar to a \n<a href=\"ap040915.html\">hurricane here on Earth</a>.  \n\nOne image of the storm is \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08332\">shown above</a>, while several frames from the overpass have been made into a \n<a href=\"http://ciclops.org/media/ir/2006/2313_6310_4.mpg\">movie</a> \nthat shows the \n<a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8112690528797127090\">huge vortex rotating</a>.\n\nThe storm is slightly larger than the entire Earth and carries winds that reach \n550 kilometers per hour, twice the velocity of a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale\">Category 5</a> hurricane.\n\nThis pole vortex on Saturn might have been raging for billions of years \nand is not expected to \n<a href=\"ap040919.html\">drift off</a> the pole.",
