  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOnce known as Earth's <a href=\"ap130316.html\">sunset comet</a>,\nPanSTARRS (C/2011 L4) is up all night now, but\nonly for northern hemisphere skygazers.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=2145.0\">Telescopes\nare required</a> to track\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/weekly/current.html\">its progress</a>\nas it fades and heads for the outer solar system.\n\nBut because planet Earth passed through the comet's orbital\nplane in late May, PanSTARRS will also be remembered for its\n<a href=\"ap130526.html\">remarkably long anti-tail</a>.\n\nThat edge-on perspective looking along the broad,\n<a href=\"ap130330.html\">fanned-out dust tail</a>\nas it trailed behind the comet created the appearance\nof an anti-tail pointing in the sunward direction,\nback toward the inner solar system.\n\nRecorded on the night of May 27, this 13 pane mosaic\n(shown in positive and negative views)\nfollows PanSTARRS' anti-tail as\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/102299/\nwhat-do-comet-panstarrs-and-pinocchio-have-in-common/\">it stretches</a>\nover 7 degrees from the comet's coma at the far right.\n\nThe anti-tail was likely much longer, but gets lost in the evening's\nbright moonlight encroaching on the left edge of the scene.\n\nBackground star cluster NGC 188 in Cepheus shows up\n<a href=\"image/1306/C2011-L4-PANSTARRS_1275.jpg\">along the way</a>,\nnear top left.",
