  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs this the real world?  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ\">Or is it just fantasy</a>? \n\nThe truth started with a dream -- a dream that the spectacular \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljalandsfoss\">Seljarlandsfoss waterfall</a> in southern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a> could be photographed with a backdrop of an \n<a href=\"ap140714.html\">aurora-filled sky</a>. \n\nSoon after a promising \n<a href=\"http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/\">space weather report</a>, the visionary astrophotographer and his partner sprang into action. \n\nAfter arriving, capturing an image of the background sky, complete with a cool green \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/aurora-index.html\">aurora</a>, turned out to be the easy part. \n\nThe hard part was capturing the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrw6Zv9KdI\">waterfall itself</a>, for one reason because mist kept \n<a href=\"http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/cataract_overview_slideshow/getty_rf_blurry_fingers.jpg\">fogging the lens</a>!  \n\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tlzk4yvgz5a5bcf2que3c3s3tyi?lyrics=1\">Easy come, easy go</a> -- \nit took about 100 times where someone had to go back to the camera -- on a cold night and over slippery rocks -- \nto see how the last exposure turned out, wipe the lens, and reset the \n<a href=\"http://www.explainthatstuff.com/digitalcameras.html\">camera</a> for the next try.\n\nLater, the best images of \n<a href=\"ap140519.html\">land and sky</a> were digitally combined. \n\nVisible in the sky, even well behind the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/aurora-image-gallery/index.html\">aurora</a>, are numerous \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">stars</a> of the northern sky.\n\nThe resulting title -- given by the astrophotographer -- was influenced by a \n<a href=\"http://orig03.deviantart.net/43ed/f/2006/341/b/6/dreaming_cat_by_i_am_mad.jpg\">dream-like quality</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/841006502673778/photos/a.841285002645928.1073741829.841006502673778/880491025391992/?type=3&amp;theater\">resulting image</a>, possibly combined with the knowledge that some things really mattered in this effort to make a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream\">dream</a> come true.",
