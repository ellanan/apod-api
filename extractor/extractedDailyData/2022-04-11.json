  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTypically, the International Space Station is visible only at night. \n\nSlowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) can be seen as a \n<a href=\"ap110314.html\">bright spot</a> several times a year from many locations. \n\n<a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/faq.cfm\">The ISS</a> \nis then visible only just after sunset or just before \nsunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- \nonce the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, it will drop out of sight.\n\nThe only occasion when the \n<a href=\"ap160513.html\">ISS is visible during the day</a> is when it \n<a href=\"ap190715.html\">passes right in front of the Sun</a>.\n\nThen, it passes so quickly that only cameras \ntaking short exposures can visually freeze the \n<a href=\"ap150912.html\">ISS's silhouette</a> onto the background \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>.\n\nThe featured picture did exactly that -- \nit is actually a series of images taken earlier this month from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/efHyAyT4Fko\">Beijing</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a> with perfect timing. \n\n\nThis image series was <a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/adopted-cats-sleeping-together-hammock-barnaby-stoche-4.jpg\">later combined</a> with separate images \ntaken at nearly the same time but highlighting the \n<a href=\"ap140312.html\">texture</a> and activity on the busy \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>.\n\nThe solar activity included numerous gaseous \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/what-is-a-solar-prominence\">prominences</a> seen around the edge, highlighted in red, \n<a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/sun-space-weather/solar-filament\">filaments</a> seen against the Sun's face, and a dark \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/\">sunspot</a>.",
