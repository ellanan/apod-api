  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis planet is only 16 light years away -- could it harbor life?\n\nRecently discovered \n<a href=\"http://www.hzgallery.org/\">exoplanet</a>  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_832_c\">Gliese 832c</a> \nhas been found in a close orbit around a star that is less bright than our Sun.  \n\nAn interesting coincidence, however, is that \n<a href=\"http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/system.html?id=Gliese+832\">Gliese 832c</a> receives just about the \n<a href=\"http://cosmicopia.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html#constant\">same average flux</a> from its parent star as does the Earth.\n\nSince the planet was \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5587\">discovered</a> only by a slight wobble in its \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_832\">parent star</a>'s motion, the \n<a href=\"http://phl.upr.edu/press-releases/gliese832\">above illustration</a> \nis just an artistic guess of the planet's appearance -- \nmuch remains unknown about Gliese 832c's true mass, size, and atmosphere.\n\nIf Gliese 832c has an atmosphere like Earth, it may be a \n<a href=\"ap060320.html\">super-Earth</a> undergoing strong seasons but capable of supporting life.\n\nAlternatively, if Gliese 832c has a thick atmosphere like Venus, it may be a \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/images/kepler-69c.html\">super-Venus</a> and so unlikely to support life as we know it.\n\nThe close 16-light year distance makes the Gliese 832 planetary system currently the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_terrestrial_exoplanet_candidates\">nearest to Earth</a> that could potentially support life.\n\nThe proximity of the \n<a href=\"http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/science-gliese832c-potentially-habitable-super-earth-02029.html\">Gliese 832</a> system therefore lends itself to more detailed future examination and, in the most spectacularly optimistic scenario, actual \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Son,_the_Physicist\">communication</a> -- \nwere intelligent life found there.",
