  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWelcome to planet Earth, the third planet from a star named the Sun. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/\">Earth</a> is shaped like a \n<a href=\"https://www.geogebra.org/m/gsXuhRrs\">sphere</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Chemical_composition\">composed</a> mostly of rock. \n\nOver 70 percent of the \n<a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth\">Earth's surface</a> is water. \n\nThe planet has a relatively \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1529.html\">thin atmosphere</a> composed mostly of \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml\">nitrogen</a> and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/blue-marble-image-of-the-earth-from-apollo-17\">featured picture</a> of Earth, dubbed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble\">The Blue Marble</a>, \nwas \n<a href=\"https://apolloinrealtime.org/17/?t=005:49:47\">taken</a> from \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/apollo-17/in-depth/\">Apollo 17</a> in 1972 and features \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica\">Antarctica</a>. \n\nIt is thought to be one of the most \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_history.php\">widely distributed</a> photographs of any kind. \n\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/earth-book-2019\">Earth</a> has a single large \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">Moon</a> \nthat is about 1/4 of its diameter and, \nfrom the planet's surface, is seen to have almost exactly the \n<a href=\"ap160501.html\">same angular size</a> as the Sun. \n\nWith its \n<a href=\"ap160911.html\">abundance of liquid water</a>, \nEarth supports a large \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/big-questions/how-did-life-begin-and-evolve-earth-and-has-it-evolved-elsewhere-solar-system\">variety of life</a> forms, \nincluding potentially intelligent species such as \n<a href=\"https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/how-intelligent-are-whales-and-dolphins/\">dolphins</a> and \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">human</a>s. \n\nPlease <a href=\"https://www.jwj.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/happy-kitten-kittens-5890512-1600-12001-1024x768.jpg\">enjoy your stay</a> on planet Earth.",
