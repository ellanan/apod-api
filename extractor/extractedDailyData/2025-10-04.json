  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nNo one on Earth sees the Moon rotate like this.\n\nThat's because the Moon is tidally locked in\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4709\">synchronous rotation</a>,\nshowing only one side to denizens of our fair planet.\n\nStill, given\n<a href=\"https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2009/01/rand.jpg\">modern digital technology</a>,\ncombined with many detailed images returned by the \n<a href=\"https://www.lroc.asu.edu/about\">Lunar Reconnaissance\nOrbiter</a> (LRO), a high resolution virtual \n<a href=\"https://www.lroc.asu.edu/images/707\">Moon rotation movie</a> \ncan be composed.\n\nIn fact, the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUNB6CMnE8\">featured time-lapse video</a>\nstarts with a view of the\n<a href=\"ap250720.html\">familiar lunar nearside</a> and quickly finds the\n<a href=\"ap110312.html\">Mare Orientale</a>, a large crater with a dark\ncenter that is difficult to see from the Earth,\nrotating into view just below the equator.  \n\nIn a complete lunar rotation\ncondensed into 24 seconds, the video clearly shows that the Earth-facing\nnearside of\n<a href=\"ap220612.html\">the Moon</a> contains an abundance of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maria_on_the_Moon\">dark lunar maria</a>, \nwhile the lunar farside is dominated by bright \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon#Highlands\">lunar highlands</a>.\n\nOf course, you can just join other <a href=\"ap211010.html\">moon-watchers</a>\nunder hopefully clear skies tonight.\n\nCheck out the sunlit portion of the lunar nearside on \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/\">International Observe the Moon Night</a>.",
