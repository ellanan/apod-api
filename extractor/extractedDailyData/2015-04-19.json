  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow could a galaxy become shaped like a ring?  The rim of the blue galaxy \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/15/caption.html\">pictured</a> on the right is an immense ring-like structure 150,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, \nmassive stars.  \n\nThat galaxy, <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...474..686H\">AM 0644-741</a>, is known as a \n\n<a href=\"ap010612.html\">ring galaxy</a> and was caused by an \nimmense galaxy collision.  \n\nWhen <a href=\"ap150201.html\">galaxies collide</a>, \nthey pass through each other -- their individual stars \nrarely come into contact.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement_ring\">ring</a>-like shape is the result of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force\">gravitational disruption</a> \ncaused by an entire \n<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5b/60/1e/5b601e8413f01f169a27dffd3a1e1601.jpg\">small intruder</a> galaxy passing through a large one.  \n\nWhen this happens, interstellar gas and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> become condensed, causing a \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/density+wave+model\">wave of star formation</a> \nto move out from the impact point like a \nripple across the surface of a pond.  \n\nThe intruder galaxy is just outside of the frame taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2004/15/image/a/\">featured image</a> was taken to \n<a href=\"http://hubble25th.org/\">commemorate the anniversary</a> of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on7_7WZmdgI\">Hubble's launch</a> \nin 1990.\n\n<a href=\"ap020909.html\">Ring galaxy</a> AM 0644-741 lies about 300 million light years away.",
