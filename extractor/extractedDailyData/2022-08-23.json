  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCareful planning made this a nightscape to remember.\n\nFirst, the night itself was chosen to occur during the beginning of this year's \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>. \n\nNext, the time of night was chosen to be before the \n<a href=\"ap200224.html\">bright Moon</a> would rise and \ndominate the \n<a href=\"ap200408.html\">night sky's brightness</a>.\n\nThe picturesque foreground was selected to be a rocky beach of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a> in \nLe Dramont, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>, with, at the time, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele_d%27Or\">île d’Or</a> \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GpZdB75AjkU\">island</a> \nsituated near the ominously descending central band of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way</a> \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/galaxy/en/\">Galaxy</a>. \n\nOnce everything was set and with the weather cooperating, all of the frames for \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/julienlooten/52285520553/in/datetaken-public/\">this seemingly surreal nightscape</a> were acquired within 15 minutes.\n\nWhat you <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0371/9753/articles/zx7seunaq4dakrrjiccc_1044x.jpg\">can't see</a> is that, on this night, \nthe astrophotographer brought along his father who, \nalthough unskilled in modern sky-capture techniques, \nonce made it a point to \n<a href=\"https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/\">teach his child about the sky</a>.",
