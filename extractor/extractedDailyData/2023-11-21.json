  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThese chaotic and tangled filaments of shocked, glowing gas are spread across\nplanet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus as part of the\n<a href=\"ap220622.html\">Veil Nebula</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_Nebula\">Veil Nebula</a> itself is a large\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a>, an expanding\ncloud born of the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nLight from the original supernova explosion likely reached\nEarth over 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....122..938D/abstract\">glowing filaments</a> are really more like long ripples in a sheet seen\nalmost edge on, remarkably well separated into\nthe glow of ionized hydrogen atoms shown in red and oxygen in blue hues.\n\nAlso known as the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3MJChWEmtUw\">Cygnus Loop</a> and cataloged as \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/vk0_PYyzvm8\">NGC 6979</a>, the\n<a href=\"http://archive.stsci.edu/fuse/scisumm/sci_cyglpstar.html\">Veil Nebula now spans</a> about 6 times the diameter of the \n<a href=\"ap140113.html\">full Moon</a>.\n\nThe length of the wisp corresponds to about 30 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a>, \ngiven its estimated distance of 2,400 light years. \n\nOften identified as Pickering's Triangle\nfor a director of \n<a href=\"https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Observatory/newest.html\">Harvard College Observatory</a>, it \nis perhaps better named for its discoverer,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming\">astronomer Williamina Fleming</a>, as\n<a href=\"http://www.davidcortner.com/slowblog/20161113.php\">Fleming's\nTriangular Wisp</a>.",
