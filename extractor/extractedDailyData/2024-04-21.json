  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWatch Juno zoom past Jupiter. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s robotic spacecraft \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno\">Juno</a> \nis continuing on its now month-long, \nhighly-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit\">elongated orbits</a> around our Solar System's largest planet. \n\nThe featured video is from perijove 16, the sixteenth time that \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/\">Juno</a> \npassed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016.\n\nEach <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/perijove\">perijove</a> passes near a \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-re-plans-junos-jupiter-mission\">slightly different part</a> of Jupiter's cloud tops. \n\nThis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGW2JZrMnY\">color-enhanced video</a> has been digitally composed from 21 JunoCam still images, resulting in a 125-fold time-lapse.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/c4TU3arrZR8\">The video</a> begins with Jupiter rising as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">Juno</a> \n<a href=\"ap170523.html\">approaches</a> from the north.\n\nAs Juno reaches its \n<a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/1050MHNmEr19C0/giphy.gif\">closest view</a> -- from about 3,500 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/\">Juno</a> passes light zones and dark belts of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than \n<a href=\"ap171127.html\">hurricanes on Earth</a>. \n\nAs Juno moves away, the remarkable \n<a href=\"ap190415.html\">dolphin-shaped cloud</a> is visible. \n\nAfter the perijove, \n<a href=\"ap220830.html\">Jupiter</a> recedes into the distance, now displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter's south. \n\nTo get desired \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/science-findings/\">science data</a>, Juno swoops so close to \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>\nthat its instruments are exposed to very high levels of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/\">radiation</a>.",
