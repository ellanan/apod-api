  "title": "Night Hides the World",
  "explanation": "Stars come out as evening twilight fades in this serene skyscape following the Persian proverb \"Night hides the world, but reveals a universe.\" In the scene from last November, the Sun is setting over northern Kenya and the night will soon hide the shores of Lake Turkana, home to many Nile crocodiles. That region is also known as the cradle of humankind for its abundance of hominid fossils. A brilliant Venus, then the world's evening star, dominates the starry night above. But also revealed are faint stars, cosmic dust clouds, and glowing nebulae along the graceful arc of our own Milky Way galaxy.",
