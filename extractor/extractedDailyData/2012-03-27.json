  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those unusual features on planet Mercury?\n\nThe slightly bluish tinge of features dubbed hollows has been exaggerated on the above image by the robotic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER spacecraft</a> currently\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVVerBya6l4\">orbiting Mercury</a>.\n\nThe rounded depressions appear different than impact craters and nothing like them has been noted on\n<a href=\"ap021029.html\">Earth's Moon</a> or anywhere else in the\n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Solar System</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14856\">above image</a> is a section of the floor of\nRaditladi\n<a href=\"ap091007.html\">impact basin</a> about 40 kilometers wide that includes the mountains of the central peak.  \n\nOne <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Sci...333.1856B\">progenitor hypothesis</a> is that the hollows formed from the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)\">sublimation</a> of\n<a href=\"ap110926.html\">material exposed</a>\nand heated during the violent impact that created the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raditladi_Basin\">Raditladi basin</a>.\n\nNASA's <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/\nmain/index.html\">MESSENGER</a>\nis the first spacecraft ever to orbit Mercury, and is\n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/\ndetails.php?id=188\">currently scheduled</a>\nto explore the Solar System's innermost planet into 2013.",
