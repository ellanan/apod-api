  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs the Helix Nebula looking at you?\n\nNo, not in any biological sense, but it does look quite like an eye.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_Nebula\">Helix Nebula</a> is so named because it also appears \nthat you are looking down the axis of a \n<a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Helix.html\">helix</a>.\n\nIn actuality, it is now understood to have a surprisingly\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/image/1605/news_release/2004-32\">complex geometry</a>, including radial filaments and extended \n<a href=\"ap180103.html\">outer loops</a>. \n\nThe Helix Nebula (<a href=\"https://grammarist.com/acronym/a-k-a-or-aka/\">aka</a> NGC 7293) is one of brightest and closest examples of a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>, a gas\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXNSYo8ZdoU\">cloud created</a> at the end of the life of a Sun-like star.\n\nThe remnant central stellar core, destined to become a <a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html\">white dwarf star</a>, glows in light so\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">energetic</a> \nit causes the previously expelled gas to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvN8zFhWn04\">fluoresce</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/378608/C/\">featured picture</a>, \ntaken in the light emitted by \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a> (shown in blue) and \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomyknowhow.com/hydrogen-alpha.htm\">hydrogen</a> (shown in red), was created from 74 hours of exposure over three months from a small telescope in a backyard of suburban \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxRa7czldw0\">Melbourne</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>. \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwAKNMC2PeM\">close-up</a> of the\n<a href=\"ap080413.html\">inner edge</a> of the Helix Nebula \nshows complex gas knots of\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...573L..55H\">unknown origin</a>.",
