  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are these two giant arches across the sky?\n\nPerhaps the more familiar one, on the left, is the central band of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nThis grand disk of stars and nebulas here appears to encircle much of the southern sky.\n\nVisible below the stellar arch is the \n<a href=\"ap970804.html\">rusty-orange</a> planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> and the extended \n<a href=\"ap150830.html\">Andromeda galaxy</a>.\n\nFor a few minutes during this \n<a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DKSyMr2UEAAUL70?format=jpg\">cold</a>\narctic night, a second \n<a href=\"ap200531.html\">giant arch</a> appeared to the right, \nencircling part of the northern sky: an \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/\">aurora</a>.\n\nAuroras are much closer than stars as they are composed of glowing air high in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nVisible outside the \n<a href=\"ap190322.html\">green auroral arch</a> is the group of stars popularly \n<a href=\"ap210112.html\">known</a> as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper\">Big Dipper</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://giuliocobianchi.com/gallery/capture-the-night/\">featured digital composite</a> of 18 images was captured in mid-December over the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mg67iIFivDo\">Lofoten Islands</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a>.",
