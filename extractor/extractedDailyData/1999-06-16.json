  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes lightning occurs out near space.  \nOne such \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/0897issue/0897mende.html\">lightning type</a> is the recently documented \n<a href=\"http://sprite.gi.alaska.edu/html/sprites.htm\">red sprite lightning</a>, which has\nonly been photographed and studied on \n<a href=\"ap990131.html\">Earth</a> over the last few years.  \n\nThe origins of all types of <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/96/lightning/2.html\">lightning</a> remains unknown, \nand scientists are even trying to figure out why <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/explorations/012097sprites/012097explorations.html\">red sprite lightning</a> occurs at all.  \n\nWhat is known is that as some large, \npositive cloud-to-ground lightning strokes occur, \nmillisecond <a href=\"http://sprite.gi.alaska.edu/exl98/animated_gif_sequence_of_a_sprit.htm\">flashes appearing</a> red may also occur far above in the upper\n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/home.rxml\">atmosphere</a>.  \n\nPictured <a href=\"http://sprite.gi.alaska.edu/EXL98/images/a_gallery_of_some_interesting_sp.htm\">above</a>, a group of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd10jun99_1.htm\">red sprites</a> was photographed at high resolution.  \nReasons for the observed complexities are being researched.",
