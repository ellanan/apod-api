  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSixty million light-years away toward the southerly constellation Corvus,\nthese <a href=\"ap120604.html\">two large galaxies are colliding</a>.\n\nThe cosmic train wreck captured in stunning detail in this\n<a href=\"https://spacetelescope.org/images/potw1345a/\">Hubble Space Telescope snapshot</a>\ntakes hundreds of millions of years to play out.\n\nCataloged as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, the galaxies' individual stars don't\noften collide though.\n\nTheir large clouds of molecular gas and dust do,\ntriggering furious episodes of star formation near the center of\nthe wreckage.\n\nNew star clusters and interstellar matter are jumbled and\nflung far from the scene of the accident by gravitational forces.\n\nThis Hubble close-up frame is about 50,000 light-years across\nat the estimated distance of the colliding galaxies.\n\nIn wider-field views their suggestive visual appearance,\nwith extended structures arcing for hundreds of thousands of\nlight-years, gives the galaxy pair its popular name,\n<a href=\"ap170428.html\">The Antennae Galaxies</a>.",
