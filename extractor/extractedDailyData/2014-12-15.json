  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy do some places on Earth have higher gravity than others?  \n\nSometimes the reason is unknown.  \n\nTo help better understand the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Interior_Structure/surface.html\">Earth's surface</a>, sensitive measurements by the orbiting satellites  \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/missions/grace/\">GRACE</a> and \n<a href=\" http://science.nasa.gov/missions/champ\">CHAMP</a> \nwere used to create a map of Earth's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth\">gravitational field</a>.  \n\nSince a center for studying these data is in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam\">Potsdam</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>, and since the result makes the Earth look somewhat like a potato, the resulting geoid has been referred to as the Potsdam Gravity Potato. \n\nHigh areas on <a href=\"http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/media-communication/image-galleries/geoid-the-potsdam-gravity-potato/\">this map</a>, colored red, indicate areas where gravity is \nslightly stronger than usual, while in blue areas gravity is\nslightly weaker.\n\nMany bumps and valleys on the Potsdam Gravity Potato can be \nattributed to surface features, such as the \n<a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge\">North\nMid-Atlantic Ridge</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap020723.html\">Himalayan Mountains</a>, \nbut others cannot, and so might relate to unusually \nhigh or low sub-surface densities.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04652\">Maps\nlike this</a> also help calibrate changes in the \nEarth's surface including \n<a href=\"ap980113.html\">variable ocean currents</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap090215.html\">melting of glaciers</a>.\n\nThe above map was made in 2005, but more recent and more sensitive \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik8FNwPlf3U\">gravity map</a>s \nof Earth were produced in <a href=\" http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/media-communication/image-galleries/geoid-the-potsdam-gravity-potato/\">2011</a>.",
