  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTwice a year, at the Spring and Fall <a href=\"ap010320.html\">equinox</a>,\nthe Sun rises due east.\n\nIn an emphatic demonstration of this\n<a href=\"http://www.wam.umd.edu/~tlaloc/archastro/\">celestial alignment</a>,\nphotographer Joe Orman recorded this\n<a href=\"http://pages.prodigy.net/pam.orman/\nJoeGallery.html\">inspiring image of</a> the Sun rising\nexactly along the east-west oriented Western Canal, in Tempe,\nArizona, USA.\n\nBut he waited until March 21st, one day <i>after</i> the equinox, to\nphotograph the striking view.\n\nWhy was the rising Sun due east one day after the equinox?\n\nAt Tempe's latitude the Sun rises\n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Classroom/Lessons/\nSundials/equinox.html\">at an angle</a>, arcing southward as\nit climbs above the horizon.\n\nBecause the distant mountains hide the true horizon, the Sun shifts\nslightly southward by the time it clears the\n<a href=\"ap990902.html\">mountain tops</a>.\n\nWaiting 24 hours\n<a href=\"http://www.nsta.org/programs/sst/aws/aws.htm\">allowed the Sun</a>\nto rise just north\nof east and arc back to an exactly eastern alignment for the photo.\n\nOrman also notes that this picture carries a special significance as\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/\">we experience</a> the maximum of the\n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/outreach/\nsolarmax/\">solar activity cycle</a>.\n\nThe electricity and telephone transmission lines along the canal symbolize\npower and communications grids which are most vulnerable\nto <a href=\"http://sec.noaa.gov/advisories\">outbursts from</a>\nthe active Sun.",
