  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow does a comet tail change?\n\nIt depends on the comet. \n\nThe ion tail of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks\">Comet 12P/Pons–Brooks</a> has been changing markedly, \nas detailed in the featured image sequenced over nine days \nfrom March 6 to 14 (top to bottom). \n\nOn some days, the comet's \n<a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a> was relatively long and complex, \nbut not every day. \n\nReasons for tail changes include the rate of \n<a href=\"ap151118.html\">ejection of material</a> from the \n<a href=\"https://www.cometcampaign.org/files/images/comets_spacecraft.jpg\">comet's nucleus</a>, \nthe strength and complexity of the \n<a href=\"ap240219.html\">passing solar wind</a>, and the \n<a href=\"ap240318.html\">rotation rate</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/\">comet</a>. \n\nOver the course of a week, apparent changes even include a \nchange of perspective from the Earth.\n\nIn general, a comet's \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/anatomy-of-a-comet.en.jpg\">ion tail will point away from the Sun</a>, \nas gas expelled is pushed out by the \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">Sun's wind</a>.\n\nToday, \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/12-p-comet-pons-brooks-outburst-millennium-falcon-bright-2024-eclipse/\">Pons-Brooks</a> may become a rare comet \n<a href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/5613/15634745431_af629b9374.jpg\">suddenly visible</a> in the middle of the day for those able to see the \n<a href=\"ap170820.html\">Sun totally eclipsed by the Moon</a>.",
