  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those bright objects hovering over the horizon?\n\nPlanets -- and the Moon. \n\nFirst out, the horizon featured is a shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean that occurs at the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Islands_of_Galicia_National_Park\">Galicia National Park</a> in northern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nNext furthest out, on the left, is the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Moon\">Moon</a>.\n\nEasily the brightest object on the night sky, the \n<a href=\" http://moon.nasa.gov/\">Moon</a> \nhere was in only a \n<a href=\"ap130414.html\">crescent phase</a>.\n\nThe next furthest out, on the right, is the planet \n<a href=\"ap140817.html\">Venus, while planet Jupiter</a> \nis seen at the top of the triangle. \n\nThe long exposure from our rapidly rotating Earth made all of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjunctions_(astronomy)#2015\">celestial objects</a> -- including the far distant stars -- appear as slight \n<a href=\"ap140317.html\">arcs</a>. \n\nThe featured image was taken last Sunday night.\n\nAlthough the Moon's orbit has now taken it away from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ppuCZR8Mkw\">this part of the sky</a>, the planets \n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/press-releases/venus-and-jupiter-june-2015/\">Venus and Jupiter can be seen superposed</a> just after \n<a href=\"http://cache.desktopnexus.com/thumbseg/109/109977-bigthumbnail.jpg\">sunset</a> until mid-August. \n\nThe closest apparent separation of \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/?p=173537\">Venus and Jupiter</a> \nwill occur in one week, when the \n<a href=\"ap140821.html\">two planets</a> will appear \nseparated by less than the angular diameter of the Moon.",
