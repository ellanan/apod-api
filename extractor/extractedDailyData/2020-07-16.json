  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) now sweeps through\n<a href=\"ap200715.html\">our fair planet's northern skies</a>.\n\nIts\n<a href=\"http://spaceguard.rm.iasf.cnr.it/NScience/neo/neo-what/com-tail.htm\">long tails</a>\nstretch across this deep skyview from Suchy Vrch, Czech Republic.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.astronom.cz/horalek/?p=6546\">Recorded on the night of July 13/14</a>,\nthe composite of untracked foreground\nand tracked and filtered sky exposures\nteases out details in the comet's tail not visible to the\nunaided eye.\n\nFaint structures extend to the top of the frame,\nover 20 degrees from the comet's bright coma.\n\nPushed out by the pressure of\nsunlight itself, the broad curve of the comet's yellowish \ndust tail is easy to see by eye.\n\nBut the fainter, more bluish tail is separate from the\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-parker-solar-probe-spies-newly-discovered-comet-neowise/\">reflective\ncomet dust</a>.\n\nThe fainter tail is an ion tail, formed as ions from the\ncometary coma are dragged outward by magnetic fields in the solar wind\nand fluoresce in the sunlight.\n\nOutbound\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-to-see-comet-neowise\">NEOWISE is climbing higher in northern evening skies</a>,\ncoming closest to Earth on July 23rd.",
