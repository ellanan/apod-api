  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhen does the Sun look like a flower? \n\nIn a specific color of red light emitted by hydrogen, as \n<a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/winterrose.html\">featured here</a>, some regions of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosphere\">solar chromosphere</a> may resemble a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhyoza_VfH8#t=30s\">rose</a>. \n\nThe color-inverted image was taken in 2014 October and shows \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=02&amp;month=10&amp;year=2014\">active solar region 2177</a>. \n\nThe petals dominating the frame are actually magnetically confined tubes of hot \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast07sep99_1/\">plasma</a> called \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...759...18P\">fibrils</a>, \nsome of which extend longer than the diameter of the Earth. \n\nIn the central \n<a href=\"http://www.solarmonitor.org/index.php?date=20141005&amp;region=12177\">region</a> many of these fibrils are seen end-on, while the surrounding regions are typically populated with curved fibrils. \n\nWhen seen over the Sun's edge, these huge plasma tubes are called \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spicule_(solar_physics)\">spicules</a>, \nand when they occur in passive regions they are termed \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702081\">mottles</a>. \n\nSunspot \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceTMgEr5_b4\">region 2177 survived for several more days</a> before the complex and tumultuous \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml\">magnetic field</a> \npoking through the \n<a href=\"ap111106.html\">Sun's surface evolved</a> yet again.",
