  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are there so many cyclones around the north pole of Jupiter?\n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/347/nasa-juno-findings-jupiters-jet-streams-are-unearthly/\">The topic</a> is still being researched. \n\nNASA's robotic <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/\">Juno mission</a> orbiting Jupiter \ntook data in 2018 that was used to construct \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22335\">this stunning view</a> of the curious cyclones at\nJupiter's north pole.\n\nMeasuring the \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/lj1x1o/thermal_cat/#lightbox\">thermal emission</a> from Jovian cloud tops, the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/\">infrared</a> observations are not restricted to the\n<a href=\"ap160914.html\">hemisphere illuminated</a> by sunlight.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25491\">They reveal</a>\neight cyclonic features that surround\na cyclone about 4,000 kilometers in diameter,\njust offset from the giant planet's geographic north pole.\n\nSimilar data show a cyclone at the \n<a href=\"ap161025.html\">Jovian south pole</a>\nwith five circumpolar cyclones.\n\nThe south pole cyclones are slightly larger than their northern\ncousins.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mYiRh.png\">Oddly</a>, \ndata from the once Saturn-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/about-the-mission/\">Cassini mission</a> has shown that Saturn's \n<a href=\"ap250223.html\">north</a> and \n<a href=\"ap081027.html\">south pole</a>s each have only a single cyclonic\n<a href=\"ap130502.html\">storm system</a>.",
