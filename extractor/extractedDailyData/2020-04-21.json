  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever had \n<a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/stars-in-one-s-eyes--have\">stars in your eyes</a>?\n\nIt appears that the eye on the left does, and moreover it appears to be gazing at even more stars.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.miguelclaro.com/wp/portfolio/from-ojos-del-salar-a-martian-eye-looks-deep-into-our-milky-way-galaxy/\">featured 27-frame mosaic</a> was taken last July from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KQv2h1jEN2s?t=66\">Ojas de Salar</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj7nxSCVG9Y\">Atacama Desert</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>. \n\nThe eye is actually a small \n<a href=\"ap191104.html\">lagoon</a> captured reflecting the \n<a href=\"ap200408.html\">dark night sky</a> as the Milky Way Galaxy arched overhead.\n\nThe seemingly smooth band of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way</a> is really composed of billions of stars, but decorated with filaments of light-absorbing dust and \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html\">red-glowing nebulas</a>.\n\nAdditionally, both \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> \n(slightly left the galactic arch) and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> \n(slightly to the right) are visible. \n\nThe lights of small towns dot the unusual vertical horizon. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap161005.html\">rocky terrain</a> around the \nlagoon appears to some more like the surface of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> than our \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-marks-earth-day-s-50th-anniversary-with-earthdayathome\">Earth</a>.",
