  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis pretty field of view spans over 2 degrees\nor 4 full moons on the sky,\nfilled with stars toward the constellation Taurus, the Bull.\n\nAbove and right of center in the frame you can spot the faint fuzzy reddish\nappearance of Messier 1 (M1),\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-1-the-crab-nebula\">also known as the Crab Nebula</a>.\n\nM1 is the first object in 18th century comet hunter\nCharles Messier's famous catalog of things which are\ndefinitely <i>not</i> comets.\n\nMade from image data captured this October 11,\nthere is a comet in the picture though.\n\nBelow center and left lies the faint greenish coma and dusty\ntail of periodic comet\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>,\nalso known as Rosetta's comet.\n\nIn the 21st century, it became the\nfinal resting place of\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/rosetta-philae/in-depth/\">robots from planet Earth</a>.\n\nRosetta's comet is\n<a href=\"ap210910.html\">now returning</a> to the inner solar system, sweeping\ntoward its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun, on November 2.\n\n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/67p-info\">Too faint to be seen</a>\nby eye alone, the comet's next perigee or closest\napproach to Earth will be November 12.",
