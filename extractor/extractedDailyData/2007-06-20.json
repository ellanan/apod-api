  "title": "A Daylight Eclipse of Venus",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSomething was about to happen.  \n\nJust two days ago, two of the three celestial objects easily visible during the day appeared to collide.  \n\nBut actually, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\">Earth's Moon</a> \npassed well in front of the distant \n<a href=\"ap070501.html\">planet Venus</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/eclipses/gallery_18jun07_page2.htm\">occultation</a> was caught from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland\">Switzerland</a> \nin the hours before \n<a href=\"ap050620.html\">sunset</a>.\n\nMoments after this image was taken, the Moon, visible as the crescent on the right of the \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/eclipses/18jun07b/Heinzen1.jpg\">above image</a>, \n<a href=\"ap061030.html\">eclipsed Venus</a>, appearing near\n<a href=\"http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/moon/Phases.shtml\">half phase</a> on the lower left.   \n\n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cld/cldtyp/home.rxml\">Clouds</a> that once threatened to obscure the \n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/7957837.html\">whole event</a>, were visible on the far left.  \n\nAbout \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co31wxGosN4\">90 minutes</a> later, \nVenus re-appeared just to the right of the \n<a href=\"ap060618.html\">bright crescent</a>.",
