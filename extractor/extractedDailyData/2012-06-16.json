  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950616.html\">first APOD</a> appeared seventeen years ago today, on 1995 June 16.  \n\nAlthough garnering only 14 page views on that day, \n<a href=\"ap050616.html\">we</a> are proud to estimate that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APOD\">APOD</a> has now\nserved over one billion space-related images over the last 1.7 decades.  \n\nThat early beginning, along with a nearly unchanging format, has allowed \nAPOD to be a consistent and familiar site on a web frequently filled with\nchange.   \n\nMany people don't know, though, that APOD is now \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">translated daily</a> into many major languages and featured on \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html#newmedia\">social\nmedia</a> sites and smartphone applications.\n\nWe again thank our \n<a href=\"http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/\n3-quarks-daily-2012-science-prize-vote-here-.html\">readers</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> \nfor their continued support, as well as\nthe folks who created the great pictures -- many times with considerable\neffort -- that APOD has been fortunate enough to feature over the years.  \n\nMany can be contacted by following links found in the credit line\nunder the image.  \n\nToday's birthday collage includes numerous galaxies captured by the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/\">Hubble\nSpace Telescope</a>.",
