  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLight emitted by a planet far beyond \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">our Solar System</a> \nhas been identified for the first time.  \n\nThe planet, illustrated in the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2005-09/release.shtml\">above drawing</a>, had its light detected by comparing \nthe brightness of only the parent star, \nwhen the planet was \n<a href=\"ap031208.html\">behind</a> the star, \nto the light emitted when both the \n<a href=\"ap011128.html\">planet</a> and its parent star were visible.   \n\nThe Earth-<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/orbit.shtml\">trailing</a> <a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> made the observation in \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a>, where the intrinsic glow of the \nplanet outshines the light it reflects from its central star.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503457\">direct observation</a> \nof light allowed a measurement of both the temperature and \nsize of the planet: \n<a href=\"http://www.obspm.fr/encycl/HD209458.html\">HD 209458</a>b.  \n\nPlanet HD 209458b was confirmed to be larger than expected \nfor its mass and on an orbit around its \nparent star that was unexpectedly close to a \n<a href=\"http://www.engr.umd.edu/HAMLET/MohrsCircle/\">circle</a>.",
