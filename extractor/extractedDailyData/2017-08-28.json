  "title": "A Fleeting Double Eclipse of the Sun",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nLast week, for a fraction of a second, the Sun was eclipsed twice.\n\nOne week ago today, many people in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a> \nwere treated to a standard, single, \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eclipsesHOW.png\">partial solar eclipse</a>.\n\nFewer people, all congregated along a narrow path, experienced the \n<a href=\"ap170820.html\">eerie daytime darkness</a> of a total solar eclipse. \n\nA dedicated few with fast enough camera equipment, however, were able to capture a \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/36670875426/in/album-72157685363271303/\">double eclipse</a> -- a simultaneous partial eclipse of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun\">Sun</a> by both the \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/about.cfm\">Moon</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap151109.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS).\n\nThe Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"ap150427.html\">ISS</a> crossed the Sun in less than a second, but to keep the \n<a href=\"ap161105.html\">ISS</a> from appearing \n<a href=\"http://funny-pics.co/wp-content/uploads/Funny-blurred-image.jpg\">blurry</a>, exposure times must be less than 1/1000th of a second.\n\nThe featured image composite captured the \n<a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\">ISS</a> \nmultiple times in succession as it zipped across the \n<a href=\"ap160513.html\">face of the Sun</a>.\n\nThe picture was taken from Huron, California in a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">specific color</a> \nemitted by \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> which highlights the \n<a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml\">Sun's chromosphere</a>, \na layer hotter and higher up than the usually photographed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere\">photosphere</a>.",
