  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was a very unusual type of solar eclipse.  \n\nTypically, it is the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\">Earth's Moon</a> that \n<a href=\"http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/SolarEclipsesGoogleMaps.html\">eclipses</a> the Sun.  \n\nIn 2012, though, the planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">Venus</a> took a turn.  \n\nLike a <a href=\"ap121117.html\">solar eclipse</a> by the Moon, the \n<a href=\"ap240108.html\">phase of Venus</a> became a continually thinner \n<a href=\"ap210725.html\">crescent</a> as Venus became increasingly better \n<a href=\"https://www.lifewithcats.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yhkjnmkjhgfdge.jpg\">aligned</a> with the Sun.  \n\nEventually the alignment became perfect and the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/\">phase</a> of Venus dropped to zero.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap120611.html\">dark spot</a> of Venus crossed our parent star.  \n\nThe situation could technically be labeled a Venusian \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-an-eclipse-58\">annular eclipse</a> with an extraordinarily large \n<a href=\"ap200615.html\">ring of fire</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pldove/7344307970/in/photostream/\">Pictured here</a> during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>, \nwith the dark region toward the right corresponding to a \n<a href=\"ap100828.html\">coronal hole</a>.\n\nHours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a \n<a href=\"ap130814.html\">slight crescent phase</a> appeared again. \n\nThe next <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus#Past_and_future_transits\">Venusian transit across the Sun</a> will occur in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_century#Transits_and_occultations\">2117</a>.",
