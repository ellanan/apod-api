  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does the Andromeda galaxy look like in ultraviolet light?\n\nYoung blue stars circling the galactic center dominate. \n\nA mere 2.5 million light-years away, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, also\nknown as M31, really is just next door as large galaxies go.\n\n<a href=\"ap200925.html\">Spanning</a>\nabout 230,000 light-years, it took 11 different image fields from NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/galex/galex20120516.html\">Galaxy Evolution Explorer</a> (GALEX) satellite\ntelescope to produce this gorgeous portrait of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral galaxy</a> in\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">\nultraviolet light</a> in 2003.\n\nWhile its spiral arms stand out in\n<a href=\"ap181217.html\">visible light images</a>,\nAndromeda's arms look more like \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10485\">rings in ultraviolet</a>.\n\nThe rings are sites of intense \n<a href=\"https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2019.00092\">star formation</a> and have been interpreted as\nevidence that Andromeda collided with its smaller neighboring \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-32\">elliptical galaxy M32</a> more than 200 million years ago.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap200426.html\">Andromeda galaxy</a> and our own comparable \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way galaxy</a> are the most massive members of the\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/localgr.html\">Local Group</a>\nof galaxies and are \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.386..461C/abstract\">projected to collide</a> in several billion years -- perhaps \naround the time that our Sun's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth\">atmosphere will expand</a> \nto \n<a href=\"https://photobest1.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Funny-Cats-wallpaper-backgrounds-images-09.jpg\">engulf the Earth</a>.",
