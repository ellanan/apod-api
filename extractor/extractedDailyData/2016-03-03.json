  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSome of the Solar System's largest moons rose together\non February 23.\n\nOn that night, a twilight pairing of a waning gibbous Moon\nand Jupiter was captured in this sharp\n<a href=\"http://www.billionplanetsquest.com/p/\ncapernicus-crater-with-scp900nc-philips.html\">telescopic field of view</a>.\n\nThe composite of short and long exposures reveals the familiar\nface of our fair planet's own large natural satellite, along\nwith a line up of the ruling gas giant's four Galilean moons.\n\nLeft to right, the tiny pinpricks of light are\n<a href=\"ap020120.html\">Callisto</a>,\n<a href=\"ap120408.html\">Io</a>,\n<a href=\"ap090920.html\">Ganymede</a>, [Jupiter], and\n<a href=\"ap141127.html\">Europa</a>.\n\nCloser and brighter, our own natural satellite appears to loom large.\n\nBut Callisto, Io, and Ganymede are actually larger than Earth's Moon,\nwhile <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/subject/3148/europa/\">water\nworld Europa</a> is only slightly smaller. \n\nIn fact, of the Solar System's six\n<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/moons.htm\">largest\nplanetary satellites</a>, only Saturn's moon Titan is missing\nfrom the scene.\n\n(<i>Editor's note:</i> Composite corrected for orientation and field of\nview posted on March 7.)",
