  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but can your rainbow do this? \n\nAfter the remnants of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/hurricane-florence\">Hurricane Florence</a> passed over the\nJersey Shore, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey\">New Jersey</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> last month, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> came out in one direction but something quite \nunusual appeared in the opposite direction: a \n<a href=\"ap100504.html\">hall</a> of \n<a href=\"ap100807.html\">rainbows</a>. \n\nOver the course of a next half hour, \nto the delight of the photographer and his daughter, vibrant \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supers.htm\">supernumerary rainbows</a> faded in and out, with at least \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b3/70/3f/b3703f3c9b83bf4ffa1f75294695795a.jpg\">five captured</a> in this featured single shot. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow#Supernumerary\">Supernumerary rainbows</a> only form when falling \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supdrsz.htm\">water droplets are all nearly the same size</a> \nand typically less than a millimeter across. \n\nThen, sunlight will \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supform.htm\">not only reflect</a> from inside the raindrops, but \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference\">interfere</a>, \na wave phenomenon similar to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9QwiBFN9gI\">ripples on a pond</a> \nwhen a stone is thrown in.\n\nIn fact, \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fza82.htm\">supernumerary rainbows</a> \ncan <i> only </i> be explained with waves, \nand their noted existence in the early 1800s was considered early evidence of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRBfpBPELmE\">light's wave nature</a>.",
