  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMars has two tiny moons, Phobos and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimos_(moon)\">Deimos</a>,\nnamed for the figures in Greek mythology Fear and Panic.\n\nDetailed surface views of smaller moon Deimos are shown\nin both these panels.\n\nThe\n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11826\">images were taken in 2009</a>,\nby the HiRISE camera on board the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>\nspacecraft, NASA's long-lived\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/programs/mars-exploration/mars-relay-network-interplanetary-internet/\">interplanetary internet</a>\nsatellite.\n\nThe outermost of the two Martian moons,\nDeimos is one of the smallest known moons in the \nSolar System, measuring only about 15 kilometers across. \n\nBoth Martian moons were discovered in 1877 by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaph_Hall\">Asaph Hall</a>, \nan American astronomer working at the \nUS Naval Observatory in Washington D.C.\n\nBut their existence was postulated around 1610 by \n<a href=\"ap180515.html\">Johannes Kepler</a>, \nthe astronomer who derived the laws of planetary motion.\n\nIn this case, Kepler's prediction\nwas not based on scientific principles, but\nhis writings and ideas were so influential that the two Martian moons\nare discussed in works of fiction such as \n<a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/swift/bio.html\">Jonathan Swift</a>'s \nGulliver's Travels, \nwritten in 1726, over 150 years before their discovery.",
