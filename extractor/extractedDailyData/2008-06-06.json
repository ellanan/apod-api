  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap080104.html\">Gazing out</a> from within\nthe Milky Way, our own galaxy's true structure is difficult to discern.\n\nBut an\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2008-10/\nrelease.shtml\">ambitious survey effort</a> with the\n<a href=\"ap080605.html\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> now\noffers convincing evidence\nthat we live in a large galaxy distinguished by two main\n<a href=\"ap080517.html\">spiral</a> arms\n(the Scutum-Centaurus and Perseus arms)\nemerging from the ends of a large central bar.\n\nIn fact, from a vantage point that viewed our galaxy\n<a href=\"ap040410.html\">face-on</a>,\nastronomers in distant galaxies\nwould likely see\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw_type.html\">the Milky Way\nas</a> a two-armed <a href=\"ap070418.html\">barred spiral</a>\nsimilar to this\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2008-10/\nvisuals.shtml\">artist's illustration</a>.\n\nPrevious investigations have identified\na smaller central barred structure and four spiral arms.\n\nAstronomers still\nplace the Sun about a third of the way in from\nthe Milky Way's outer edge, in a minor arm called\nthe Orion Spur.\n\nTo locate the Sun and identify the Milky Way's newly mapped features,\njust place your cursor over the image.",
