  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere will the next Perseid meteor appear?  \n\nSky enthusiasts who trekked outside for the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/22jul_perseids2005.htm\">Perseid meteor shower</a> that peaked over the past few days \ntypically had this question on their mind.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astromeeting.de/atmospheric/050812perseids_ani.htm\">above movie</a>, where the time-line has been <a href=\"http://www.photomeeting.de/astromeeting/atmospheric/050812perseids_a_d.htm\">digitally altered</a>, captures part of that very mystery.  \n\nEight <a href=\"ap031116.html\">meteors</a> from the night of August 12 and\nthe morning of \nAugust 13 have been identified in the movie so far, seven of which are \n<a href=\"ap040820.html\">Perseids</a>.  \n\nCan you identify the non-Perseid meteor?  \n\nSince all <a href=\"http://www.amsmeteors.org/visual.html#Perseids\">Perseid meteors</a> appear to come from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellations\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Perseus.html\">Perseus</a>, the non-Perseid meteor is the one that streaks \nin a different direction.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\">Early reports</a> are that \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/meteors/gallery_12aug05.html\">this year's Perseids</a> were unfortunately a bit disappointing.  \n\nThe above digital mosaic was taken from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace\">Alsace</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html\">France</a>, with the photogenic \n<a href=\"ap050605.html\">band</a> of our \n<a href=\"http://cassfos02.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> far in the background.",
