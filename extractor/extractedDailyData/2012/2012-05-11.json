  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap120510.html\">The Super Moon wins</a>, by just a little, when\n<a href=\"ap080801.html\">its apparent size</a> is\ncompared to the Sun in this ingenious composite picture.\n\nTo make it, the Full Moon on May 6 was photographed\nwith the same camera and telescope used to image the Sun\n(with a dense solar filter!) on the following day.\n\nOf course, on May 6 the\n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.gr/\nAstro-Lunar-Scenes-Apo-Perigee-2010.htm\">Moon was at perigee</a>,\nthe closest point to Earth in its eliptical orbit,\nmaking it the largest Full Moon of 2012.\n\nTwo weeks later, on May 20, the\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041021.html\">Moon will be near\napogee</a>, the most distant point in its orbit, so by then it will\nbe nearly at its smallest apparent size.\n\nIt will also be a dark\n<a href=\"http://mplsstartribune.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/\nmoon-phases-for-kids1.jpg\">New Moon</a> on that date.\n\nAnd for some the New Moon will be surprisingly easy\nto compare to the Sun, because on\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2012.html\">May 20 the\nfirst solar eclipse</a> of 2012\nwill be visible from much of Asia, the Pacific, and North America.\n\nAlong a path 240 to 300 kilometers wide, the\n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">eclipse will\nbe annular</a>.\n\nNear apogee the smaller silhouetted Moon will fit just\n<a href=\"ap100122.html\">inside the bright solar disk</a>.",
