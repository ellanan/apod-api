  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap081211.html\">At the center of our Milky Way Galaxy</a>,\na mere 27,000 light-years away,\nlies a black hole with 4 million times the mass of the Sun.\n\nFondly known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced A-star),\nthe Milky Way's black hole is\n<a href=\"ap120702.html\">fortunately</a> mild-mannered compared\nto the central black holes in\n<a href=\"ap080110.html\">distant active galaxies</a>, much\nmore calmly consuming material around it.\n\nFrom time to time it does flare-up, though.\n\nAn outburst lasting several hours is captured in\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/\nnustar20121023.html\">this series of premier X-ray images</a>\nfrom the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/about-nustar\">Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array</a> (NuSTAR).\n\nLaunched last June 13, NuSTAR is the first to provide\n<a href=\"http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/for-astronomers\">focused views</a>\nof the area surrounding Sgr A* at X-ray energies higher than\nthose accessible to Chandra and XMM observatories.\n\nSpanning two days of NuSTAR observations,\nthe flare sequence is illustrated in the panels at the far right.\n\nX-rays are generated in material heated to over 100 million\ndegrees Celsius, accelerated to nearly the speed of light as it\nfalls into the Miky Way's central black hole.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/multimedia/\npia16213.html\">The main inset X-ray image</a>\nspans about 100 light-years.\n\nIn it, the bright white region represents the hottest material closest\nto the black hole, while the pinkish cloud likely belongs to a\nnearby <a href=\"ap060602.html\">supernova remnant</a>.",
