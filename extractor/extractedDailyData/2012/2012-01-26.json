  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA mere 12.5 million light-years from Earth, irregular\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110225.html\">dwarf galaxy NGC 4449</a>\nlies within the confines of\n<a href=\"http://maps.seds.org/Stars_en/Fig/canesvenatici.html\">Canes\nVenatici</a>, the constellation of the Hunting Dogs.\n\nAbout the size of our Milky Way's satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic\nCloud, NGC 4449 is undergoing an intense episode of star formation,\nevidenced by its wealth of young blue star clusters, pinkish star forming\nregions, and obscuring dust clouds in\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_ngc4449.html\">this\ndeep color portrait</a>.\n\nIt also holds the distinction of being the first\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2007/26/supplemental.html\">dwarf\ngalaxy</a> with\nan identified tidal star stream, faintly seen at the lower right.\n\nPlacing your cursor over the image reveals an inset of the\nstream resolved into red giant stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2154\">The star stream represents</a>\nthe remains of a still smaller\ninfalling satellite galaxy, disrupted by gravitational forces and\ndestined to merge with NGC 4449.\n\nWith relatively few stars, small galaxies\nare thought to possess extensive dark matter halos.\n\nBut since dark matter interacts gravitationally,\nthese observations offer a chance to examine\nthe significant\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\ndwarf_galaxy_dark_matter.html\">role of dark matter</a>\nin galactic merger events.\n\nThe interaction is likely responsible for NGC 4449's burst of star\nformation and offers a tantalizing insight into how even\nsmall galaxies are assembled over time.",
