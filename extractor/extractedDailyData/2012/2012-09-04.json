  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nShould you be worried about hurricanes? \n\nTo find out, it is useful to know where \n<a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqHED.html\">hurricanes</a> have gone in the past.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/idvsolutions/7840356344/\">above Earth map</a> \nshows the path of every <a href=\"ap040915.html\">hurricane</a> reported since 1851, \n\nAlthough striking, a growing incompleteness exists in the data the further one looks back in time.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGWtswLQp-A/UDPc4gW0AOI/AAAAAAAABYo/X61jhwPCR5s/s1600/LatLong_time_fun.jpg\">above map</a> graphically indicates that hurricanes -- sometimes called cyclones or typhoons depending on where they <a href=\"ap110827.html\">form</a> -- usually occur over water, which makes sense since evaporating warm water \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/hurricane-power.html\">gives them energy</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2012/08/24/look-at-this-every-recorded-hurricane-since-1851-on-one-map/\">map also shows</a> that hurricanes never cross -- or even occur very near -- the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator\">Earth's equator</a>, since the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect\">Coriolis effect</a> \ngoes to zero there, and hurricanes need the Coriolis force to circulate.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeY9tY9vKgs\">Coriolis force</a> also causes \n<a href=\"ap040406.html\">hurricane</a> paths to arc away from the equator.\n\nAlthough incompleteness fogs long term trends and the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Long-term_activity_trends\">prevalence of hurricanes</a> remains a topic of research, \nevidence is accumulating that hurricanes are, on the average, \n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4850542\">more common</a> \nand more powerful in the North Atlantic Ocean over the past 20 years.",
