  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid you see it? \n\nOne of the more common questions during a meteor shower occurs because the time it takes for a meteor to flash is typically less than the time it takes for a head to turn.\n\nPossibly, though, the glory of seeing \n<a href=\"ap070812.html\">bright meteors</a> shoot across and \n<a href=\"http://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-faq/\">knowing that</a> \nthey were once small pebbles on another world might make it all worthwhile, even if your \n<a href=\"http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lns72yE4mS1qhwmnpo1_500.jpg\">observing partner(s)</a> could not share in every particular experience.\n\nPeaking over the past few days, a dark moonless sky allowed the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrids\">Lyrids meteor shower</a> \nto exhibit as many as 30 visible meteors per hour from some locations.\n\nA <a href=\"ap090501.html\">bright Lyrid meteor</a> streaks above picturesque \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake\">Crater Lake</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\">Oregon</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>, in the \n<a href=\"http://portfolio.goldpaintphotography.com/p744063828/h1eb1b53#h1eb1b53\">above composite</a> of nine exposures taken last week.\n\nSnow covers the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Eq-xBvLqXs\">foreground</a>, \nwhile the majestic central band of our home galaxy arches well behind the serene lake.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide\">Other meteor showers</a> this year include the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseids</a> in mid-August and the Leonids in mid-November, both expected to also dodge the \n<a href=\"http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lns72yE4mS1qhwmnpo1_500.jpg\">glare</a> of a bright Moon in 2012.",
