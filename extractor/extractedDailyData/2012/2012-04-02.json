  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nVolcano Tungurahua sometimes erupts spectacularly. \n\n<a href=\"http://patricktaschler.com/portfolio/ecuador-tungurahua.html\">Pictured above</a>, \nmolten rock so hot it glows visibly pours down the sides of the 5,000-meter high \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungurahua\">Tungurahua</a>, while a cloud of \n<a href=\"http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/ash/\">dark ash</a> is seen being ejected toward the left.  \n\nWispy white clouds flow around the \n<a href=\"ap051002.html\">lava-lit peak</a>, while a star-lit sky shines in the distance.  \n\nThe above image was \n<a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/333708/327989/the-black-giant.html\">captured in 2006</a> as ash fell around the adventurous photographer.  \n\nLocated in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador\">Ecuador</a>, \n<a href=\"http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/Tungurahua\">Tungurahua</a> has become \nactive roughly every 90 years for the last 1,300 years.",
