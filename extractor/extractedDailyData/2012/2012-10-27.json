  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBeautiful <a href=\"ap060606.html\">emission nebula NGC 6164</a>\nwas created by a rare, hot, luminous\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html\">O-type</a>\nstar, some 40 times as massive as the Sun.\n\nSeen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere\n3 to 4 million years old.\n\nIn another three to four million years the massive star will end its\nlife in a <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nsupernovae.html\">supernova explosion</a>.\n\nSpanning around 4 light-years,\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/188\">the nebula itself</a>\nhas a bipolar symmetry.\n\nThat makes it similar in appearance to more familiar\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary\nnebulae</a> - the gaseous shrouds\n<a href=\"ap120831.html\">surrounding</a> dying sun-like stars.\n\nAlso like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have\nan extensive, <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?bibcode=1985PASP...97..780F&amp;\">faint halo</a>,\nrevealed in this deep telescopic image of the region.\n\nExpanding into the surrounding\n<a href=\"http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar\nmedium</a>,\nthe material in the\nhalo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star.\n\n<a href=\"http://dg-imaging.astrodon.com/gallery/\ndisplay.cfm?imgID=179\">The gorgeous skyscape</a>\nis a composite of narrow-band image data\nhighlighting the glowing gas, and broad-band data of the surrounding\nstarfield.\n\nNGC 6164 is 4,200 light-years away in the southern constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/nor/index.html\">of Norma</a>.",
