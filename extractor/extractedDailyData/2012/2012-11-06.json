  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is this moon shaped like a smooth egg?\n\nThe robotic Cassini spacecraft completed the first flyby ever of Saturn's small moon \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/methone/\">Methone</a> \nin May and discovered that the moon has no obvious craters.\n\nCraters, usually caused by impacts, have been seen on every \n<a href=\"ap070225.html\">moon</a>, \n<a href=\"ap100726.html\">asteroid, and comet nucleus</a> \never imaged in detail -- until now. \n\nEven the <a href=\"ap990711.html\">Earth</a> and \n<a href=\"ap041124.html\">Titan</a> have \n<a href=\"ap971110.html\">craters</a>.\n\nThe smoothness and egg-like shape of the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/05211206.html\">3-kilometer diameter moon</a> might be caused by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methone_%28moon%29\">Methone</a>'s \nsurface being able to shift -- \nsomething that might occur were the moon coated by a deep \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzyettXkIqY\">pile</a> of sub-visual \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile\">rubble</a>.\n\nIf so, the most similar objects in our Solar System would include Saturn's moons \n<a href=\"ap060222.html\">Telesto</a>, \n<a href=\"ap051123.html\">Pandora</a>, \n<a href=\"ap100217.html\">Calypso</a>, as well as asteroid \n<a href=\"ap070422.html\">Itokawa</a>, \nall of which show sections that are unusually smooth.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14633\">Methone</a> \nis not entirely featureless, though, as some surface sections \n<a href=\"ap120113.html\">appear darker</a> than others.\n\nAlthough flybys of Methone are \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/05211206.html\">difficult</a>, interest in the nature and \nhistory of this unusual moon is sure to continue.",
