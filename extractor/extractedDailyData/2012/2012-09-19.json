  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nNext stop: Ceres.\n\nLast week the robotic Dawn spacecraft ended its year-long mission to asteroid \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta\">Vesta</a>, becoming the first spacecraft ever to visit this far off world located between Mars and Jupiter, in the Solar System's \n<a href=\"http://www.solstation.com/stars/asteroid.htm\">main asteroid belt</a>.\n\nMany of the best images taken by Dawn at Vesta have been compiled into the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15678\">above encompassing view</a>.\n\nVesta shows evidence of being a leftover from the early years of our Solar System, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanet\">building block</a> for rocky planets like \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>.\n\nVesta's ancient surface shows heavy cratering and \n<a href=\"ap120514.html\">long troughs</a> likely created by huge impacts.\n\nThe minor planet's low gravity allows for \n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/103211579003359376826/posts\">surface</a> features like \n<a href=\"ap111128.html\">huge cliffs</a> and a large mountain that reaches twice the height of Earth's \n<a href=\"ap110417.html\">Mount Everest</a>, visible at the image bottom.\n\n<a href=\"ap110802.html\">Vesta</a>, however, spanning about 500 kilometers across, is only the <i>second</i> most massive object in the asteroid belt.\n\nAnd so, two weeks ago, <a href=\"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Dawn</a> fired its gentle \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sionrock.htm\">ion rockets</a> \nand has begun chasing the most massive: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29\">Ceres</a>.\n\nIf everything goes as planned, Dawn will reach Ceres in \n<a href=\"http://images.gizmag.com/hero/mycopter.jpg\">2015</a>.\n\nCeres looks \n<a href=\"ap070622.html\">quite different</a> to the distant telescope -- \nbut what will Dawn find?",
