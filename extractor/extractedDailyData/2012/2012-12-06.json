  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGlobular star cluster 47 Tucanae is a jewel of the southern sky.\n\nAlso <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n0104.html\">known\nas NGC 104</a>, it roams\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/milkyway/\ncomponents.html\">the halo</a> of our Milky Way Galaxy\nalong with around 200 other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nGlobular_cluster\">globular star clusters</a>.\n\nThe second brightest globular cluster (after\n<a href=\"ap100331.html\">Omega Centauri</a>)\nas seen from planet Earth, it lies about 13,000 light-years away and\ncan be spotted naked-eye near the\n<a href=\"ap100903.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> (SMC)\nin the constellation of\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/tuc/\">the Toucan</a>.\n\nOf course, the SMC is some 210,000 light-years\ndistant, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way and not physically close\nto 47 Tuc.\n\nStars on the outskirts of the SMC are seen at the upper left of\n<a href=\"http://www.astroeder.com/47tuc_eder_en.html\">this\nbroad southern skyscape</a>.\n\nToward the lower right with about the same\n<a href=\"ap080801.html\">apparent</a> diameter as a Full\nMoon, dense cluster 47 Tuc is made up of several million\n<a href=\"ap080906.html\">stars</a> in a\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/ask/a11508.html\">volume</a>\nonly about 120 light-years across.\n\nAway from the bright cluster core,\nthe <a href=\"ap081218.html\">red giants</a>\nof 47 Tuc are easy to pick out as yellowish tinted stars.\n\nGlobular cluster 47 Tuc is also home to exotic\n<a href=\"ap050721.html\">x-ray binary</a> star systems.",
