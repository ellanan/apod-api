  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap100625.html\">Part of a dark expanse</a> that splits\nthe crowded plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the Aquila Rift arcs\nthrough the northern hemisphere's summer skies\nnear bright star Altair and the <a href=\"ap090912.html\">Summer Triangle</a>.\n\nIn silhouette against the Milky Way's faint\n<a href=\"ap090613.html\">starlight</a>,\nits dusty molecular clouds likely contain raw material\nto form hundreds of thousands of stars and\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2842\">astronomers eagerly search</a>\nthe clouds for telltale signs of star birth.\n\n<a href=\"http://skycenter.arizona.edu/gallery/nebulae/LDN673\">This\ntelescopic close-up</a> looks toward the region at a\nfragmented Aquila dark cloud complex identified as LDN 673,\nstretching across a field of view slightly wider than the full moon.\n\nIn the scene,\nvisible indications of\n<a href=\"ap110905.html\">energetic outflows</a> associated\n<a href=\"ap111027.html\">with young stars</a>\ninclude the small red tinted nebulosity RNO 109 at top\nleft and Herbig-Haro object\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo9935a/\">HH32</a>\nabove and right of center.\n\nThe dark clouds\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_%28constellation%29\">in\nAquila</a> are estimated to be some 600 light-years away.  \n\nAt that distance, this field of view spans about 7 light-years.",
