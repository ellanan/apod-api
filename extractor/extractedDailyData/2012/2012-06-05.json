  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday Venus moves in front of the Sun.\n\nOne way to \n<a href=\"http://venustransit.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">follow this rare event</a> \nis to actively reload the above live image of the Sun during the \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/transit12.html\">right time interval</a> \nand look for an unusual circular dark dot.\n\nThe smaller sprawling dark areas are \n<a href=\"ap031027.html\">sunspots</a>.\n\nThe circular dot is the planet \n<a href=\"ap080226.html\">Venus</a>.\n\nThe dark dot will only appear during a few very specific hours, \nfrom about 22:10 on 2012 June 5 through 4:50 2012 June 6, \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/universal-time\">Universal</a> \n<a href=\"http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl\">Time</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/Some-Details-About-Transits-of-Venus.html\">transit is</a> the rarest type of solar eclipse known -- \nmuch more rare than an eclipse of the Sun by \n<a href=\"ap120528.html\">the Moon</a> or even by the \n<a href=\"ap061114.html\">planet Mercury</a>.\n\nIn fact, the next transit of Venus across the Sun will be in 2117.\n\nAnyone with a \n<a href=\"http://www.transitofvenus.org/june2012/eye-safety/281-six-ways-to-see-the-transit-of-venus\">clear view</a> of the Sun can go outside and \n<a href=\"http://images.dailydawdle.com/cat-peeking.jpg\">carefully view</a> \nthe transit for themselves by projecting sunlight through a \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/how.html#CARD\">hole in a card</a> \nonto a wall.\n\nBecause this \n<a href=\"ap120603.html\">Venus transit</a> is so unusual and \nvisible from so much of the Earth, it is expected to be one of the \nmore photographed celestial events in history.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_HMIIC.jpg\">above live image</a> on the Sun is being taken by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory\">Solar \nDynamics Observatory</a> and can be updated about every 15 minutes.\n<i> Editor's note: </i> Since the transit has ended, the live image was replaced by one taken just before Venus crossed out of Sun.",
