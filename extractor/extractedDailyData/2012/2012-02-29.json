  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nVenus and Jupiter will appear unusually close in the sky over the next month.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/pictorial-guide-to-venus-jupiter-conjunction-in-february-march-2012\">planetary conjunction</a> will be easily visible to the unaided eye because Venus will appear brighter than any background star, and Jupiter will be nearly as bright.\n\nTo see the \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/best-venusjupiter-conjunction-in-years-mid-march-2012\">near-alignment</a>, simply look to the west after sunset.\n\nAt their closest, on March 15, the \n<a href=\"ap120223.html\">two planets</a> will appear only about three degrees apart.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Venus_Jupiter_Mercury_conjunction\">The planets</a> will not be significantly closer in space - Venus will just be passing nearly in front of Jupiter as seen from the Earth.\n\nIn the above image composite taken late last week from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia\">Catalonia</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, \na bright crescent moon appears to the right of Venus, \nwhile Jupiter appears near the top of the image. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8br4JiFEik\">distant \nsun-illuminated spheres</a> were photographed behind a sculpture depicting the legendary battle between a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon\">warrior and a dragon</a>. \n\nA <a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=27475\">gallery of conjunction images</a> is visible on the \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=120229\">Asterisk</a> -- \nAPOD's discussion board.  \n\nPlease feel free to contribute.\n\nThe next \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">Jupiter-Venus conjunction</a> will occur in May 2013.",
