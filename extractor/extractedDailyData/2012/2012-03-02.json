  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFive hand drawn sketches of Jupiter were used to create this\nbeautifully detailed flat map of the ruling gas giant's\n<a href=\"ap030906.html\">turbulent cloud tops</a>.\n\nMade with colored pencils at the eyepiece of a 16 inch diameter\ntelescope, the original drawings are about 5 inches (12.5 cm) in\ndiameter.\n\nThe drawn\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1872AReg...10..169G\">planisphere\nmap</a> dimensions are 16x8 inches (40x20 cm).\n\nObserving on different dates in November and December of 2011,\nastronomical artist Fred Burgeot has relied\n<a href=\"http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter\">on\nJupiter's</a> rotation to\ncover the planet's complete circumference.\n\nDigital animator Pascal Chauvet has also translated Burgeot's drawings\ninto an <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/35740232\">intriguing video (vimeo)</a>,\nsynthesizing a telescopic view of the rotating planet\nwith a tilt and phase appropriate for the observing dates.\n\nThe video includes the <a href=\"ap091023.html\">Galilean moons</a>\nmoving along their orbits,\nbeginning with Ganymede and Io casting shadows as they\nglide in front of Jupiter, followed\nby Europa and Callisto passing behind the planet's banded disk.",
