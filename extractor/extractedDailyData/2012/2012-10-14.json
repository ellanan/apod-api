  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat did the first galaxies look like?\n\nTo help answer this question, the Hubble Space Telescope has just finished taking the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/\">eXtreme Deep Field</a> (XDF), the deepest image of the universe ever taken in \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/visible.html\">visible light</a>.  \n\nPictured above, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Extreme_Deep_Field\">XDF</a> shows a sampling of some of the \n<a href=\"ap040217.html\">oldest galaxies</a> ever seen, \ngalaxies that formed just after the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Sci...300.1904M\">dark ages</a>, 13 billion years ago, when the universe was \nonly a few percent of its present age.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/\">ACS</a> camera and the infrared channel \nof the <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3\">WFPC3</a> camera took \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odprMkzOst8\">the image</a>. \n\nCombining efforts spread over 10 years, the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/xdf.html\">XDF</a> is more sensitive, in some colors, \nthan the original <a href=\"ap020901.html\">Hubble Deep Field</a> (HDF), the \n<a href=\"ap040929.html\">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> (HUDF) completed in 2004, and the \n<a href=\"ap091209.html\">HUDF Infrared</a> completed in 2009.\n\nAstronomers the world over will likely study the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/image/a/\">XDF</a> for years to come to\nbetter understand how stars and galaxies formed in the early universe.",
