  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow massive can a normal star be?  \n\nEstimates made from distance, brightness and standard \n\n<a href=\"http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys230/lectures/star_age/star_age.html\">solar models</a> had given one star in the \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a> Pismis 24 \nover 200 times the mass of our Sun, nearly making it the record holder.  \n\nThis star is the brightest object located just above the gas front in the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0619.html\">above image</a>.  \n\nClose inspection of images taken with the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nhowever, have shown that Pismis 24-1 derives its \nbrilliant luminosity \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0619b.html\">not from a single star</a> but from \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...660.1480M\">three at least</a>.  \n\nComponent stars would still remain near 100 solar masses, \nmaking them among the more \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_massive_stars\">massive stars</a> currently on record.  \n\nToward the bottom of the image, stars are still forming in the associated \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebula</a> \n<a href=\"ap081009.html\">NGC 6357</a>.\n\nAppearing perhaps like a <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Catedral_Metropolitana_de_Sao_Paulo_1_Brasil-edit-01.jpg\">Gothic cathedral</a>, energetic stars near the center\nappear to be breaking out and illuminating a \n<a href=\"ap060507.html\">spectacular cocoon</a>.",
