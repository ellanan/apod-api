  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBlown by the wind from a massive star, this interstellar\napparition has a surprisingly\n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/bubbles/\nbubbles.html\">familiar shape</a>.\n\nCataloged as NGC 7635, it is also known simply\nas <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1998/31/index.html\">The\nBubble Nebula</a>.\n\nAlthough it looks delicate, the 10 light-year diameter\nbubble offers evidence of\n<a href=\"ap080117.html\">violent processes</a> at work.\n\nAbove and right of the Bubble's center is a hot,\n<a href=\"ap070726.html\">O star</a>, several hundred thousand\ntimes more luminous and around 45 times more massive\nthan the Sun.\n\nA fierce stellar wind and intense radiation from that\nstar has blasted out the\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?\nbibcode=1995A%26A...295..509C\">structure of glowing gas</a>\nagainst denser material\n<a href=\"ap060428.html\">in a surrounding</a>\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/GMC.html\">molecular\ncloud</a>.\n\nThe intriguing Bubble Nebula lies a mere\n11,000 light-years away toward the boastful constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/\nindex.html\">Cassiopeia</a>.\n\nThis view of the cosmic bubble is composed of narrowband and broadband\nimage data, capturing details in the emission region while\nrecording a natural looking field of stars.",
