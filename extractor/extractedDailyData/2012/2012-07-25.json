  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is this aurora strikingly pink? \n\nWhen photographing picturesque \n<a href=\"ap120425.html\">Crater Lake</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\">Oregon</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a> last month, the background sky lit up with \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/06/18/aurora-in-the-pink/\">auroras of unusual colors</a>.\n\nAlthough much is known about the \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/auror3.htm\">physical mechanisms</a> \nthat create auroras, accurately predicting the occurrence and colors of auroras remains a topic of investigation.\n\nTypically, it is known, the lowest \n<a href=\" ap110517.html\">auroras appear green</a>.  \n\nThese \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/06/18/aurora-in-the-pink/\">occur</a> at about 100 kilometers high and involve atmospheric \noxygen atoms excited by \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mz2laHjVoQ\">fast moving plasma</a> from space. \n\nThe next highest auroras -- at about 200 kilometers up -- \n<a href=\"ap980901.html\">appear red</a>, and are also emitted by resettling atmospheric oxygen. \n\nSome of the highest auroras visible -- as high as 500 kilometers up -- \n<a href=\"ap081119.html\">appear blue</a>, and are \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/akso/nature/science/ak_park_science/PDF/2009Vol8-1/The-Colors-of-the-Aurora.pdf\">caused by</a> sunlight-scattering nitrogen ions.\n\nWhen <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45858333\">looking from the ground</a> \nthrough different layers of distant auroras, \ntheir colors can combine to produce unique and spectacular hues, \nin this case rare pink hues <a href=\"http://portfolio.goldpaintphotography.com/oregon/h396540d#h396540d\">seen above</a>.\n\nAs <a href=\"ap071203.html\">Solar Maximum</a> nears over the next two years, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare\">particle explosions</a> \nfrom the Sun are sure to continue and likely to create even more \n<a href=\"ap110328.html\">memorable nighttime displays</a>.",
