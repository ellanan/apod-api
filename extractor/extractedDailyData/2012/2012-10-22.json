  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWas that the space shuttle that just went by?\n\nGarnering attention that could make even a movie star blush, thousands of people watched in awe as a quintessential icon of the space age was towed through the streets of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles\">Los Angeles</a>.\n\nAfter <a href=\"ap120926.html\">landing</a> at\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAX\">LAX airport</a> late last month, the\n<a href=\"ap100907.html\">shuttle Endeavour</a> was carefully loaded onto rolling trailers and maneuvered down roads and across bridges to the\n<a href=\"http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/MainPage.php\">California Science Center</a>, 20 kilometers away.\n\nTo many, there was a majesty to the voyage that was beyond description, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/status_reports/Endeavour_status_10_12_12_prt.htm\">inspiring people</a> to line the LA streets and wait at windows and balconies to\n<a href=\"http://framework.latimes.com/2012/10/18/behind-the-lens-shooting-the-endeavour-time-lapse-video/\">witness and photograph</a> this once-in-a-lifetime event. \n\nNarrowly avoiding some buildings and trees, the retired shuttle <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/space-shuttle-endeavour-mission-accomplished.html\">made it safely</a> to its new home and will\n<a href=\"http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/Exhibits/AirAndSpace/endeavour/endeavour.php\">soon be ready</a> for permanent display.\n\nAlthough the journey took place over <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/shuttle-endeavour.html\">three days</a>, it has been shortened in the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/videogallery/72904629/News/Time-lapse-video-Space-shuttle-Endeavour-s-crosstown-journey-through-L-A\">above artistic time-lapse video</a> to about three minutes.",
