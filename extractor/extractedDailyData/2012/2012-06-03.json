  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe rare\n<a href=\"ap040608.html\">transit of Venus</a> across the face of the Sun in 2004 was one of the better-photographed events in sky history.  \n\nBoth scientific and artistic <a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/venustransit/gallery_08jun04.htm\">images flooded in</a> from the areas that could see\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_fd8O1sk3I\">the transit</a>: Europe and much of Asia, Africa, and North America.  \n\nScientifically, solar photographers confirmed that the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drop_effect\">black\ndrop effect</a> is really better <a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1277_1.asp\">related</a> to the viewing clarity of the camera or telescope than the atmosphere of <a href=\"ap040610.html\">Venus</a>.\n\nArtistically, images might be divided into several categories.  \n\nOne type captures the\n<a href=\"ap040611.html\">transit in front of a highly detailed Sun</a>.  \n\nAnother category captures a <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_e2ljdIfxnyM/RoCszR3pPsI/AAAAAAAADAE/laMq-dPOXOc/s1600/double+twins.jpg\">double coincidence</a> such as both <a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/venustransit/gallery_08jun04_page11.htm\">Venus and an airplane</a> simultaneously silhouetted, or\n<a href=\"ap040720.html\">Venus and the\nInternational Space Station</a> in low Earth orbit.\n\nA third image type involves a fortuitous arrangement of interesting looking clouds, as shown by example in the\n<a href=\"http://www.davidcortner.com/astro/vtransit/\">above image</a>\ntaken from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina\">North Carolina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.\n\nSky enthusiasts worldwide are abuzz about the coming transit of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/venus-transit/\">Venus on Tuesday</a>.\n\nIt is perhaps \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=120603\">interesting to wonder</a> whether any person will live to see -- and remember seeing -- both Tuesday's Venus transit and the next one in 2117.",
