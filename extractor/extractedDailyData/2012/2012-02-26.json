  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's causing those odd rings in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">supernova</a> 1987A?  \n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/02/23/happy-25th-annniversary-supernova-1987a/\">Twenty five years ago</a>, in 1987, the brightest <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a>\nin recent history was seen in the\n<a href=\"ap060510.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.\n\nAt the center of the\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1142a/\">above picture</a> is an object central to the\nremains of the violent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTTGVzqbypI\">stellar explosion</a>.\n\nSurrounding the center are\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/sn1987anino.html\">curious outer rings</a> appearing as a flattened figure 8.  \n\nAlthough large telescopes including the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--X9zfgZtS0\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> monitor the curious rings every few years, their origin remains a mystery.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1142a/\">Pictured above</a> is a Hubble image of the SN1987A remnant taken last year.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3387\">Speculation</a> into the cause of the rings includes beamed\njets emanating from an otherwise hidden\n<a href=\"ap110305.html\">neutron star</a> left over from the supernova, and the interaction of the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEBLt6Kd9EY\">wind</a> from the progenitor star with gas released before the explosion.",
