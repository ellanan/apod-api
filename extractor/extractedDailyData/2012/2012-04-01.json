  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe Omicron Cetians have been silenced. \n\nAfter alien-like \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters\">monsters</a> were reported to disturb his daughter's sleep for four nights in a row, this father took action.  \n\nWhen last questioned, the daughter seemed to indicate that the \n<a href=\"http://www.seeingwithsound.com/javoice.htm\">hullabaloo</a> might have come from a planetary system possibly sounding like \"Omicron Ceti\".  \n\nGetting to the root of the problem, the dad then took his daughter outside and used a powerful \n<a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/are-laser-pointers-dangerous.htm\">laser</a> to \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66aVXk5jSn8\">blast</a> the alien's home world. \n\nHumorously, the parent star \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira\">Omicron Ceti</a> \nnow shows itself to be unstable and is dramatically increasing its brightness. \n\nHappy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fool%27s_Day\">April Fool's Day</a> from the folks at \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a>. \n\nIn actuality, the star being pointed out is \n<a href=\"ap060722.html\">Mira</a>, a famous variable star expected to reach its maximum brightness again in late August.  \n\nThe father in question was actually pointing out, to his daughter, \n<a href=\"ap070221.html\">the star</a> that shares her name.",
