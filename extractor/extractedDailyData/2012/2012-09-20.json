  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap101231.html\">An analemma</a> is that figure-8 curve that\nyou get when you\n<a href=\"http://www.twigsdigs.com/sundials/office/\">mark the position\nof the Sun</a> at the same time each day\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mfm3yQW16g\">throughout\nplanet Earth's year</a>.\n\nIn this case, a composite of 17 individual images taken at 0231 UT\non dates between April 2 and September 16 follows half the analemma curve.\n\nThe scene looks east\ntoward the rising sun and the Caspian sea from the boardwalk in the port\ncity of Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nWith the sun nearest the horizon, those dates almost span the period\nbetween the 2012 <a href=\"ap100923.html\">equinoxes</a> on\nMarch 20 and September 22.\n\nThe northern summer <a href=\"ap120626.html\">Solstice</a>\non June 20  corresponds to the top of the\nfigure 8 at the left, when the Sun stood at its northernmost\ndeclination.\n\n<a href=\"ap061230.html\">Of course</a>,\nthis year the exposure made on June 6 contained a little\nsomething extra.\n \nSlightly enhanced, the little black spot on the bright solar disk near\nthe top of the frame is planet Venus, caught in\n<a href=\"ap120620.html\">a rare transit</a> during\nthis well-planned sunrise analemma project.",
