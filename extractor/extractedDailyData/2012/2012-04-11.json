  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy don't those stars move?\n\nStars in the sky will typically appear to rise and \n<a href=\"ap110504.html\">set</a> as the Earth turns.\n\nThose far to the north or south will appear to \n<a href=\"ap100711.html\">circle</a> the pole.\n\nIf you look closely at the \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/39536582\">above time-lapse movie</a>, \nhowever, there are points of light that appear \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eolbg4PAUVY\">stationary</a>.\n\nThese objects are not stars but \nhuman-launched robotic spacecraft that remain fixed high above the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator\">Earth's equator</a>.\n\nCalled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit\">geostationary satellites</a>, they don't fall down because they do orbit the Earth -- they just orbit at exactly the same speed that the \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">Earth rotates</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/EveningStar/Unit4/unit4_sub3.htm\">orbital</a> distance where this is possible is much farther than the \n<a href=\"ap110309.html\">International Space Station</a> but much closer than the Moon.\n\nThe video was taken from one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHnN8YnnCSw\">highest</a> \nrevolving restaurants in the world located on the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelallalin\">Mittelallalin</a> \nin the Swiss \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a>.\n\nIn the foreground is a mountain known as the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allalinhorn\">Allalinhorn</a>. \n\nAn even closer inspection will show that the \n<a href=\"http://www.goes.noaa.gov/\">geostationary satellites</a> flash with \n<a href=\"ap060819.html\">glint</a>s of reflected sunlight.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satellites_in_geosynchronous_orbit\">The satellites</a> also all appear on a single line -- \nactually the projection of the Earth's equator onto the sky.",
