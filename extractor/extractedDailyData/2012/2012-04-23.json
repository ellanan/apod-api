  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nNo, they are not alive -- but they are dying.\n\nThe unusual blobs found in the\n<a href=\"ap090524.html\">Carina nebula</a>, some of which are seen floating on the upper right, might best be described as\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGjwe-BCfms\">evaporating</a>.\n\nEnergetic light and winds from nearby stars are breaking apart the dark\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ARA%26A..41..241D\">dust grains</a> that make the iconic forms opaque.\n\nIronically the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/131/5/2580/fulltext/205118.text.html\">blobs</a>, otherwise known as dark\n<a href=\"ap120129.html\">molecular clouds</a>,\nfrequently create in their midst the very stars that later\n<a href=\"ap100426.html\">destroy them</a>.  \n\nThe floating space mountains\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1127a/\">pictured above</a> by the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> span a few light months.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula\">Great Nebula in Carina</a> itself spans about 30 light years, lies about 7,500 light years\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLXeFwddt00\">away</a>, and can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of Keel\n(<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/carina.html\">Carina</a>).",
