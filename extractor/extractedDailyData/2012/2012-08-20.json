  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs that a cloud hovering over the Sun?\n\nYes, but it is quite different than a cloud hovering over the Earth.\n\nThe long light feature on the left of the \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bads_photos/7719395116/\">above color-inverted image</a> \nis actually a solar filament and is composed of mostly charged \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> gas held aloft by the Sun's \n<a href=\"http://solar-center.stanford.edu/magnetism/magneticfields.html\">looping magnetic field</a>.\n\nBy contrast, clouds over the Earth are usually much \n<a href=\"http://patriciahansen55.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CoolCats-lg.jpg\">cooler</a>, \ncomposed mostly of tiny water droplets, and are \n<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-clouds-float-when\">held aloft</a> \nby upward air motions because they are weigh so little.  \n\nThe above filament was captured on the Sun about two weeks ago near the \n<a href=\"ap120714.html\">active solar</a> region  \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wp135SCCqo\">AR 1535</a> visible on the \n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/103211579003359376826/posts\">ri</a>ght with dark sunspots.\n\n<a href=\"ap101215.html\">Filament</a>s typically last for a few days to a week, but a long \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence\">filament</a> \nlike this might hover over the Sun's surface for a month or more.\n\nSome filaments trigger large \n<a href=\"http://www.ips.gov.au/Educational/2/4/1\">Hyder flares</a> \nif they suddenly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67RHwXBAXps\">collapse back</a> \nonto the Sun.",
