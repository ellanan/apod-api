  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe first identified  compact galaxy group,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9802328\">Stephan's Quintet</a>\nis featured in\nthis eye-catching image constructed with data drawn from\nthe extensive <a href=\"http://hla.stsci.edu/\">Hubble Legacy Archive</a>.\n\nAbout 300 million light-years away, only four of these five galaxies\nare actually\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2001/22/\">locked\nin a cosmic dance</a>\nof repeated close encounters.\n\nThe odd man out is easy to spot, though.\n\nThe interacting galaxies,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2001/22/\nimage/h/format/large_web/\">NGC 7319, 7318A, 7318B, and 7317</a>\nhave an overall yellowish cast.\n\nThey also tend to have distorted\n<a href=\"ap090426.html\">loops and tails</a>, grown under the\ninfluence of disruptive <a href=\"ap081115.html\">gravitational tides</a>.\n\nBut the predominantly bluish galaxy, NGC 7320,\nis closer, just 40 million light-years distant,\nand isn't part of the interacting group.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/25/\nimage/x/\">Stephan's Quintet</a>\nlies within the boundaries of the high flying\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/peg/index.html\">constellation\nPegasus</a>.\n\nAt the estimated distance of the quartet of interacting galaxies,\nthis field of view spans about 500,000 light-years.\n\nHowever, moving just beyond this field, above and to the left,\nastronomers can identify another galaxy,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2001/22/\nimage/h/format/large_web/\">NGC 7320C</a>, that is also 300 million\nlight-years distant.\n\nOf course, including it would bring the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/stephan/\nindex.html\">interacting quartet back up to quintet status</a>.",
