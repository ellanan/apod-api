  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis moon is shining by the light of its planet.\n\nSpecifically, a large portion of Enceladus \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00003360/\">pictured above</a> \nis illuminated primarily by sunlight first reflected from the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/index.cfm?SciencePageID=51\">planet Saturn</a>.\n\nThe result is that the normally \n<a href=\"ap050317.html\">snow-white</a> moon appears in the gold color of \n<a href=\"ap060503.html\">Saturn's cloud tops</a>.  \n\nAs most of the illumination comes from the image left, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth\">labyrinth</a> of ridges throws notable shadows just to the right of the image center, while the kilometer-deep canyon \n<a href=\"ap081222.html\">Labtayt Sulci</a> is visible just below.\n\nThe bright thin crescent on the far right is the only part of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fpErxgWzQ\">Enceladus</a> \ndirectly lit by the Sun.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ugordan/6823818755/\">above image</a> \nwas taken last year by the robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens\">Cassini spacecraft</a> during a close pass by by the enigmatic moon.  \n\nInspection of the lower part of this digitally sharpened image reveals \n<a href=\"ap091124.html\">plumes of ice</a> \ncrystals thought to originate in a \n<a href=\"http://astrobio.net/pressrelease/3756/a-fizzy-ocean-on-enceladus\">below-surface sea</a>.",
