  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere's the other star?\n\nAt the center of this supernova remnant should be the companion star to the star that blew up.  \n\nIdentifying this star is important for understanding just how\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia supernova</a> detonate, which in turn could lead to a better understanding of why the brightness of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BPxc5-9M-4\">such explosions</a> are so predictable, which in turn is key to calibrating the entire\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">nature of our universe</a>.\n\nThe trouble is that even a careful inspection of the center of\n<a href=\"ap110125.html\">SNR 0509-67.5</a> has not found any star at all.\n\nThis indicates that the companion is intrinsically very faint -- much more faint that many types of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZkAoR3WLE\">bright giant stars</a> that had been previous candidates.\n\nIn fact, the implication is that the\n<a href=\"ap060722.html\">companion star</a> might have to be a faint\n<a href=\"ap100221.html\">white dwarf</a>,\nsimilar to -- but less massive than -- the star that detonated.  \n\nSNR 0509-67.5 is <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2010/snr0509/\">shown above</a> in both visible light,\nshining in red as imaged by the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/the_story.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays.html\">X-ray light</a>, shown in false-color green as imaged by the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>.\n\nPutting your cursor over the picture will highlight the central required\nlocation for the missing companion star.",
