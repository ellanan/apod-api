  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis galaxy is having a bad millennium. \n\nIn fact, the past 100 million years haven't been so good, \nand probably the next billion or so will be quite tumultuous. \n\nVisible on the upper left, NGC 4038 used to be a normal spiral galaxy, minding its own business, until NGC 4039, toward its right, \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=28941\">crashed into it</a>. \n\nThe evolving wreckage, known famously as \n<a href=\"ap110429.html\">the Antennae</a>, is pictured above. \n\nAs gravity \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/wp/asow/2012/06/24/galaxies-in-collision/\">restructures each galaxy,</a> clouds of gas slam into each other, \nbright blue knots of stars form, massive stars form and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8srN24pSQ\">explode</a>, \nand brown filaments of dust are strewn about. \n\nEventually the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antennae_Galaxies\">two galaxies</a> \nwill converge into one larger spiral galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"ap120717.html\">Such collisions</a> are not unusual, and even our own \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nhas undergone several in the past and is \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqjSgZdo5XE\">predicted to collide</a> \nwith our neighboring \n<a href=\"ap090510.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a> in a few billion years.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/46/original.html\">frames that\ncompose this image</a> \nwere taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope by professional astronomers to \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AJ....109..960W\">better understand galaxy collisions</a>.\n\nThese frames -- and many other deep space images from \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble</a> -- have since been \n<a href=\"http://hla.stsci.edu/hla_help.html\">made public</a>, \nallowing an interested amateur to download and \n<a href=\"http://www.telovation.com/photos/old-computers-3.jpg\">process</a> \nthem into this visually stunning composite.",
