  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat did you do over your winter vacation?\n\nIf you were the Opportunity rover on Mars, you spent four months of it \nstationary and perched on the northern slope of \n<a href=\"ap120125.html\">Greeley Haven</a> -- and \ntilted so that your solar panels could absorb as much sunlight as possible. \n\nDuring its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fY1F3Gpoa4\">winter stopover</a>, \nthe usually <a href=\"ap110508.html\">rolling robot</a> \nundertook several science activities including snapping over 800 images of its \nsurroundings, many of which have been combined into \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15689\">this 360-degree digitally-compressed panorama</a> \nand shown in exaggerated colors to highlight different surface features.  \n\nPast tracks of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover\">Opportunity</a> \ncan be seen toward the left, while Opportunity's dust covered solar panels cross the image bottom.\n\nJust below the horizon and right of center, an interior wall of 20-kilometer \n<a href=\"ap110815.html\">Endeavour Crater</a> can be seen.\n\nNow that the northern Martian winter is over, Opportunity is rolling again, this time straight ahead (north).\n\nThe rover is \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20120509a.html\">set to investigate</a> \nunusual light-colored soil patches as it begins again to further \n<a href=\"http://www.gapphotos.com/images/WebPreview/0100/0100358.jpg\">explore</a> the inside of Endeavour, \na crater that may hold some of the oldest features yet visited.",
