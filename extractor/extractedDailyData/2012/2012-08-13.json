  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it be like to fly through the universe?\n\nPossibly the best simulated video of this yet has been composed from \n<a href=\"http://www.sdss3.org/dr9/\">recently-released galaxy data</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey\">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>.\n\nEvery spot in the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LBltePDZw&amp;\">above video</a> is a galaxy containing billions of stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/includes/sideimages/sdss_pie2.html\">Many galaxies</a> are part of \n<a href=\"ap100502.html\">huge clusters</a>, \nlong <a href=\"ap090609.html\">filaments</a>, or \n<a href=\"ap120225.html\">small groups</a>, while \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/G/Galactic+Voids\">expansive voids</a> \nnearly absent of galaxies also exist.\n\nThe movie starts by flying right through a large nearby cluster of galaxies \nand later circles the SDSS-captured universe at about 2 billion light years \n(a <a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/cosmological+redshift\">redshift</a> of about 0.15) from Earth.\n\nAnalyses of \n<a href=\"ap031028.html\">galaxy positions</a> and movements continues to bolster the case that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N\">our universe</a> contains not only the bright matter seen, like galaxies, but also a significant amount of unseen \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter/\">dark matter</a> and \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/10/04/dark-energy-faq/\">dark energy</a>.",
