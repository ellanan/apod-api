  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over the south pole of Titan?\n\nA vortex of \n<a href=\"ap040810.html\">haze</a> \nappears to be forming, although no one is sure why.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14919\">above natural-color image</a> \nshows the light-colored feature.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-200\">vortex</a> was found on images taken last month when the robotic \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> \nflew by the unusual atmosphere-shrouded moon of Saturn.\n\nCassini was only able to see the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14920\">southern vortex</a> because its orbit \n<a href=\"ap061113.html\">around Saturn</a> was recently boosted out of the plane where the rings and moons move. \n\nClues as to what created the enigmatic feature are accumulating, including that \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BT2LafUIA\">Titan</a>'s air appears to be sinking in the center and rising around the edges.\n\nWinter, however, is slowly descending on the south of Titan, so that \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh5lBr08WJw\">the vortex</a>, if it survives, \nwill be plunged into darkness over the next few years.",
