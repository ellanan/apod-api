  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere's the full Moon?\n\nSomewhere in this image, the Earth's Moon is hiding.  \n\nThe entire Moon is visible, in its completely full phase, in plain sight.\n\nEven the photographer's keen eye couldn't find it even though he knew exactly where to look -- only the\n<a href=\"ap110717.html\">long exposure</a> of his camera picked it up -- barely.  \n\nAlthough by now you might be <a href=\"http://cdn.randomfunnypicture.com/pictures/1107_16_344_2007.jpg\">congratulating yourself</a> on finding it, why was it so difficult to see?\n\nFor one reason, this photograph was taken during the\n<a href=\"ap111214.html\">total lunar eclipse</a> last month, when the Earth's <a href=\"ap111215.html\">shadow</a> made the Moon much dimmer than a normal full Moon.\n\nFor another, the image, taken in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado\">Colorado</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state\">USA</a>,\nwas captured just 12 minutes before sunrise.\n\nWith the Moon on the exact opposite side of the sky from the Sun, this meant that the Sun was just below the horizon, but still\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight\">slightly illuminating</a>\nthe sky.\n\nLast, as the\n<a href=\"ap111127.html\">Moon</a> was only about two degrees above the horizon, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy)\">large volume of air</a> between the camera and the horizon scattered a lot of light away from the\n<a href=\"ap060911.html\">background Moon</a>.\n\nTwelve minutes after this image was acquired the Sun peeked over the horizon and the Moon set.",
