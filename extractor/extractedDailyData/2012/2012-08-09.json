  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis composite of images spaced some 5 to 7 days apart\nfrom late October 2011 (top right) through early July 2012\n(bottom left), traces the\n<a href=\"http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/\nretrograd.html\">retrograde motion</a> of ruddy-colored Mars through\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/Mars\">planet Earth's night sky</a>.\n\nTo connect the dots in Mars' retrograde loop,\njust slide your cursor over the picture\n(and check out\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3003742\">this\nanimation</a>).\n\nBut Mars didn't actually reverse the direction of its orbit.\n\nInstead, the apparent backwards motion with\nrespect to the background stars is a\nreflection of the motion of the Earth itself.\n\nRetrograde motion\n<a href=\"http://projects.astro.illinois.edu/data/Retrograde/\">can be\nseen</a> each time Earth overtakes\nand laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the\nEarth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit. \n\nOn March 4th, <a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/spider/Mars/\nmars2012.html\">2012 Mars was opposite</a> the Sun in\nEarth's sky, near its closest and brightest at the center of this picture.\n\nJust arrived\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\">on the\nsurface of the Red Planet</a>, the\nCuriosity rover was launched on November 26, when Mars was\nnear the crossover point of its retrograde loop.\n\nOf course, Mars can now be spotted\nclose to Saturn and bright star Spica, near\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance\">the western\nhorizon after sunset</a>.",
