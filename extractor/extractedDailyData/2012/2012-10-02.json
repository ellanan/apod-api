  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nFresh evidence of an ancient stream has been found on Mars.\n\nThe robotic rover \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_rover\">Curiosity</a> \nhas run across unusual surface features that carry a strong resemblance to stream banks on Earth.\n\nVisible in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16156\">above image</a>, \nfor example, is a small overhanging rock ledge that was quite possibly created by water erosion beneath.\n\nThe texture of the ledge appears to be a \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16189\">sedimentary conglomerate</a>, \nthe dried remains of many smaller rocks stuck together.\n\nBeneath the ledge are numerous small pebbles, possibly made smooth by tumbling in and around the once-flowing \n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/103211579003359376826/posts\">stream</a>.\n\nPebbles in the streambed likely fell there as the bank \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f62_MjB6-Ok\">eroded</a>. \n\nCircled at the upper right is a larger rock possibly also made smooth by \n<a href=\"ap101127.html\">stream</a> erosion.\n\nCuriosity has now discovered several indications of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVTyRNbsqk8\">dried streambeds on Mars</a> \non  \n<a href=\"ap120910.html\">its way</a> to its \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/09281210-glenelg-ho.html\">present location</a> where it \nwill be exploring the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenelg,_Mars\">unusual conjunction</a> \nof three different types of landscape.",
