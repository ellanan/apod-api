  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would this cluster of galaxy punch a hole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)?\n\nFirst, the \n<a href=\"https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_tests_cmb.html\">famous CMB</a> \nwas created by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)\">cooling gas</a> \nin the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe\">early universe</a> \nand flies right through most gas and dust in the universe.\n\nIt is <a href=\"ap130325.html\">all around us</a>.\n\nLarge \n<a href=\"ap100502.html\">clusters of galaxies</a> have enough gravity to contain very \n<a href=\"ap990404.html\">hot gas</a> -- gas hot enough to up-scatter microwave photons into light of significantly higher energy, thereby creating a hole in CMB maps.  \n\nThis <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyaev%E2%80%93Zel%27dovich_effect\">Sunyaev�Zel'dovich</a> (SZ) effect has been used for decades to \nreveal new information about hot gas in clusters and even to help discover galaxy clusters in a simple yet uniform way.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/419995/news20170317\">Pictured is the most detailed image</a> yet obtained of the \n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/sza/primer.html\">SZ effect</a>, now using both  \n<a href=\"http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma\">ALMA</a> to measure the CMB and the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nto measure the galaxies in the massive galaxy cluster \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PASJ...68...88K\">RX J1347.5-1145</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://aotw-pd.s3.amazonaws.com/Blue_Cat-No_Mac-big.jpg\">False-color blue</a> \ndepicts light from the \n<a href=\"https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/camb_tool/\">CMB</a>, while almost every yellow object is a galaxy. \n\nThe shape of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/hubble-cooperates-on-galaxy-cluster-and-cosmic-background\">SZ hole</a> indicates not only that hot gas is present in this galaxy cluster, but also that it is distributed in a surprisingly uneven manner.",
