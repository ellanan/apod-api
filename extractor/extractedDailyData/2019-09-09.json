  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow far can you see?\n\nThe most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, over two million \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MX3PIkbTQwQ\">light-years</a> away. \n\nWithout a telescope, even this immense \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral galaxy</a> \nappears as an unremarkable, faint, \n<a href=\"ap160322.html\">nebulous cloud</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)\">constellation Andromeda</a>. \n\nBut a bright yellow nucleus, dark winding dust lanes, luminous blue spiral arms, and bright red emission nebulas are recorded in \n<a href=\"http://amir.torgheh.ir/picture.php?/1237/category/14\">this stunning six-hour telescopic digital mosaic</a> of our closest major galactic neighbor.  \n\nWhile even \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/17/e0/6c/17e06cb8ddaa2fc90b7a416c0d0349ef--pugs-on-the-beach.jpg\">casual skygazers</a> are now inspired by the knowledge that there are many distant galaxies like M31, astronomers seriously debated this fundamental concept \n<a href=\"http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/history/archives/milestones-in-NAS-history/the-great-debate-of-1920.html\">only 100 years ago</a>. \n\nWere these \"spiral nebulae\" simply outlying gas clouds in our own \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> or were they \"island universes\" -- distant galaxies of stars comparable to the \n<a href=\"ap190617.html\">Milky Way</a> itself? \n\nThis question was central to the famous \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1920.html\">Shapley-Curtis debate of 1920</a>, \nwhich was later resolved by observations favoring Andromeda being just like our \n<a href=\"ap180729.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> -- a conclusion making \n<a href=\"ap180508.html\">the rest of the universe</a> \nmuch more vast than many had ever imagined.",
