  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is this planet so dark?\n\nPlanet\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrES-2b\">TrES-2b</a> reflects back less than one percent of the light it receives, making it darker than any known planet or moon, darker even than\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal\">coal</a>.\n\nJupiter-sized\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxCYKfjmW50\">TrES-2b</a> orbits extremely close to a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSC_03549-02811\">sun-like star</a> 750 light years away, and was discovered producing slight eclipses in 2006 using the modest 10-cm telescopes of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Atlantic_Exoplanet_Survey\">Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey</a> (TrES).\n\nThe alien world's strange darkness, however, was only\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...733...36K\">uncovered recently</a> by observations indicating its slight reflective glow by the Sun-orbiting\n<a href=\"ap090309.html\">Kepler satellite</a>.\n\nAn artist's drawing of planet is\n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2011/pr201121.html\">shown above</a>, complete with unsubstantiated speculation on possible moons.  \n\nReasons for <a href=\"http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=TrES-2\">TrES-2b</a>'s darkness remain unknown and are an active topic of research.",
