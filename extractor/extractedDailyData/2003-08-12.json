  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0414.html\">Stephan's\nQuintet</a> is a picturesque but clearly troubled\ngrouping of galaxies about 300 million light-years away\ntoward the high-flying constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/p/pegasus.html\">Pegasus</a>.\n\nSpanning over 200,000 light-years at that distance,\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/stephan/index.html\">this\ncomposite false-color image</a>\nillustrates the powerful nature of this\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302590\">multiple\ngalaxy collision</a>,\nshowing x-ray data from the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/whereis.html\">Chandra\nObservatory</a> in blue superposed on optical data in yellow.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory1_xray.html\">x-rays</a>\nfrom the central blue cloud running vertically\nthrough the image are produced by\ngas heated to millions of degrees by an energetic\nshock on a cosmic scale.\n\nThe shock was likely the result of the interstellar gas\nin the large spiral galaxy, seen immediately to the right\nof the cloud,\ncolliding with <a href=\"http://homepage.interaccess.com/~purcellm/\nngc7319.htm\">the quintet's</a> tenuous intergalactic gas\nas this galaxy plunged through group's central regions.\n\nIn fact, over billions of years, repeated passages of the\ngroup galaxies through the hot <a href=\"ap010309.html\">intergalactic\ngas</a> should progressively strip them of their own star\nforming material.\n\nIn this view, the large spiral galaxy just seen peeking\nabove the bottom edge is an unrelated foreground galaxy\na mere 35 million light-years distant.",
