  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat powers are being wielded in the Wizard Nebula?\n\nGravitation strong enough to form stars, and \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">stellar wind</a>s \nand radiations powerful enough to create and dissolve \n<a href=\"ap100328.html\">towers of gas</a>.\n\nLocated only 8,000 light years away, the Wizard nebula, \n<a href=\"http://www.stern-fan.de/Seiten/galerie_Bild_NGC7380-RGB.html\">pictured above</a>, surrounds developing open star cluster NGC 7380.\n\nVisually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_%28fantasy%29\">medieval sorcerer</a>.  \n\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7380\">active star forming region</a> spans 100 about light years, making it appear larger than the angular extent of the Moon.\n\nThe Wizard Nebula \n<a href=\"ap100909.html\">can be located</a> with a small telescope toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_%28constellation%29\">Cepheus</a>).\n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...71C\">nebula may</a> last only a few million years, some of the stars being formed may outlive our Sun.",
