  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's moving?\n\nTime lapse videos of the sky can be quite spectacular when they last long enough for\n<a href=\"ap110504.html\">stars</a>, planets,\n<a href=\"ap110328.html\">aurora</a>, and clouds to appear to move in just a few seconds.\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/37752523\">Pictured above</a>, however, astrovideographer\n<a href=\"http://www.elcielodecanarias.com/sobre%20mi.htm\">Daniel L�pez</a> not only treats us to several inspiring time lapse videos of the night sky, but shows us how he used sliders and motorized cranes to move the imaging cameras themselves, creating a thrilling three-dimensional sense of depth.\n\nThe video sequences were taken from\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R1aVKizySY\">Tenerife</a> on the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a> of Spain over the past two months, and show scenes including sunset shadows approaching\n<a href=\"http://www.iac.es/eno.php?op1=3&amp;lang=en\">Observatorio del Teide</a>, the Milky Way shifting as the sky rotates, bright planets\n<a href=\"ap120318.html\">Venus and trailing Jupiter</a> setting, a\n<a href=\"ap110228.html\">reddened Moon</a> rising through differing layers of\n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">atmospheric refraction</a>, the\n<a href=\"ap111014.html\">MAGIC gamma-ray telescopes</a> slewing to observe a new source, and unusual foreground objects including conic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echium_wildpretii\">Echium wildpretii</a> plants,  unusual rock formations, and a\n<a href=\"http://jerryandmartha.com/yourdailyart/images/catandbug.jpg\">spider</a> moving about its web.  \n\nThe video concludes by showing the\n<a href=\"ap100404.html\">Belt of Venus</a> descending on\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide\">Mt. Teide</a> as the morning sun rises.",
