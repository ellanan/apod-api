  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA cold wind blows from the central star of the Boomerang Nebula.\n\nSeen here in a detailed false-color image recorded in 1998 by\nthe <a href=\"http://hubble.esa.int/hubble/news/\nindex.cfm?oid=31442\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, the\nnebula lies about 5,000 light-years away towards the\ngrand southern constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/\nCentaurus.html\">of Centaurus</a>.\n\nThe symmetric cloud appears to have been created by a\nhigh-speed wind of gas and\ndust blowing from an aging central star at speeds\nof nearly 600,000 kilometers per hour.\n\nThis rapid expansion has cooled molecules in the nebular gas to\n<a href=\"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/tmp.html\">about one\ndegree above absolute zero</a> - colder than even the\n<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/Footprints.html\">cosmic\nbackground radiation</a> - \nmaking it the coldest region observed in\nthe distant <a href=\"ap030212.html\">Universe</a>.\n\nShining with light from the central star reflected by dust,\nthe frigid Boomerang Nebula\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E487L%2E155S&amp;db_key=AST\">is\nbelieved to be</a> a star or stellar system\n<a href=\"ap020807.html\">evolving toward</a> the\n<a href=\"ap020615.html\">planetary nebula phase</a>.",
