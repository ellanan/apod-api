  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow did the first stars form?\n\nTo help find out, the SPHINX computer simulation of \n<a href=\"ap210623.html\">star formation</a> \nin the very early universe was created, some results of which are shown in the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/q9ZCBR-onRw\">featured video</a>.\n\nTime since the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-powered-the-big-bang\">Big Bang</a> is shown in millions of years on the upper left. \n\nEven 100 million years after the \n<a href=\"https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/features/bigBangQandA.html\">Big Bang</a>, matter was spread \n<a href=\"https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/05/21042210_264995290674140_8840525631411191808_n.jpg\">too uniformly</a> across the cosmos for stars to be born. \n\nBesides <a href=\"ap180722.html\">background radiation</a>, the universe was dark.\n\nSoon, slight matter clumps rich in \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> gas begin to coalesce into the \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-stars-in-the-un/\">first stars</a>.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/BLnsYXEL1B0\">time-lapse video</a>, \npurple denotes gas, white denotes light, and gold shows radiation \nso energetic that it \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization\">ionizes</a> hydrogen, \nbreaking it up into charged electrons and protons. \n\nThe gold-colored regions also track the most massive stars that die with \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aysiMbgml5g\">powerful supernova</a>s.\n\nThe inset circle highlights a central region that is \n<a href=\"https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/science/firstLight.html\">becoming a galaxy</a>. \n\nThe simulation continues until the universe was about 550 million years old. \n\nTo assess the accuracy of the \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11624\">SPHINX simulations</a> \nand the assumptions that went into them, the results are not only being \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.3336L/abstract\">compared to current deep observations</a>, \nbut will also be compared with \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487.5902K/abstract\">more direct observations</a> of the early universe \nplanned with NASA's pending \n<a href=\"https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a>.",
