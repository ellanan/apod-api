  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would Mars appear to move backwards?  \n\nMost of the time, the apparent motion of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> in \n<a href=\"ap010827.html\">Earth's sky</a> is in one direction, \nslow but steady in front of the far distant stars. \n\nAbout every two years, however, the \n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">Earth passes Mars</a> \nas they orbit around the Sun.  \n\nDuring the most recent such pass in August, \n<a href=\"ap030828.html\">Mars loomed</a> particularly \n<a href=\"ap030827.html\">large and bright</a>.  \n\nAlso during this time, \nMars appeared to move backwards in the sky, \na phenomenon called \n<a href=\"http://alpha.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/retrograd.html\">retrograde motion</a>.  \n\nPictured above is a series of images digitally stacked \nso that all of the stars images coincide.  \n\nHere, Mars appears to \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allabout/nightsky/nightsky04.html\">trace out a loop</a> in the sky.  \n\nAt the top of the loop, Earth passed Mars and the \n<a href=\"http://astron.berkeley.edu/~ay7/html/homework/hw1/node3.html\">retrograde motion</a> was the highest.  \n\n<a href=\"ap011220.html\">Retrograde motion</a> can also be seen for other \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> planets.  \n\nIn fact, by coincidence, the dotted line to the \nright of the image center is Uranus\ndoing the same thing.",
