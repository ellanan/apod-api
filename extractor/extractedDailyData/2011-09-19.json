  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created the circular structure around the south pole of asteroid Vesta?\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14712\">Pictured above</a>, the bottom of the second largest object in the asteroid belt \nwas recently imaged for the first time by the robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_%28spacecraft%29\">Dawn satellite</a> that arrived last month.\n\nA close inspection of the 260-meter resolution image shows not only hills and \n<a href=\"ap110802.html\">craters</a> and \n<a href=\"ap110404.html\">cliffs</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzIw0c_MjTc\">more craters</a>, but ragged circular features that cover most of the lower right of the 500-kilometer sized object.\n\nEarly speculation posits that the structure might have been created by a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjP-L0HMoL4\">collision</a> and coalescence with a smaller asteroid.\n\nAlternatively, the features might have originated in an \n<a href=\"ap021028.html\">internal process</a> soon after the asteroid formed.\n\nNew clues might come in the next few months as \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00003165/\">Dawn spirals down</a> toward the rocky world and obtains images of increasingly high resolution.",
