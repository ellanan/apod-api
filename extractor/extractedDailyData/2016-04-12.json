  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes, a total eclipse is a good time to eye the Sun.\n\nTaking advantage of an unusual juxtaposition of \n<a href=\"ap150315.html\">Earth, Moon and Sun</a>, \nthe featured image depicts the total \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/solar.html\">solar eclipse</a> \nthat <a href=\"ap160310.html\">occurred last month</a> as it appeared -- nearly simultaneously -- \nfrom both Earth and space. \n\nThe innermost image shows the total \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html\">eclipse</a> from the ground, \nwith the central \n<a href=\"https://scienceeasylearning.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/eye-pupil.jpg\">pupil</a> created by the bright \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sun\">Sun</a> covered by a comparatively dark Moon. \n\nSurrounding the blocked solar disk is the \n<a href=\"ap090726.html\">tenuous corona</a> of Sun imaged in white light, \neasily visible from the ground only during an eclipse. \n\nNormally, this corona is hard to track far from the Sun, but the featured montage matches it to false-colored observations of the Sun from \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int\">ESA</a>'s space-based, Sun-orbiting, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory\">Solar and Heliospheric Observatory</a> (SOHO).\n\nObservations \n<a href=\"ap131111.html\">like this</a> \nallow the study of the constantly changing \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml\">magnetic activity</a> \nboth near and far from the Sun, \nthe same activity that ultimately drives \n<a href=\"ap130609.html\">Earth's auroras</a>.",
