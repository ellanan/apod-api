  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen a comet?  \n\nComets bright enough to be visible to the unaided eye appear only \n<a href=\"ap040503.html\">every few years</a>.  \n\nRight now, however, a new comet has brightened unexpectedly and is \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1684_1.asp\">visible as a faint streak</a> to the unaided northern observer in the eastern morning sky just before sunrise.   \n\nBinoculars may help.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/060224_night_sky.html\">Comet Pojmanski</a>, officially designated C/2006 A1 and discovered only in January, now sports a turquoise tail several times longer than the full moon.   \n\n<a href=\"ap060303.html\">Comet Pojmanski</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap980717.html\">ion tail</a> is due to gas particles expelled by the comet being pushed away from the Sun by the \n<a href=\"http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/sun_wind.htm\">solar wind</a>, \nthe same wind that ionizes gas in the tail causing its blue tint.   \n\n<a href=\"http://www.schursastrophotography.com/10dastro/pojmansky022706.html\">Pictured above</a> as it appeared only last week, \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2006A1.html\">Comet Pojmanski</a> has now begun to fade as its \norbit around the Sun takes \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2006_A1_Pojma%C5%84ski\">it</a> further from the Earth.",
