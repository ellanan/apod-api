  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Sun always rise in the same direction? \n\nNo. \n\nAs the months change, the direction toward the rising Sun changes, too. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158500208776988&amp;id=550676987\">featured image</a> shows the direction of sunrise \nevery month during 2019 as seen from near the city of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/f2pS-hpOny0\">Amman</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan\">Jordan</a>. \n\nThe camera in the image is always facing due east, \nwith north toward the left and south toward the right. \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question14.html\">Sun always rises in the east</a> in general, \nit rises furthest to the south of east on the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_solstice\">December solstice</a>, \nand furthest north of east on the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_solstice\">June solstice</a>.\n\nToday is the \n<a href=\"ap190923.html\">December solstice</a>, the day of least sunlight in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere\">Northern Hemisphere</a> and of most sunlight in the \n<a href=\"ap021222.html\">Southern Hemisphere</a>. \n\nIn many countries, the \n<a href=\"ap191222.html\">December Solstice</a> is considered an official change in season: \nfor example the first day of \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/events/2020/12/21/winter-solstice-in-the-northern-hemisphere/\">winter in the North</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cats-worshiping-sun-2-59310b640b69f__605.jpg\">Solar heating</a> and stored energy in the \nEarth's surface and atmosphere are \n<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/why-february-cold\">near their lowest</a> \nduring winter, making the winter months usually the coldest of the year. \n\nOn the brighter side, in the north, \n<a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/changing-daylight-patterns/\">daylight hours will now increase</a> every day from until June.",
