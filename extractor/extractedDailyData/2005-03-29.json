  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it be like to see a sky with many moons?  \n\nSuch is the sky above \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nWhen appearing close to each other, moons will show a similar \n<a href=\"http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html\">phase</a>.\n\nA view with two of the more famous moons of \n<a href=\"saturn.html\">Saturn</a> in crescent \n<a href=\"ap040829.html\">phase</a> was captured last month by the \n<a href=\"http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/groups/rv/homepage.html\">robot</a> spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">Cassini</a> now orbiting Saturn.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan\">Titan</a>, \non the lower left, is among the largest moons in the \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html\">Solar System</a> and is perpetually shrouded in clouds.  \n\nRecently, the Huygens probe \n<a href=\"ap050117.html\">landed on Titan</a> \nand gave humanity its first view of its unusual surface.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/dione.html\">Dione</a>, \non the upper right, has less than a quarter of \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/titan.htm\">Titan</a>'s \ndiameter and has no significant atmosphere. \n\n<a href=\"ap041201.html\">Dione</a>, \nalthough appearing smaller, was only half the distance to \nTitan when the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06607\">above image</a> was taken.",
