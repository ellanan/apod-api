  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat wonders appear when the Moon blocks the Sun?\n\nFor many eager observers of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/\">Monday’s total eclipse</a> of the Sun, the suddenly dark sky \nincluded the expected corona and two (perhaps surprise) planets: \n<a href=\"ap230306.html\">Venus and Jupiter</a>.\n\nNormally, in recent days, Venus is visible only in the morning when the Sun and Jupiter are below the horizon, while Jupiter appears bright only in the evening. \n\nOn Monday, though, for well-placed observers, both planets became easily visible during the day right in line with the \n<a href=\"ap240409.html\">totally eclipsed Sun</a>.\n\nThis line was captured Monday afternoon in the featured image from \n<a href=\"https://www.arkansasstateparks.com/parks/mount-nebo-state-park\">Mount Nebo</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas\">Arkansas</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>, \nalong with a line of \n<a href=\"https://www.temptationstreats.com/sites/g/files/fnmzdf3061/files/2023-02/curious-owners-hero_0.jpg\">curious observers</a> — and a \n<a href=\"ap231015.html\">picturesque tree</a>.",
