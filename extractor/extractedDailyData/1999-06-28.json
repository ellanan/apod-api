  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAre Martians trying to tell us something?  \nAn indentation has been \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/index.html\">recently photographed</a> on \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a> that resembles a heart, a common human symbol for love.  \n\nBecause intelligent Martians have never been known to exist, \nand because <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/3_23_99_pavonis/index.html\">formations with similarities</a> have been found \nthat clearly result from \n<a href=\"ap980406.html\">natural</a> \n<a href=\"ap980416.html\">phenomena</a>, \nthe pit <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/6_17_99_heart/index.html\">shown above</a> is thought not to be a form of \n<a href=\"ap990517.html\">interplanetary communication</a>.  \n\nMany scientists believe instead that the \nright-most wall of the two-kilometer \nwide heart-shaped pit was created by a \n<a href=\"ap990315.html\">naturally occurring</a> \n<a href=\"http://glsun2.gl.rhbnc.ac.uk/PHD/3df.html\">graben</a>, \na surface drop caused by expansion along a fault-line.  \n\nPerhaps <a href=\"http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~keith/poems/count.html\">love</a> is easier to find here on \n<a href=\"ap990131.html\">Earth</a>.",
