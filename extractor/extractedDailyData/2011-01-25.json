  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is causing the picturesque ripples of supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5?\n\nThe ripples, as well as the greater nebula, were\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/27/image/\">imaged</a> in unprecedented detail by the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nin 2006 and again late last year.  \n\nThe red color was recoded by a Hubble filter that left only the light emitted by\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">energetic hydrogen</a>.\n\nThe precise reason for the ripples remains unknown, with two considered origin hypotheses relating them to relatively dense portions of either ejected or impacted gas.  \n\nThe reason for the broader\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/27/\">red glowing ring</a>\nis more clear, with expansion speed and light echos relating it to a classic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1a_supernova\">Type Ia supernova</a>\nexplosion that must have occurred about 400 years earlier.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...680.1149B\">SNR 0509</a>\ncurrently spans about 23\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a>\nand lies about 160,000 light years away toward the constellation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coryphaenidae\">dolphinfish</a>\n(<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/dorado.htm\">Dorado</a>) in the\n<a href=\"ap100514.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.\n\nThe expanding ring carries with it another great mystery, \nhowever: why wasn't this\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZkAoR3WLE&amp;f\">supernova</a>\nseen 400 years ago when light from the initial blast should have passed the Earth?",
