  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are there faint rings around this spiral galaxy?\n\nPossibly because the galaxy,\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2010/24/caption.html\">NGC 4911</a>, is being pulled at by its neighbors as it falls into the enormous\n<a href=\"ap100502.html\">Coma Cluster of Galaxies</a>.\n\nIf NGC 4911 ends up like most of the galaxies in the\ncentral Coma cluster, it will become  a yellowish\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a>,\nlosing not only its outer layers, but dust, gas, and its cadre of surrounding\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html\">satellite galaxies</a> as well.\n\nCurrently, however,  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution\">this process</a> is just beginning.\n\nVisible in the <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1024a/\">above deep image</a> from the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpkrVw_E6Nw\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> are NGC 4911's bright nucleus, distorted spiral arms laced with dark dust, clusters of recently formed stars, unusual faint outer rings, dwarf companion galaxies, and even faint\n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular clusters</a> of stars.\n\nFar in the <a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18004\">distance</a> many <a href=\"ap040309.html\">unassociated galaxies</a>\nfrom the early <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N\">universe</a> are visible, some even through\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4911\">NGC 4911</a> itself.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4443\">Coma Cluster</a> contains over 1,000 galaxies making it among the most massive objects known.\n\nNGC 4911 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comacl_zentrum600.png\">can be found</a> to the lower left of the great cluster's center.",
