  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does the solar wind sound like?\n\nA <a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml\">wind</a> \nof fast moving particles blows out from \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">our Sun</a>, and although \n<a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/sound-can-travel-through-space-after-all-but-we-can-t-hear-it\">space transmits sound poorly</a>, \nparticle impact and variable-field data from \nNASA's near-Sun \n<a href=\"http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/\">Parker Solar Probe</a> \nis being translated into  \n<a href=\"ap190710.html\">sound</a>.\n\nThe disarming audio track of the featured video recounts several of \n<a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/FeatureStory/200114\">these reverberations</a>, \nincluding spooky-sounding <a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/images/featurestory/20200114/psp_langmuir_waves.mp3\">Langmuir Waves</a> (heard first), hurricane-sounding \n<a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/images/featurestory/20200114/psp_whistler_mode_waves_1.mp3\">Whistler</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/images/featurestory/20200114/psp_whistler_mode_waves_2.mp3\">Mode Waves</a> (heard next), and hard-to-describe <a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/images/featurestory/20200114/psp_dispersive_chirping_waves_2.mp3\">Dispersive</a> <a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/images/featurestory/20200114/psp_dispersive_chirping_waves_1.mp3\">Chirping Waves</a> (heard last).\n\nAlso impressive is the video's time-lapse visual track which shows \n<a href=\"ap191209.html\">Parker's view</a> to the side of its sun shield, \nand where the planets \n<a href=\"ap191012.html\">Earth</a>, \n<a href=\"ap190205.html\">Jupiter</a>, \n<a href=\"ap170723.html\">Mercury</a> and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/\">Venus</a> \nappear in succession, interspersed with bursts of \n<a href=\"ap180902.html\">powerful cosmic rays</a> \nimpacting the imager. \n\nThe nature of the solar wind near Mercury is \n<a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/FeatureStory/200114\">surprisingly different</a> \nfrom near the Earth, and \n<a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/VbnUQpnihPSIgIXuZv/giphy.gif\">much study</a> is underway to better understand the differences.",
