  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow was this picture taken?\n\nUsually, pictures of the shuttle, taken from space, are snapped from the space station.  \n\nCommonly, pictures of the\n<a href=\"ap110309.html\">space station</a> are snapped from the\n<a href=\"ap090513.html\">shuttle</a>.\n\nHow, then, can there be a picture of both the\n<a href=\"ap021020.html\">shuttle and the station</a> together, taken from space?\n\nThe answer is that during the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/endeavour-info.html\">Space Shuttle Endeavour</a>'s last trip to the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">International Space Station</a> two weeks ago, a\n<a href=\"ap070423.html\">supply ship</a> departed the station with astronauts that captured a\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-27/inflight/ndxpage40.html\">series</a> <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-27/inflight/ndxpage41.html\">of</a> <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-27/inflight/ndxpage42.html\">rare</a> <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-27/inflight/ndxpage43.html\">views</a>.\n\nThe supply ship was the Russian\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-20\">Soyuz TMA-20</a> which landed in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan\">Kazakhstan</a>\nlater that day.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-27/html/iss027e036710.html\">above spectacular image</a> well captures the relative sizes of the station and docked shuttle.  \n\nFar below, clouds of Earth are\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1969.html\">seen</a> above a blue sea.\n\nThe next and last\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FROxZ5i67k\">launch</a> of a US space shuttle is <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/index.html\">scheduled</a> for early July.",
