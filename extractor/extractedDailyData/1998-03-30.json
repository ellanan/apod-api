  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan one galaxy hide behind another?  Not in the case of \n<a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/ceres/1938/1938.html\">B1938+666</a>.  \n\nHere the foreground galaxy acts like a huge \n<a href=\"ap970503.html\">gravitational lens</a>, \npulling the light from the background object around it, \nkeeping it visible.  Here the alignment is so precise \nthat the distant galaxy is distorted into a nearly \nperfect giant ring around the foreground galaxy, \na formation known as an <a href=\"http://www.iam.ubc.ca/spider/newbury/lenses/Einstein_rings.html\">Einstein ring</a>.  \n\nThe bright peak at the \ncenter of the bulls-eye is the nearer galaxy.  \nThe <a href=\"http://vela.astro.ulg.ac.be/themes/extragal/gravlens/bibdat/engl/index.html\">cosmic mirage</a> was found initially with the <a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/about/layman/merlin.html\">MERLIN radio telescope array</a>.  The follow-up image shown above from the \n<a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> was\n<a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/press/PR9801/press.html\">released</a> earlier today.  \n\nAlthough appearing extremely small at 1 <a href=\"http://proxima.astro.virginia.edu/~pai/Text/coords/subsection4_1.html\">arcsecond</a> diameter, the above <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/nslens_effects.html\">Einstein ring</a> is really tens of thousands of light years across.",
