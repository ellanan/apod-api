  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap051029.html\">Close-up</a> images of NGC 3242\nshow the cast off shroud of a\ndying, sun-like star fancifully known as The Ghost of Jupiter nebula.\n\nBut this deep and\n<a href=\"http://www.chart32.de/component/k2/planetaty/ngc3242\">wide\ntelescopic view</a> also finds the seldom seen\nouter halo of the beautiful planetary nebula at the upper left,\ntoward Milky Way stars and background galaxies in the serpentine\nconstellation Hydra.\n\nIntense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation\nfrom the nebula's central white dwarf star powers its illusive\nglow in visible light.\n\n<a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/spider/Misc/n3242.html\">In fact</a>,\nplanets of NGC 3242's evolved white dwarf star may have\ncontributed to the nebula's symmetric features and shape.\n\nActivity beginning in the star's red giant phase,\nlong before it produced a planetary nebula, is likely\nthe cause of the fainter more extensive halo.\n\nAbout a light-year across NGC 3242 is some 4,500\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10721\">light-years away</a>.\n\nThe tenuous clouds of glowing material at the right could\nwell be interstellar gas,\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/galex/galex-20090403.html\">by\nchance close enough</a> to the\nNGC 3242's white dwarf to be energized by its ultraviolet\nradiation.",
