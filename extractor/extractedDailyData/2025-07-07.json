  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt came from outer space. \n\nAn object from outside \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/\">our Solar System</a> is now passing through at high speed.\n\nClassified as a comet because of its gaseous coma, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3I/ATLAS\">3I/ATLAS</a> is \n<a href=\"ap171122.html\">only</a> \n<a href=\"ap191018.html\">the</a> third identified \nmacroscopic object as being \n<a href=\"https://www.swri.org/newsroom/press-releases/ibex-spacecraft-measures-alien-particles-outside-solar-system-reveals-interactions-surrounding-regions\">so alien</a>.\n\nThe comet's trajectory is shown in white on the \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3I-ATLAS_trajectory_Jul_2025.jpg\">featured map</a>, where the orbits of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>, \n<a href=\"ap240909.html\">Mars</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap130331.html\">Earth</a> are shown in gold, red, and blue.\n\nCurrently <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/ESA_tracks_rare_interstellar_comet\">Comet 3I/ATLAS</a> is about the distance of Jupiter from the Sun -- \nbut closing, with its closest approach to our Sun \nexpected to be within the orbit of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/\">Mars</a> in late October.\n\nExpected to pass near both Mars and Jupiter, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/\">3I/ATLAS</a> is not expected to pass close to the Earth. \n\nThe origin of Comet 3I/ATLAS \n<a href=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/04/08/24/cat-4451003_1280.jpg\">remains unknown</a>.\n\nAlthough initial activity indicates a \n<a href=\"ap250128.html\">relatively normal comet</a>, \nfuture observations about \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-vzafaw0t08\">3I/ATLAS</a>' \ncomposition and nature will surely continue.",
