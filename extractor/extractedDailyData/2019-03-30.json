  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars3d/3DGlasses.cfm\">Put on your red/cyan\nglasses</a> and float next to the jagged and double-lobed nucleus of\nChuryumov-Gerasimenko, also known as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/\nChuryumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet 67P</a>.\n\nThe stereo anaglyph was created by combining two images from the\n<a href=\"ap141016.html\">Rosetta spacecraft's</a>\nnarrow angle OSIRIS camera\n<a href=\"https://rosetta-3dcomet.cnes.fr/?q=en/content/\nanag-nac2015-07-25t062848742zid301397549500f22nac2015-07-25t063846772zid301397549400f22p1s63\">taken on July 25, 2015</a> from a distance of\n184 kilometers.\n\nNumerous jets are emanating from the small solar system world's active\nsurface near its closest approach to the Sun.\n\nThe larger lobe is around 4 kilometers in diameter, joined to a\nsmaller, 2.5 kilometer diameter lobe by a narrow neck.\n\nRosetta's mission to the comet ended in September 2016 when\nthe spacecraft was commanded to a controlled impact with the\n<a href=\"https://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/news/\nfinal-descent-images-rosetta-spacecraft\">comet's surface</a>.\n\nKeep those 3D glasses on though.\n\nYou can check out a\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02324\">new catalog</a>\nof nearly 1400 stereo anaglyphs created\nfrom <a href=\"https://rosetta-3dcomet.cnes.fr/?q=en\">Rosetta image\ndata on this website.</a>",
