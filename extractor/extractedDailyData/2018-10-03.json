  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nJewels don't shine this bright -- only stars do.\n\nAnd almost every spot in this \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOJVc3KtaI\">glittering \njewel</a>-box of an image from the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> is a star.\n\nNow some stars are more red than our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>, and some more blue -- but all of them are much farther away. \n\nAlthough it takes light about 8 minutes to reach \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> from the Sun, \nNGC 1898 is so far away that it takes light about 160,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">years</a> to get here.\n\nThis \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1840a/zoomable/\">huge ball of stars, NGC 1898</a>, is called a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\">globular cluster</a> and resides in the \n<a href=\"ap180516.html\">central bar</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap180428.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> (LMC) -- a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_galaxies_of_the_Milky_Way#List\">satellite galaxy</a> of our large \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/milkyway.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1840a/\">featured multi-colored image</a> includes light from the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet</a> \nand was taken to help determine if the \n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=13435\">stars of NGC 1898</a> all formed at the same time, or at different times.\n\nThere are increasing indications that most \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26ARv..20...50G\">globular clusters formed stars in stages</a>, and that, in particular, \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426.1884C\">stars from NGC 1898 formed</a> shortly after \n<a href=\"ap160725.html\">ancient encounter</a>s with the \n<a href=\"ap100903.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> (SMC) and our Milky Way Galaxy.",
