  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat has created a large dust ring around Saturn?\n\nAt over 200 times the radius of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>\nand over 50 times the radius of Saturn's expansive\n<a href=\"ap070327.html\">E ring</a>, the\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08515.pdf\">newly discovered dust ring</a> is the largest planetary ring yet imaged.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/07/spitzer-sees-giant-ring-around-saturn/\">ring</a> was found in infrared light by the Earth-trailing \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_space_telescope\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.  \n\nA leading hypothesis for its origin is impact material ejected from Saturn's moon\n<a href=\"ap060212.html\">Phoebe</a>, which orbits right through the <a href=\"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/pom/archive.php?year=2009&amp;month=10\">dust ring</a>'s middle.  \n\nAn additional possibility is that the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/spitzer-20091007v.html\">dust ring</a> supplies the\nmysterious material that coats part of Saturn's moon\n<a href=\"ap090809.html\">Iapetus</a>, which orbits near the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9LbL0QjxdU\">dust ring</a>'s inner edge.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2009-19/ssc2009-19a.shtml\">Pictured above</a> in the inset, part of the dust ring\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/?IDNumber=pia12259\">appears</a> as false-color orange in front of numerous background stars.",
