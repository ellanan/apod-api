  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen the band of our Milky Way Galaxy? \n\nIn a clear sky from a dark location at the right time, a faint band of light becomes visible across the sky. \n\nSoon after your eyes become \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)\">dark adapted</a>, \nyou might spot the band for the first time.  \n\nIt may then become obvious.  \n\nThen <a href=\"ap080929.html\">spectacular</a>.  \n\nOne reason for a growing astonishment might be the realization that this \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_DWXWStbXg\">fuzzy swath</a> \ncontains billions of stars and is the disk of our \n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">very own</a> \n<a href=\"ap061126.html\">spiral galaxy</a>. \n\nSince we are inside this disk, the \n<a href=\"ap070508.html\">band appears</a> to encircle the Earth. \n\nVisible in the above image, high above in the night sky, the \n<a href=\"ap070930.html\">band of the Milky Way Galaxy</a> arcs.\n\nThe bright spot just below the band is the planet Jupiter.  \n\nIn the foreground lies the moonlit caldera of the volcano \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakala\">Haleakala</a>, \nlocated on the island of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui\">Maui</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii\">Hawaii</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.  \n\nA close look near the horizon will reveal light clouds and the dark but enormous \n<a href=\"ap051220.html\">Mauna Kea</a> volcano on the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)\">Big Island</a> of Hawaii.  \n\nIf you have never seen the Milky Way band or recognized the \n<a href=\"ap081203.html\">planet Jupiter</a>, this year may be your chance.  \n\nBecause 2009 is the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy2009.org/\">International Year of Astronomy</a>, \nan opportunity to look through a \n<a href=\"ap050413.html\">window that peers deep into the universe</a> \nmay be coming to a location near you.",
