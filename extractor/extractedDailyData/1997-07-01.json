  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYou're zipping through the Solar System when you pass ... \nasteroid 253 Mathilde.  This actually happened to NASA's \n<a href=\"http://hurlbut.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Education/intro/NEARintro.html\">NEAR spacecraft</a> just last Friday.   The \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Mathilde/images.html\">above picture</a> of the previously unresolved \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a> was \n<a href=\"ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/1997/97-147.txt\">released just yesterday</a>.   Mathilde's large craters and \nirregular shape indicates that it has undergone huge collisions \nwith other large space rocks in the past.   \n<a href=\"http://hurlbut.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Education/intro/mathilde.html\">Mathilde</a> has more large craters than asteroids \n<a href=\"ap970629.html\">243 Ida</a> and \n<a href=\"ap951020.html\">951 Gaspra</a>, \nwhich were photographed by the \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/\">Galileo spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/jupiter.htm\">Jupiter</a>.\nIn the image center is a crater over 20 kilometers across.  \n<a href=\"http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu:80/sbnhtml/\">Asteroids</a> \nare rare enough so that spacecraft traveling through even the \n<a href=\"http://ispec.ucsd.edu/student-pages/asteroids/\">main \nasteroid belt</a> need not fear colliding with any - let alone \none as large as \n<a href=\"ap970630.html\">Mathilde</a>.",
