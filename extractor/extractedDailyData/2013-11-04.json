  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA sunrise over New York City rarely looks like this.\n\nYesterday, however, the Sun rose partly \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/105651/rare-hybrid-solar-eclipse-on-november-3-2013-how-to-see-it/\">eclipsed by the Moon</a> \nas seen from much of the eastern North American and northern South America. \n\nSimultaneously, much of Africa, already well into daytime, saw the \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">eclipse</a> from beginning to end.\n\nThe eclipse was unusual in that it was a \n<a href=\"ap131103.html\">hybrid</a> -- parts of the Earth saw the Moon as too angularly small to cover the whole Sun, and so at maximum coverage left the \n<a href=\"ap980824.html\">Sun surrounded</a> by a \n<a href=\"ap090125.html\">ring a fire</a>, \nwhile other parts of the Earth saw the Moon as \nlarge enough to cover the entire Sun, \nand so at maximum coverage witnessed a \n<a href=\"ap090726.html\">total solar eclipse</a>.\n\nSlight changes in the \n<a href=\"ap121129.html\">angular size of the Moon</a> \nas seen from the Earth's surface are caused by the non-flatness of the Earth and the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening\">ellipticity</a> of the Moon's orbit. \n\nPictured above, the famous \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building\">Empire State Building</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.beautyofnyc.org/\">New York City</a> \nis seen to the left of the \n<a href=\"ap120520.html\">partially eclipsed Sun</a>, adorned with scenic clouds.\n\nThe next solar \n<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/new-york\">eclipse visible from New York</a> \nCity -- a very slight eclipse -- will occur during the sunset of 2014 \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_23\">October 23</a>.",
