  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the dark dust of interstellar space has an angular elegance. \n\nSuch is the case toward the far-south \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleon\">constellation of Chamaeleon</a>.\n\nNormally <a href=\"ap180628.html\">too faint to see</a>, dark dust is best known for blocking visible light from stars and galaxies behind it.\n\nIn <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/29679880@N05/51806716079/\">this four-hour exposure</a>, however, \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/hiroc/47807534932\">the dust</a> is seen mostly in light of its own, \nwith its strong red and near-<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> \ncolors giving creating a brown hue.\n\nContrastingly blue, the bright star \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Chamaeleontis\">Beta Chamaeleontis</a> \nis visible just to the right of center, with the dust that surrounds it preferentially reflecting blue light from its primarily blue-white color. \n\nAll of the <a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=42126&amp;start=25#p319709\">pictured stars</a> and dust occur in our own Milky Way Galaxy with -- but one \n<a href=\"https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/09/28/startled-cat-5.jpg\">notable exception</a>: the white spot just \n<a href=\"http://www.werbeagentur.org/oldwexi/gallery.html\">below Beta Chamaeleontis</a> is the galaxy IC 3104 which lies far in the distance. \n\n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">Interstellar dust</a> is mostly created in the cool atmospheres of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant\">giant stars</a> \nand dispersed into space by stellar light, \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">stellar winds</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stellar_explosion_types\">stellar explosions</a> such as \n<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/interstellar-dust-may-come-supernovae-after-all\">supernovas</a>.",
