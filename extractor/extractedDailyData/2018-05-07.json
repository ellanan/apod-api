  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is there a large boulder near the center of Tycho's peak?\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_(lunar_crater)\">Tycho crater</a> on \n<a href=\"ap180318.html\">the Moon</a> is one of the easiest features to see, \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">visible</a> even to the unaided eye (inset, lower right). \n\nBut at the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/lro-tycho.html\">center of Tycho</a> (inset, upper left) is a something unusual -- a 120-meter boulder.  \n\nThis boulder was imaged at very high resolution \n<a hre=\"ap130104.html\">at sunrise</a>, over the past decade, \nby the Moon-circling \n<a href=\"https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO). \n\nThe leading origin hypothesis is that that the boulder was thrown during the \n<a href=\"ap140113.html\">tremendous collision</a> that formed Tycho crater about 110 million years ago, and by chance came back down right near the center of the \n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/384\">newly-formed central mountain</a>.\n\nOver the next billion years meteor impacts and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/15mar_moonquakes\">moonquakes</a> should slowly degrade \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfmQh_yDRBo\">Tycho</a>'s center, likely causing the central boulder to tumble 2000 meters down to the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc-20100114-tycho.html\">crater floor</a> and disintegrate.",
