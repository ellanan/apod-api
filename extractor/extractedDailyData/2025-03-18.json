  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere is no sea on Earth large enough to contain the Shark nebula.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/endoceansharks/\">predator</a> \napparition poses us no danger as it is composed only of interstellar gas and \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html\">dust</a>.\n\nDark dust like that \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/6ekkcw/\">featured here</a> \nis somewhat like cigarette smoke and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust#Dust_grain_formation\">created</a> \nin the cool atmospheres of giant \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/\">stars</a>.\n\nAfter expelling gas and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbdwTwB8jtc\">gravitationally recondensing</a>, massive stars may \n<a href=\"ap221020.html\">carve intricate structures</a> \ninto their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">stellar wind</a>s as sculpting tools. \n\nThe heat they generate evaporates the murky \n<a href=\"ap230129.html\">molecular cloud</a> as well as \ncausing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red. \n\nDuring disintegration, we \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">humans</a> can enjoy\n<a href=\"ap120124.html\">imagining</a> these \n<a href=\"ap141008.html\">great clouds</a> as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia\">common icons</a>, like we do for <a href=\"https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/\">water clouds</a> \non Earth.\n\nIncluding <a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1509/shark_toet_1000_anno.jpg\">smaller dust nebulae</a> such as Van den Bergh 149 &amp; 150, the \n<a href=\"https://www.galactic-hunter.com/post/the-shark-nebula\">Shark nebula</a>, sometimes cataloged as LDN 1235,  \nspans about 15 light years and lies about 650 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light years</a> \naway toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation)\">Cepheus</a>).",
