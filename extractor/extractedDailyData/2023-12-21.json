  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/a2w8fr/C/\">Distant galaxies abound in this</a>\none degree wide field of view toward\nthe southern constellation Grus (The Crane).\n\nBut the three spiral galaxies at the lower right are quite striking.\n\nIn fact, all three galaxies are grouped about 70 million light years away\nand sometimes known as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grus_(constellation)#Deep-sky_objects\">the Grus Triplet</a>.\n\nThey share the pretty telescopic frame, recorded on December 13,\nwith the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/\">comet</a>\ndesignated\n<a href=\"http://astro.vanbuitenen.nl/comet/2020V2\">C/2020 V2 ZTF</a>.\n\nNow outbound from the inner Solar System and swinging below\nthe ecliptic plane in a\n<a href=\"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=C%2F2020%20V2\">hyperbolic</a>\norbit, the comet was about 29 light-minutes from our fair planet in this image.\n\nAnd though this comet ZTF was brighter when it was\nclosest to the Sun last May and closest to Earth in September of 2023,\nit still shines in telescopes pointed toward southern night skies,\nremaining almost as bright as the Grus Triplet galaxies.",
