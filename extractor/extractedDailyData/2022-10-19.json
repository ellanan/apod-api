  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo we dare believe our eyes? \n\nWhen we look at images of space, we often wonder whether they are \"real\", \nand just as often the best answer varies. \n\nIn this case, the scene appears much as our eyes would see it, because it\nwas obtained using  \n<a href=\"https://www.peterzelinka.com/blog/2020/2/a-guide-to-astrophotography-filters\">RGB (Red, Green, Blue)</a> filters like the \n<a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/cones\">cone cells in our eyes</a>, except collecting light for 19 hours, \nnot a fraction of a second. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/536qqv/\">featured image</a> \nwas captured over six nights, using a \n<a href=\"https://cosmicpursuits.com/943/telescopes-explained/\">24-inch diameter</a> telescope \n<a href=\"https://www.sierra-remote.com/\">in</a> the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/udqzLBbY2wg\">Sierra Nevada Mountains</a>, in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nThe bright <a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/spiral+galaxy\">spiral galaxy</a> at the center (NGC 7497) looks like \nit is being grasped by an eerie tendril of a \n<a href=\"ap201026.html\">space ghost</a>, and therein lies the trick.\n\nThe galaxy is actually 59 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> away, while the nebulosity is MBM 54, \nless than one thousand light years away, making it \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...346..232W/abstract\">one of the nearest cool clouds of gas and dust</a> -- \n<a href=\"https://www.cosmotography.com/images/galactic_cirrus.html\">galactic cirrus</a> -- within our own \n<a href=\"ap220817.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nBoth are in the constellation of \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/images/detail/peg/\">Pegasus</a>, which \n<a href=\"https://skymaps.com/skymaps/tesmn2210.pdf\">can be seen</a> high overhead from northern latitudes in the autumn.",
