  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nGalaxies don't normally look like this.  \n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2000nov2/ngc6745story.html\">NGC 6745</a> actually shows the results of \ntwo galaxies that have been\n<a href=\"ap990722.html\">colliding</a> for only \nhundreds of millions of years.  \n\nJust off the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2000/2000/34/image/a/\">above photograph</a> to the lower right is the smaller galaxy, \nmoving away.  \n\nThe larger galaxy, \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2000nov2/ngc6745table.html\">pictured above</a>, used to be a \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nbut now is damaged and appears \n<a href=\"ap980315.html\">peculiar</a>. \n\nGravity has distorted the shapes of the galaxies.  \n\nAlthough it is likely that no stars in the two \n<a href=\"ap061024.html\">galaxies directly collided</a>, the gas, \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a>, and ambient \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html\">magnetic fields</a> do interact directly.\n\nIn fact, a <a href=\"http://www.mckinnonsc.vic.edu.au/school/ties/ties.htm\">knot</a> of gas pulled off the larger galaxy \non the lower right has now begun to form stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6745\">NGC 6745</a> \nspans about 80 thousand light-years across and is located about 200 million \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/question94.htm\">light-years</a> away.",
