  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that rising from the clouds?  \n\nThe space shuttle.\n\nSometimes, if you looked out the window of an airplane at just the right place and time, you could have seen something very unusual -- a space shuttle launching to orbit.  \n\n<a href=\"http://twitpic.com/4yg4ur\">Images</a> of the rising shuttle and its plume became widely circulated over the web shortly after \n<a href=\"ap110518.html\">Endeavour's final launch</a> in 2011 May.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-134/html/sts134-s-061.html\">above image</a> was taken from a shuttle training aircraft by NASA and is not \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\">copyrighted</a>.\n\nTaken well above the clouds, the image can be matched with similar images of the same shuttle plume taken \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-134/html/sts134-s-013.html\">below the clouds</a>.  \n\nHot glowing gasses expelled by the engines are visible near the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X47raRdRSBA\">rising shuttle</a>, as well as a long smoke plume.  \n\nA <a href=\"ap070603.html\">shadow of the plume</a> appears on the cloud deck, indicating the direction of the Sun.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html\">US Space Shuttle program</a> concluded in 2011, and \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/subject/3439/\">Endeavour</a> can now be \n<a href=\"ap121022.html\">visited</a> at the \n<a href=\"http://californiasciencecenter.org/exhibits/air-space/space-shuttle-endeavour\">California Science Center</a>.",
