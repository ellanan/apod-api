  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Could this fuzzy blob be the key to the whole\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">gamma-ray burst (GRB) mystery</a>?\nAstronomers the world over are now scrambling to determine the\ntrue nature of the extended emission seen to the lower right of\nthe bright source in the <a href=\"http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast31mar97_1.htm\">above image</a>.\n The bright object in the center is rapidly fading - and thought\nto be the <a href=\"ap970319.html\">first true optical counterpart to a GRB</a>.\n But is it housed in a <a href=\"ap970322.html\">galaxy</a>?  If\nso, after the central emission has faded, this galaxy should be\nidentifiable.  Today, follow up observations of this blob are\nplanned with the <a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n If the extended emission does come from a galaxy it would bolster\nindications that the <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/10/PR.html\">February 28th GRB</a>\noccurred in that galaxy,  across the universe from us.   This,\nin turn, would imply that <a href=\"ap961123.html\">GRBs</a> are\ntruly the most powerful explosions ever known.",
