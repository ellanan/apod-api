  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nStars are forming in a dense\n<a href=\"http://loke.as.arizona.edu/~ckulesa/research/\noverview.html\">molecular cloud</a> a mere 1,000 light-years\naway in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens\">Serpens</a> Cauda\n(The Serpent's Tail).\n\nAt that estimated distance, this sharp, near-infrared close-up of the\nactive Serpens star-forming region spans about 2\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\ncosmic_reference/angular.html\">arcminutes</a>\nor just over half a light-year.\n\nThough such\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\nir_tutorial/irregions.html\">near-infrared</a>\nobservations can be made by mountain-top\ntelescopes with specialized detectors, near-infrared\nlight has too long a <a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/\nems/index.html\">wavelength</a> to be visible to the eye.\n\nThis view was recorded with a sensitive camera,\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2007/\npr-36-07.html\">HAWK-I</a>\n(High Acuity, Wide field K-band Imaging), just commissioned at the\n<a href=\"ap061104.html\">Paranal</a> Observatory in Chile.\n\nIntended\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2007/\nphot-36-07.html\">to illustrate</a> HAWK-I's impressive capabilities,\nthe tantalizing image highlights reddish young stars\nand protostars, likely up to a few million years old,\n<a href=\"ap050923.html\">emerging</a> from the\nnebular gas and dust.",
