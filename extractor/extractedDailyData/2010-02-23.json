  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created those rocket waves, and why did they destroy that sun dog?\n\nClose inspection of the\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/neurostar/4350258074/in/set-72157623288251657/\">above image</a> shows not only a rocket rising near the center, but unusual air ripples around it and a colorful sundog to the far right.\n\nThe rocket, carrying the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> (SDO), lifted off two weeks ago from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida\">Cape\nCanaveral</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida\">Florida</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> into a cold blue sky.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/about.php\">SDO</a> is designed to observe the Sun continuously over the next several years,\nexploring the\n<a href=\"ap050216.html\">Sun's atmosphere</a>\nat high resolution and fast time scales.\n\nThe air ripples -- seen about one minute after launch -- were unexpected,\nas was the sudden disappearance of the\n<a href=\"ap990823.html\">sundog</a> after the ripples passed.\n\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2010/18feb_coolmovie.htm\">Noticed</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwRfcrxFVEI\">recorded</a> by\n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/launch/watch.php\">several</a>  \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qvX9ZeSys8\">onlookers</a>, there has been much speculation about the origin of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsDEfu8s1Lw\">the ripples</a>.  \n\nAn ongoing discussion about them can be joined\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/discuss_apod.php?date=100223\">here</a> in APOD's discussion board\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/\">the Asterisk</a>.\n\nA leading hypothesis holds that the ripples resulted from a\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/barrier/boom/answer3.html\">sonic boom</a> created as the rocket broke the\n<a href=\"ap070819.html\">sound barrier</a>,\nwhich then jumbled a thin layer of\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/dogfm.htm\">ice crystals</a>\nthat were aligned to create the\n<a href=\"http://magnoliamanor-network.net/nicci/photogallery/sunning.jpg\">sundog</a>.\n\nLingering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Thinker_close.jpg\">questions</a> include why\n<a href=\"ap081001.html\">other rocket launches</a>\ndon't produce air ripples as noticeable,\nand why the ripples appeared more prominent above the rocket.\n\nIf you know of images of any other\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_history\">aircraft or\nspacecraft</a> that have produced similar air ripples, please post them to\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/discuss_apod.php?date=100223\">the discussion thread</a> -- they may be\nhelp create a better understanding of the effect.",
