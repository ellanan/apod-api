  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe odd looking \"creature\" to the right of center in the \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat071.html\">above photo</a> is a gas cloud known as a \n<a href=\"http://www.public.iastate.edu/~sdk/fick/april.html\">cometary globule</a>. \n\nThis globule, however, has ruptured. \n\nCometary <a href=\"ap020325.html\">globules</a> \nare typically characterized by \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dusty</a> heads and\nelongated <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...463L.105M\">tails</a>. \n\nThese features cause cometary \n<a href=\"ap020108.html\">globules</a> \nto have visual similarities to comets, \nbut in reality they are very much different. \n\n<a href=\"ap980921.html\">Globules</a> \nare frequently the birthplaces of stars, \nand many show very young stars in their heads.\n\nThe reason for the rupture in the head of this \nobject is not completely known. \n\nThe galaxy to the left of center is very far in\nthe distance and is only placed near \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995A%26A...293..493G\">CG4</a> by chance superposition.",
