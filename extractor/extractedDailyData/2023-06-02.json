  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBig, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/explore-the-night-sky-hubble-s-messier-catalog-bio\">Charles Messier's</a>\nfamous catalog, but definitely not\n<a href=\"https://www.messier.seds.org/m/m102d.html\">one</a> of the least.\n\nAbout 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost\ntwice the size of our own Milky Way.\n\nM101 was also one of the original\n<a href=\"https://www.messier.seds.org/more/m101_rosse.html\">spiral nebulae</a>\nobserved by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the\n<a href=\"https://birrcastle.com/telescope-astronomy/\">Leviathan</a>\nof Parsontown.\n\nAssembled from 51 exposures recorded by the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nin the 20th and 21st\ncenturies, with additional data from ground based telescopes,\nthis mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region\nof M101 in one of the highest definition\nspiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2006/10/1865-Image.html\">The sharp image shows stunning features</a>\nof the galaxy's face-on disk of stars and dust along with\nbackground galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself.\n\nAlso known as the\n<a href=\"https://www.messier.seds.org/m/m101.html\">Pinwheel Galaxy, M101</a>\nlies within the boundaries of the northern constellation\n<a href=\"ap160123.html\">Ursa Major</a>, about 25 million light-years away.",
