  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow far can you see from your own backyard?  \nAcross the Solar System, even across our Galaxy, \nthese sights are not difficult. \n\nRecently, however, amateur Paul Boltwood \ngazed across the universe. \nHis record setting image is shown <a href=\"http://ottawa.rasc.ca/pictures/pboltwood/deep_field/challenge.html\">above</a> in false color.  \n\nBoltwood imaged sources more faint than <a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 24 in response to a challenge made to \namateur astronomers by \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.yale.edu/index.html\">Yale Astronomy</a> Professor Bradley Schaefer.  \n\nObjects this dim tend to be \n<a href=\"ap980324.html\">galaxies</a> billions of light years away.  \n\nAlthough professionals have \n<a href=\"ap981214.html\">recently</a> recovered objects \nas dim as magnitude 30, Boltwood's image rivals even the \nbest professional efforts of only a few decades ago.  \n\nSince then, photon-catching \n<a href=\"http://www.phys.lsu.edu/observatory/ccdcamera.html\">Charge Coupled Devices</a> (CCDs) have allowed \n<a href=\"http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfp/classes/480/labman/lab_ccdi.htm\">high efficiency</a> frames to be added together.  \n\nAs evidence, <a href=\"http://www.conveyor.com/rasc/pictures/pboltwood/16inch.html\">Boltwood used</a> only a 16-inch telescope, \nbut co-added 767 exposures each lasting only two minutes.",
