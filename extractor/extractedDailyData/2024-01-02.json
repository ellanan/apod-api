  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan a rocket make the Moon ripple?\n\nNo, but it can make a background moon appear \n<a href=\"ap110824.html\">wavy</a>. \n\nThe rocket, in this case, was a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX\">SpaceX</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-heavy/\">Falcon Heavy</a> that blasted off from \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/kennedy/\">Kennedy Space Center</a> last week.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C1axBjiML5G/\">featured launch picture</a>, \nthe rocket's exhaust plume glows beyond its projection \nonto the distant, rising, and nearly full moon. \n\nOddly, the Moon's lower edge shows \n<a href=\"ap220531.html\">unusual drip-like ripples</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon itself</a>, \nfar in the distance, was really unchanged. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2016/05/19/why-do-we-see-waves-hot-objects/84598570/\">physical cause</a> of these \n<a href=\"ap221014.html\">apparent ripples</a> \nwas pockets of relatively hot or rarefied air \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-causes-a-mirage/\">deflecting moonlight</a> less strongly than \npockets of relatively cool or compressed air: \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/m9cUy6B--xc\">refraction</a>.\n\nAlthough the <a href=\"https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/05/71/90/95/1000_F_571909511_2H2RjYDbjosmoIBPivtXCgf61mub22oS.jpg\">shot was planned</a>, the timing of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yWUU1PqX6Og?t=50\">the launch</a> \nhad to be just right for the rocket to be \n<a href=\"ap201106.html\">transiting the Moon</a> during this single exposure.",
