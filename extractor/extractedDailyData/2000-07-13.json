  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe tiny spot circled on the right actually represents a big\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/00_releases/\npress_071100.html\">astronomical discovery</a> -- the first detected\nflare from a failed star.\n\nFailed stars, termed\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nbrowndwarf_fg.html\">brown dwarfs</a> in astronomers'\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/background-text/\nbrdwarfs.txt\">parlance</a>,\nare too low in mass to ignite nuclear hydrogen burning in their cores,\nyet still shine feebly as the energy from\ntheir gravitational collapse is converted to heat and light.\n\nIn fact, the\n<a href=\"http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/97articles/\nmartin.html\">dim brown dwarf</a> cataloged as LP944-20 is\nestimated to have only\n6 percent the mass of the Sun (60 times the mass of Jupiter) and\none-tenth the Sun's diameter.\n\nA mere 16 light-years distant in the southern constellation Fornax\nit is <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1997/\npr-07-97.html\">well studied</a>,\nbut this failed star recently\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0005559\">startled astronomers</a>\nby producing a\nflare visible at\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory1_xray.html\">x-ray energies</a>.\n\nThe above\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>\nimages of the <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/1054/\nlp94420_hand.html\">LP944-20</a> star field were\nrecorded in December 1999.\n\nShowing nothing (left) for the first  \nnine hours, the brown dwarf generated a significant x-ray flare during the\nfinal hours of the observation.\n\nHow did a failed star produced such a\n<a href=\"ap000608.html\">high-energy flare</a>?\n\nMagnetic fields twisted and broken by turbulent motions near the surface\nof the brown dwarf may be the culprit.\n\n<a href=\"ap990324.html\">Difficult</a> to detect\nbecause they are otherwise faint, brown dwarf stars\nare believed to be <a href=\"http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/97articles/\nmhowmany.html\">common</a> throughout the galaxy.",
