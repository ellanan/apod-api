  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe surface of the Sun is shifting.  By watching \n<a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/sunspots.html\">sunspots</a>, it has long been known that our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> \nrotates.  It was also known that the center of the \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/sun.htm\">Sun</a> \nrotates faster than the poles.  Now, recent measurements by the \n<a href=\" http://soi.stanford.edu/\">Solar Oscillations \nInvestigations</a> group of the \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/english/\">SOHO Observatory</a> have found that the \nsurface of the sun moves in other ways, too.  \nHot, electrically charged gas flows along and beneath the \nSun's surface as depicted in the \n<a href=\"http://quake.stanford.edu/~phil/PR/caption2.html\">above computer generated diagram</a>.  The speed of these \n<a href=\"http://quake.stanford.edu/~phil/PR/ssu.html\">solar rivers</a> \nis false-color coded with red \n<a href=\"http://mwanal.lanl.gov/julie/imagemap/periodic/1.html\">hydrogen</a> moving faster than blue.  Over the course of a year <a href=\"http://lasagna.colorado.edu/ExploringSpace/PlasmaStateOfMatter/1.html\">plasma</a> moves from the equator to the poles, \nwhile internal eddies circulate gas from deep inside the \n<a href=\"lib/sun.html\">Sun</a>.  \nOne surprise is the similarity to the motion of air in the \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> - indicating that scientists might learn \nmore about \n<a href=\" http://www.earthisland.org/ei/journal/weather.html\">Earth's global weather</a> by studying the \n<a href=\"ap970226.html\">Sun</a>.",
