  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt is everywhere but nobody knew why.  \n\nIn every direction at all times, the \n<a href=\"ap961008.html\">sky glows</a> in \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/961028a.html\">X-rays</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/background.html\">X-ray background</a> phenomenon was discovered over 35 years ago, \nsoon after the first \n<a href=\"ap980524.html\">X-ray satellites</a> were launched, \nand has since gone unexplained.  \n\nYesterday \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/00_releases/press_011400bg.html\">results were released</a> using data from the recently launched \n<a href=\"ap990727.html\">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a> \nthat appears to have resolved much of this mystery.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/news/photos/2000/photos00-010.htm\">above photograph</a> shows that about 80 percent of the apparently diffuse \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9812134\">hard X-ray background</a> \ncan be resolved into very many very faint sources.  \n\nThe new question is now what are these sources?  \nEarly speculation, much of which \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999MNRAS.305L...1D\">predates these observations</a>, holds that many of these sources are the \n<a href=\"ap991107.html\">active centers</a> of \n<a href=\"ap980607.html\">distant galaxies</a>, \nprobably involving \n<a href=\"ap971206.html\">massive black holes</a>.  \nStill other sources may be of origins currently unknown.",
