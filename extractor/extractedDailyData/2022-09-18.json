  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you went outside at the same time every day and \ntook a picture that included the Sun, how would the Sun's position change? \n\nA more visual answer to that question is an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma\">analemma</a>, \na composite image taken from the same spot at the \nsame time over the course of a year. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://gmrphotographer.net/wordpress/2019/01/29/2017-solar-analemma-over-callanish/\">featured analemma</a> was composed from images \ntaken every few days at noon near the village of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish\">Callanish</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides\">Outer Hebrides</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland\">Scotland</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom\">UK</a>. \n\nIn the foreground are the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones\">Callanish</a> \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/5mcPHxuVhWk\">Stones</a>, \na stone circle built around 2700 BC during humanity's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age\">Bronze Age</a>. \n\nIt is not known if the placement of the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkbEhp8hJN8\">Callanish Stones</a> has or had astronomical significance. \n\nThe ultimate causes for the \n<a href=\"ap160822.html\">figure-8</a> shape of this and all analemmas are the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/\">tilt of the Earth axis</a> \nand the \n<a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ellipse.html\">ellipticity</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://bhenvis.nic.in/images/season_climate.jpg\">Earth's orbit</a> \naround the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/exploration/\">Sun</a>. \n\nAt the <a href=\"ap170621.html\">solstice</a>s, \nthe Sun will appear at the top or bottom of an analemma.\n\nThe featured image was taken near the December solstice and so the Sun appears near the bottom. \n\n<a href=\"ap170319.html\">Equinox</a>es, however, \ncorrespond to analemma middle points -- not the intersection point.\n\nThis coming Friday at 1:04 am \n(<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/TimeZone.html\">UT</a>) \n-- Thursday in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas\">Americas</a> -- \nis the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">equinox</a> (\"equal night\"), \nwhen day and night are equal over all of planet Earth.\n\nMany \n<a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/59049/autumnal-equinox-traditions\">cultures celebrate</a> a change of season at an \n<a href=\"ap160320.html\">equinox</a>.",
