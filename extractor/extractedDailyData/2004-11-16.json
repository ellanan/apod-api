  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow old is this galaxy?  \n\nThe nearby \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/local.html\">Local Group</a> \ngalaxy dubbed the \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/31/supplemental.html\">Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy</a> (SagDIG) \nis not only very small but also has relatively few elements more massive than \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/2.html\">helium</a>.  \n\nNow the lack of heavy elements might mean that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002A%26A...384..393M\">SagDIG</a> is very young, so that component stars \nhad little time to create and disperse massive elements.  \n\nConversely, \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/LG/sagdig.html\">SagDIG</a>'s diminutive size could indicate that it formed in the early universe, being a surviving \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/sagdeg.html\">building block</a> of modern \n<a href=\"ap040718.html\">large galaxies</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/31/index.html\">above detailed image</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nhas now resolved enough stars to \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/31/supplemental.html\">solve this mystery</a>: SagDIG is ancient.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/31/fast_facts.html\">SagDIG</a> does have some groups of young stars, many stars are very old, \nand the galaxy as a whole helps astronomers to understand how the \n<a href=\"ap990905.html\">universe evolved</a>, and show that at least one \n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20030818.metalpoor.html\">metal-poor</a> galaxy is almost as \n<a href=\"ap031231.html\">old</a> as the universe.  \n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/31/caption.html\">Pictured above</a>, \nSagDIG spans about 1,500 <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> and lies about 3.5 million light years away toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"ap011229.html\">Sagittarius</a>.",
