  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNot all evolving stars eject gas clouds that look like people.  \n\nOH231.8+4.2 was a star much like our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> that ran out of nuclear fuel to \n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/\">fuse</a> in its core.  \n\nIt has therefore entered the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebula</a> phase, where it throws off \nits outer atmosphere into space leaving a core that will become a \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf star</a>.  \nEvery Sun-like star creates a different planetary nebula though, \nand <a href=\" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997A%26A...324..237W\">OH231.8+4.2</a>'s looks eerily like a person!  \n\nSpectacular \n<a href=\"ap971124.html\">jets</a> of streaming gas can be seen in \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/39/index.html\">this recently released photograph</a> by the Hubble Space Telescope.  The gas cloud has been dubbed the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/39/pr-photos.html\">Rotten Egg Planetary Nebula</a> because it contains \nunusually high amounts of \n<a href=\"http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/S.html\">sulfur</a>, an element that, when combined with other\nelements, can smell like a rotten egg.  \n\nThis young \n<a href=\"ap971223.html\">planetary nebula</a> \nwill likely change its appearance over the \nnext few thousand years and eventually disperse.",
