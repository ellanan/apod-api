  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it be like to see a sunset on Mars?  \n\nTo help find out, the <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040104a.html\">robotic rover Spirit</a> was deployed in 2005 \nto park and watch the Sun dip serenely below the distant lip of \n<a href=\"ap020627.html\">Gusev crater</a>.  \n\nColors in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07997\">above image</a> have been slightly exaggerated but\nwould likely be apparent to a human\n<a href=\"ap080629.html\">explorer's eye</a>.\n\nFine martian dust particles suspended in the thin atmosphere\n<a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/14C.html\">lend\nthe sky</a> a reddish color,\nbut the dust also scatters blue light in the forward direction,\ncreating a \n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">bluish sky</a> glow near the setting Sun.\n\nBecause Mars is farther away, the Sun is less bright and\nonly about two thirds the diameter it appears from Earth.\n\nImages like this help atmospheric scientists understand not only the \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Mars/atmosphere.html\">atmosphere of Mars</a>, but atmospheres across the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>, \nincluding our \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">home Earth</a>.",
