  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does asteroid 2015 BZ509 orbit the Sun the backwards?\n\nAs shown in the featured animation, Jupiter's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(astronomy)\">trojan asteroids</a> orbit the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> in two major groups -- one just ahead of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/in-depth/\">Jupiter</a>, and one just behind -- but all orbit the \n<a href=\"ap180204.html\">Sun</a> in the same direction as Jupiter. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(514107)_2015_BZ509\">Asteroid BZ509</a> however, discovered in 2015 and currently unnamed, \norbits the Sun in retrograde and in a more complex gravitational dance with \n<a href=\"ap180226.html\">Jupiter</a>.\n\nThe reason why is currently unknown and a topic of research -- \nbut if resolved might tell us about the early \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a>. \n\nA <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180509013N\">recently popular hypothesis</a> holds that \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uwo.ca/~wiegert/2015BZ509/\">BZ509</a> \nwas captured by Jupiter  \n<a href=\"ap171122.html\">from interstellar space</a> billions of years ago, \nwhile a competing conjecture posits that BZ509 came from our Solar System's own \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/bosf/docs/01_09%20Capture%20and%20orbit%20of%20a%20comet%201280x720.png\">distant Oort cloud</a> of comets, perhaps more recently.\n\nThe answer may only become known after more detailed models of the likelihood and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point\">stability of orbits</a> near Jupiter are \n<a href=\"https://d32xvgr96w2oxp.cloudfront.net/2013/06/media-image-346120-article-ajust_930.jpg\">studied</a>, or, possibly, by observing direct properties of the unusual object.",
