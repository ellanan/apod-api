  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to circle a black hole?\n\nIf the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes\">black hole</a> was surrounded by a \n<a href=\"ap190820.html\">swirling disk of glowing and accreting gas</a>, \nthen the great gravity of the black hole would \n<a href=\"https://www.phy.mtu.edu/bht/rjn_bht.html\">deflect light</a> \nemitted by the disk to make it look very unusual.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13326\">featured animated video</a> gives a visualization.\n\nThe video starts with you, the observer, looking toward the \n<a href=\"ap200324.html\">black hole</a> from just above the plane of the accretion disk. \n\nSurrounding the central \n<a href=\"https://jila.colorado.edu/hamilton/black-holes/journey-schwarzschild-black-hole\">black hole</a> is a thin circular image of the orbiting disk that marks the position of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere\">photon sphere</a> -- \ninside of which lies the black hole's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon\">event horizon</a>. \n\nToward the left, parts of the large main image of the disk \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_(astronomy)\">appear brighter</a> \nas they move toward you.\n\nAs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l36UkYtq6m0\">the video</a> \ncontinues, you loop over the \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N/abstract\">black hole</a>, soon looking down from the top, \nthen passing through the disk plane on the far side, \nthen returning to your \n<a href=\"image/2008/BhAccretionDisk_NasaSchnittman_3851_annotated.jpg\">original vantage point</a>.\n\nThe accretion disk does some interesting \n<a href=\"ap141026.html\">image inversions</a> -- but never appears flat.\n\nVisualizations such as this are particularly relevant today as \n<a href=\"ap190411.html\">black holes are being imaged</a> \nin unprecedented detail by the \n<a href=\"https://eventhorizontelescope.org/\">Event Horizon Telescope</a>.",
