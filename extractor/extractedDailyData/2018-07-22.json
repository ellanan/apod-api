  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is our universe made of?\n\nTo help find out, ESA launched the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_satellite\">Planck satellite</a> from 2009 to 2013 to map, in unprecedented detail, slight temperature differences on the \n<a href=\"ap001029.html\">oldest optical surface</a> known -- \nthe background sky when our universe first \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_%28cosmology%29\">became transparent</a> to light.\n\nVisible in all directions, this \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CMB.html\">cosmic microwave background</a> \nis a complex tapestry that could only show the \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA16873\">hot and cold patterns</a> observed were the universe to be composed of specific \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N\">types of energy</a> \nthat evolved in specific ways.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209\">The final results</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck\">reported last week</a>, \nconfirm again that most of our universe \nis mostly composed of mysterious and unfamiliar \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy\">dark energy</a>, and that even most of the remaining matter energy is \n<a href=\"ap111003.html\">strangely dark</a>.\n\nAdditionally, the \"final\" 2018 Planck data \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/planck/60499-from-an-almost-perfect-universe-to-the-best-of-both-worlds/\">impressively peg</a> \nthe age of the universe at about 13.8 billion years and the local  \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_expansion.html\">expansion rate</a> -- called the Hubble constant -- at 67.4 (+/- 0.5) km/sec/Mpc.\n\nOddly, this early-universe determined \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law\">Hubble constant</a> \nis slightly lower than \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...861..126R\">that determined by other methods in the late-universe</a>, \ncreating a <a href=\"https://www.barkbusters.co.uk/images/articles/7a4120f095480e9f2a2ad2a165d90313.jpg\">tension</a> that is causing much \n<a href=\"https://astrobites.org/2017/10/13/the-hubble-constants/\">discussion</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/01/03/scientists-still-dont-know-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding/\">speculation</a>.",
