  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy doesn't the nearby galaxy create a \n<a href=\"https://www.science.org.au/curious/space-time/gravitational-lensing\">gravitational lensing</a> effect on the background galaxy?\n\nIt does, but since both \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/galaxy/en/\">galaxies</a> \nare so nearby, the angular shift is much smaller than the <a href=\"https://lonewolfonline.net/angular-size/\">angular size</a>s \nof the galaxies themselves. \n\nThe featured \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-history-timeline\">Hubble</a> image of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3314\">NGC 3314</a> \nshows two large spiral galaxies which happen to \n<a href=\"https://i.redd.it/18w9o6xdiip21.jpg\">line up</a> exactly. \n\nThe foreground spiral \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....122.1369K/abstract\">NGC 3314a</a> appears nearly face-on with its \n<a href=\"ap150614.html\">pinwheel shape</a> defined by young bright star clusters. \n\nAgainst the glow of the background galaxy NGC 3314b, though, dark swirling lanes of \n<a href=\"https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/interstellardust.cfm\">interstellar dust</a> can also be seen tracing the nearer spiral's structure. \n\nBoth galaxies appear on the edge of the \n<a href=\"ap120512.html\">Hydra Cluster of Galaxies</a>, \na cluster that is about 200 million light years away.\n\n<a href=\"ap210823.html\">Gravitational lens distortions</a> \nare much easier to see when the \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/2peq2b/hey_guys_this_is_ngc_3314_according_to_nasa_this/\">lensing galaxy</a> is smaller and further away.\n\nThen, the background galaxy may even be distorted into a \n<a href=\"ap111221.html\">ring</a> around the nearer.\n\nFast gravitational lens flashes due to stars in the foreground galaxy \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003hst..prop.9977B/abstract\">momentarily magnifying</a> the light from stars in the background galaxy might one day be visible in future observing campaigns with high-resolution telescopes.",
