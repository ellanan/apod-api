  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs the <a href=\"http://www.mos.org/kili/\">Roof of Africa</a> on fire?  \n\nA group hiking at 6 am near the top of \n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/img_kilimanjaro.html\">Mt. Kilimanjaro</a> watched the rising sun peak above the clouds and\nthe horizon light up red. \n\nDon't worry -- in this case the highest volcano in <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/reference_maps/africa.html\">Africa</a> is not even erupting.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap031021.html\">spectacular sunrise</a> \ncolors are caused by light scattering off the \natmosphere and small cloud particles.  \n\nIf all of the scattered light that makes the \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html\">sky blue</a> were added back into the scene,\nthe sunrise would appear Sun-colored and not so red.  \n\nA similar light scattering effect involving small airborne \ndust particles causes \n<a href=\"ap050620.html\">sunsets on Mars</a> to be red \nand has been used to determine the sizes of particles in the \n<a href=\"ap050525.html\">rings of Saturn</a>.  \n\nDuring this trek in 2000 November, a group of about 30 reached the \n<a href=\"ap040911.html\">Kilomanjaro</a> \n<a href=\"ap050306.html\">summit</a> after a six-day climb.",
