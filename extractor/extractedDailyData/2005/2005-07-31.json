  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs that a tenth planet?  \n\nA faint, slowly moving dot \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~pick/survey.html\">discovered by computer</a> shows clear signs of being a deep \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> \nobject at least as large as \n<a href=\"ap010319.html\">Pluto</a>.  \n\nThe object, designated 2003 UB<sub>313</sub>, is currently \nsituated nearly 100 times the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit\">Earth-Sun distance</a> -- over twice the \naverage Pluto-Sun distance.  \n\nThat far out, the only way a single round object \ncould be as bright as 2003 UB<sub>313</sub> would be if \nit is at least as large as Pluto and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo\">completely reflective</a>.  \n\nSince 2003 UB<sub>313</sub> is surely \n<a href=\"http://gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=142\">not completely reflective</a>, it could be substantially larger.  \n\nOne of the <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2005-126\">discovery frames</a> is shown above digitally expanded and \nartificially brightened. \n\n2003 UB<sub>313</sub> was \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~pick/survey.html\">identified</a> initially on frames taken by the automated 1.2-meter \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomarnew/sot.html\">Samuel Oschin Telescope</a> at \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/\">Palomar Observatory in \n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.",
