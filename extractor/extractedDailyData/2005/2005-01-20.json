  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over the water?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/historic/nws/wea00308.htm\">Pictured above</a> is one of the better images yet recorded of a \n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wspouts.htm\">waterspout</a>, \na type of tornado that occurs over water.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/science/spouts/waterspouts.htm\">Waterspouts</a> are spinning columns of rising moist air that \ntypically form over warm water.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/weather/tornado/wtspouts.htm\">Waterspouts</a> can be as dangerous as \n<a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/tornadoes.html\">tornadoes</a> \nand can feature wind speeds over 200 kilometers per hour.  \n\nMany waterspouts form away from \n<a href=\"http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/trw.htm\">thunderstorms</a> and even during relatively fair weather.  \n\nWaterspouts may be relatively transparent and initially \nvisible only by the unusual pattern they create on the water.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/historic/nws/wea00308.htm\">above image</a> was taken in 1969 from an aircraft off the \n<a href=\"http://www.florida-keys.fl.us/maps/mainmap.htm\">Florida Keys</a>, a location arguably the hottest spot for \n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wspwhere.htm\">waterspouts</a> \nin the world with hundreds forming each year.  \n\nSome people \n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wspouts.htm\">speculate</a> that these waterspouts are responsible for many of the losses recorded in the \n<a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm\">Bermuda Triangle</a>\nregion of the \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zh.html\">Atlantic Ocean</a>.",
