  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat does our Milky Way Galaxy look like from afar?  \n\nSince we are stuck inside, and since opaque \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> truncates our view in \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">visible light</a>, nobody knows for sure.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space-art.co.uk/html/galaxies/fgalaxies2.html?milkyway\">Drawn above</a>, however, is a good guess based on many different types of observations.  \n\nIn the <a href=\"ap041107.html\">Milky Way's center</a> \nis a very bright core region centered on a \n<a href=\"ap021018.html\">large black hole</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://cassfos02.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way</a>'s bright \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way\">central bulge</a> \nis now thought to be an \n<a href=\"ap030413.html\">asymmetrical bar</a> \nof relatively old and red stars.  \n\nThe outer regions are where the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q2233.html\">spiral arms</a> \nare found, dominated in appearance by \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open clusters</a> \nof young, bright, blue stars, by red \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebula</a>, and by dark dust.  \n\nThe spiral arms reside in a disk dominated in mass by relatively dim stars and \n<a href=\"ap010113.html\">loose gas</a> composed mostly of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\">hydrogen</a>.  \n\nWhat is not depicted is a huge spherical halo of invisible \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter.html\">dark matter</a> that dominates the mass of the \n<a href=\"ap000130.html\">Milky Way</a> \nas well as the motions of stars away from the center.",
