  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNear its northernmost declination,\n<a href=\"http://users.aol.com/JEBrown800/PressReleases/\nHighestMoons120905.html\">tonight's Full Moon</a> will\nbe a special one,\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/\narticle_1637_1.asp\">arcing high</a> in northern hemisphere skies.\n\nBut a <a href=\"http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/\nmoon_phases.html\">Full Moon</a> won't occur on this\ncalendar date for another 19 years, a period known as the\n<a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/\nLunarCycles.html\">lunar Metonic cycle</a>.\n\nSeptember 15th's lunar phase and date were notable too,\nmarking the return of a gibbous Moon rising over\nthe High Sierra mountains.\n\nThat scene was captured in\n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4848982\">Ansel\nAdams' famous</a>\nphotograph Autumn Moon from Glacier Point,\n<a href=\"http://www.yosemite.org/vryos/index.htm\">Yosemite</a> National Park.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2005/september/\n091605.htm\">Earlier this year</a>,\nTexas State University physicists Donald Olson,\nRussell Doescher and students were able to pinpoint the location\nand (formerly uncertain) date the original\n<a href=\"http://www.geh.org/taschen/htmlsrc15/\nindex.html#72:0065:0020\">Ansel Adams</a> photo was\ntaken - September 15, 1948.\n\nAccordingly, their astronomical detective work predicted that\nthe lunar alignment and waxing gibbous phase would be repeated on\nThursday, September 15, 2005, exactly three 19-year Metonic\ncycles later.\n\nOn that day, about 300 photographers gathered at Glacier Point to record\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1595_1.asp\">Ansel\nAdams' Autumn Moon encore</a>.",
