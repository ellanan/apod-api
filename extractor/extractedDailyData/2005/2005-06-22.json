  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat do Saturn's rings look like from the other side?  \n\nFrom Earth, we usually see Saturn's rings from the same side \nof the ring plane that the Sun illuminates them.\n\nGeometrically, in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07520\">above picture</a> taken in April by the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/saturn/cassini_tour.html\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>, \nthe Sun is behind the camera but on the \n<i>other side</i> of the ring plane. \n\nSuch a vantage point gives a \n<a href=\"ap050211.html\">breathtaking view</a>s of the most \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html\">splendid ring system</a> in the Solar System.\n\nStrangely, the rings have similarities to a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)\">photographic negative</a> of a front view.\n\nFor example, the dark band in the middle is actually the \n<a href=\"ap040723.html\">normally bright B-ring</a>.\n\nThe ring brightness as recorded from different angles \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001DPS....33.2901P\">indicates</a> ring thickness and particle density of ring particles. \n\nImages like these are also interesting for what they \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005AGUSM.P21C..07M\">do not show: spokes</a>.  \n\nThe unexpected shadowy regions once recorded by the \n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Voyager missions</a> when they \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vgrsat.htm\">passed Saturn</a> in the early 1980s are not, so far, being seen by Cassini.  \n\nExtra credit: Can you \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07520\">spot the small moon</a> (Prometheus) among the rings?",
