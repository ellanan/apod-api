  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDazzling in\n<a href=\"http://www.uvaa.org/BinocularResources.htm\">binoculars</a>\nor a small telescope, the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html\">Moon</a> is\npocked with impact craters.\n\nDuring partial\n<a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/6389/Da_Moon.htm\">lunar\nphases</a>, the craters along the terminator\nare cast in dramatic relief by strong shadows.\n\nBut when the \n<a href=\"moon.html\">Moon</a> is full some \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">craters</a> seem to sprout systems\nof bright radial lines or rays.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.galaxyimages.com/copernicus.html\">This detailed</a>\nclose-up of the full Moon features two\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/orbiter/\norbiter-craters.html\">prominent ray craters</a>,\nCopernicus (upper left) and Tycho (lower right), \neach with extensive ray systems of light colored debris blasted out\nby the <a href=\"ap050203.html\">crater-forming</a> impacts.\n\nIn general, ray craters are relatively young as their rays overlay\nthe <a href=\"ap001209.html\">lunar terrain</a>.\n\nIn fact, at 85 kilometers wide, Tycho, with its far reaching rays,\nis the youngest large crater on the nearside.\n\n<a href=\"ap010513.html\">Crater Copernicus</a>, \nsurrounded by dark mare which contrast\nnicely with its bright rays, is 93 kilometers in diameter.",
