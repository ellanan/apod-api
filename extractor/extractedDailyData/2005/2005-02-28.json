  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those unusual plates on Mars?  \n\nA <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005LPI....36.1741M\">leading current interpretation</a> holds that they are \nblocks of ice floating on a recently frozen sea covered by dust.  \n\nThe unusual plates were photographed recently by the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">European Space Agency</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMFU55V9ED_0.html\">Mars Express</a> spacecraft currently orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>.  \n\nOddly, the region lies near the \n<a href=\"ap010628.html\">Martian equator</a> \nand not near either of Mars' \n<a href=\"ap021224.html\">frozen polar caps</a>.  \n\nWithout being covered by <a href=\"ap970804.html\">dust</a>, any water or ice near away from the poles would quickly \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/sublimation.html\">evaporate</a> right into the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/mars/atmosphere.html\">atmosphere</a>.  \n\nEvidence that the <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMCHPYEM4E_1.html\">above-imaged</a> plates really are dust-covered \nwater-ice includes a similarity in appearance to \n<a href=\"ap050223.html\">ice blocks off Earth's Antarctica</a>, \nnearby surface fractures from which underground water could have flowed, \nand the shallow depth of the \n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/craters/\">craters</a> indicating that something is filling them in.  \n\nIf correct, the low abundance of craters indicates \nthat water may have flowed on \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Mars</a> \nas recently as five million years ago.",
