  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDoes the Sun always rise in the same direction?  \n\nNo.  As the seasons change, the direction toward the rising Sun will change, too.  \n\nThe Sun will always \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/antwoorden/zonpositie.html\">rise and set furthest</a> to the south during the day of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice\">Winter Solstice</a>, \nand furthest to the north during Summer Solstice.  \n\nToday is <a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/WinterSolstice.html\">Winter Solstice</a>, the day of least sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere \nand of most sunlight in the <a href=\"ap021222.html\">Southern Hemisphere</a>.  \n\nIn many countries, the Winter Solstice brings a \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/badseasons.html\">change in season</a>, as it is the \n<a href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_170b.html\">first day</a> of winter in the North.    \n\nThe solar heating and stored energy in the Earth's surface and \natmosphere is near its lowest during \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter\">winter</a>, \nmaking it usually the coldest months of the year.  \n\nOn the brighter side in the north, daylight hours will increase \nevery day from now until June.  \n\nPictured above are the \n<a href=\"ap040621.html\">different directions</a> \nof the rising sun throughout the year above a small town in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>.",
