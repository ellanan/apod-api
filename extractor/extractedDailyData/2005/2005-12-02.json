  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first object on\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/biograph.html\">Charles\nMessier's</a> famous list of things which are not comets.\n\nIn fact, the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m001_rosse.html\">cosmic Crab</a>\nis now known to be a\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/\nsupernova_remnants.html\">supernova remnant</a>,\nan expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nLight from that stellar catastrophe was first\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m001_sn.html\">witnessed\nby astronomers</a> on planet Earth in the year 1054.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skyfactory.org/hst/crab/crab.htm\">Composed of 24\nexposures</a> taken in October 1999, January 2000,\nand December 2000, this\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n2005/37/\">Hubble Space Telescope mosaic</a> spans about twelve light years.\n\nColors in the intricate filaments trace the light emitted from atoms\nof hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur in the debris cloud.\n\nThe spooky blue interior glow is emitted by high-energy electrons\naccelerated by the\n<a href=\"ap000605.html\">Crab's central</a> pulsar.\n\nOne of the most exotic objects known to modern astronomers,\n<a href=\"ap050326.html\">the pulsar is</a>\na neutron star, the spinning remnant of the\ncollapsed stellar core.\n\nThe Crab Nebula lies about 6,500 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/taurus/\">constellation\nTaurus</a>.",
