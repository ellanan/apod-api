  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would a small part of the Sun appear slightly dark?\n\nVisible above is a close-up picture of a \n<a href=\"ap980322.html\">sunspot</a>, a depression on the Sun's face that is slightly cooler and less luminous than the rest of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a>.  \n\nThe Sun's complex \n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/Magnetic/what.html\">magnetic field</a> creates this cool region by inhibiting hot material from entering the \n<a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/SOLAR/SSN/ssn.html\">spot</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://solar-center.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/quiz2.pl/sunspot_quiz.html\">Sunspots</a> can be <a href=\"ap031027.html\">larger than the Earth</a> \nand typically last for only a few days.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/9808image.html\">This high-resolution picture</a> also shows clearly that the \nSun's face is a bubbling sea of separate cells of \n<a href=\"ap041010.html\">hot gas</a>.  \n\nThese cells are known as <a href=\"\nhttp://solar-center.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/quiz2.pl/granule_quiz.html\">granules</a>.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_%28solar_physics%29\">solar granule</a> is about 1000 \nkilometers across and lasts about 10 minutes.  After that, many \n<a href=\"ap970108.html\">granules</a> end up exploding.",
