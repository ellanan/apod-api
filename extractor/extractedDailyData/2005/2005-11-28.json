  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is the geologic history of Mars?  \n\nTo help find out, the \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/mars-rover6.htm\">robot Spirit rover</a> \nexplored the terrain on the way up to the top of Husband Hill and took pictures along the way.  \n\nEarth-bound team members later combined images from one camera with \ncolors from another to create <a href=\"http://www.aviationweek.com/avnow/news/channel_awst_story.jsp?id=news/11145p1.xml\">this semi-realistic vista</a> from near the top of the rugged hill.   \n\nMany rock faces were imaged and probed along the way.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.aviationweek.com/avnow/news/channel_awst_story.jsp?id=news/11145p1.xml\">above image</a> captures not only a high and distant Mars inside \n<a href=\"ap020627.html\">Gusev crater</a>, \nbut also more of the <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/mars-rover3.htm\">refrigerator-sized Spirit rover</a>\nthan other \n<a href=\"ap050907.html\">similar</a> \n<a href=\"ap051114.html\">vistas</a>.  \n\nVisible technology includes a wide array of energy-absorbing \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panels\">solar panels</a>, a \n<a href=\"ap040110.html\">sundial</a>, and the \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/mars-rover6.htm\">circular \nhigh gain communications antenna</a>.",
