  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nScroll right to see a breathtaking panorama of \nMars from the top of Husband Hill.  \n\nThe image was taken by the robotic rover Spirit now exploring the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">red planet</a>.  \n\nSpirit, situated in expansive \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/30dec_gusevcrater.htm\">Gusev Crater</a>, has been exploring the \n<a href=\"ap040628.html\">Columbia Hills</a> \nfor some time including climbing \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_D._Husband\">Husband Hill</a> over the last few months.  \n\nOn the way up, Spirit took in a color vista from \n<a href=\"ap050517.html\">Larry's Lookout</a>.  \n\nVisible in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04181\">above image</a> is the vast eastern landscape \npreviously blocked from view by the Columbia Hills themselves.  \n\nThe horizon is mostly defined by the rim of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thira_%28crater%29\">Thira crater</a> visible some 15 kilometers in the distance.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_rover\">Spirit</a> \nwill now examine  <a href=\"ap050412.html\">rocks and soil</a> \nat the top of \n<a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20050207/mars.html\">Husband Hill</a>, looking for clues as to how the hills and \nlocal rocks formed in the \n<a href=\"ap040303.html\">distant past</a>.",
