  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill Mars appear extremely close and bright later this month?  \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/07jul_marshoax.htm\">No</a>.\n\nRegardless of numerous \n<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/science/mars.asp\">urban legends</a> circulating, Mars will appear relatively normal in August.  \n\nOctober is the best month to \n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">see Mars</a> this year.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">red planet</a> \nis now visible in the morning before sunrise.\n\nAs Earth catches up to \n<a href=\"ap050401.html\">Mars</a> \nin their respective orbits around the Sun, Mars will keep \n<a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/yawn.html\">rising earlier</a> in the night.\n\nOn 2005 October 30, Earth will have \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/27may_approachingmars.htm\">caught up to Mars</a> and the planets will \nbe the nearest to each other in their orbits -- this time around.  \n\nOn October 30, Mars will be \n<a href=\"http://www.earthsky.org/skywatching/tsky.php?t=20050805\">nearly opposite</a> to the Sun, rise at sunset, set at sunrise, \nand appear highest and brightest around midnight. \n\nAlso on October 30, Mars will \n<a href=\"http://www.earthsky.com/skywatching/marsbrightest.php\">appear brighter</a> than it has in the past two years, \nalthough still over 10,000 times smaller and fainter than the full Moon.  \n\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a> will then pass Mars, \nand Mars will appear to fade.\n\n<a href=\"http://astropics.com/vfire2/3323.htm\">Pictured above</a>, \nMars is shown as it appeared 2003 August 27, when it \n<a href=\"ap030828.html\">appeared slightly brighter</a> \nthan it had in nearly 60,000 years.   \n\nThe foreground setting is in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Fire\">Valley of Fire</a> state park in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada\">Nevada</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipticity\">ellipticity</a> of orbits primarily determines the closeness \nand brightness of Mars during \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/headline_universe/solar_system/stories_2003/mars_opposit_27aug2003.html\">opposition</a>.",
