  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nEach moon of Saturn seems to come with its own \n<a href=\"ap050201.html\">mystery</a>.  \n\nRhea, Saturn's second largest moon behind \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?titan\">Titan</a>, shows unusual wisps, visible above as light colored streaks.  \n\nHigher resolution images of similar wisps on Dione indicate that they\nmight be made of long braided fractures. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/rhea.html\">Rhea</a> is composed mostly of \n<a href=\"http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2005/statues.html\">water ice</a>, \nbut likely has a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003PEPI..136..201A\">small rocky core</a>. \n\nRhea's rotation and orbit are locked together, just like \n<a href=\"ap040829.html\">Earth's Moon</a>, so that one \nside always faces <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_%28planet%29\">Saturn</a>. \n\nA consequence of this is that one side always leads the other. \n\n<a href=\"ap030608.html\">Rhea</a>'s leading surface is much more heavily \n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">cratered</a> than the trailing surface, pictured above.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06578\">above image</a> in natural color was taken last month by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">Cassini robot spacecraft</a> in orbit around Saturn.",
