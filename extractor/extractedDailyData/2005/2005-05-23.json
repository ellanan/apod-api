  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes small waves in Saturn's rings?  \n\nObservations of rings bordering the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeler_gap\">Keeler gap</a> in \n<a href=\"http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html\">Saturn's rings</a> showed unusual waves.  \n\nSuch waves were first noticed last July and are \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06239\">shown above</a> in clear detail.\n\nThe picture is a digitally foreshortened \nimage mosaic taken earlier this month by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nThe rings, made of many \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html\">small particles</a>, were somehow not orbiting Saturn in their usual manner.\n\nClose inspection of the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06238\">image shows</a> the reason - a small moon is orbiting in the Keeler gap.  \n\nThe previously unknown moon is estimated \nto span about seven kilometers and appears to have the same \n<a href=\"ap040723.html\">brightness</a> as nearby ring particles.   \n\nThe <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtongrav.html\">gravity</a> of the small moon likely perturbs the orbits of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005DDA....36.0301B\">ring particles</a> that come near it, \ncausing them to shimmy back and forth after the moon passes.  \n\nSince inner particles orbit more quickly than outer particles, \nonly the leading particles of the inner rings and the \ntrailing particles of the outer rings show the wave effect.",
