  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy did the Boomerang Nebula form?    \n\nThe symmetric cloud dubbed the \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2005/25/caption.html\">Boomerang</a> appears to have been created by a high-speed \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">wind</a> of gas and dust blowing from an aging central star at \nspeeds of nearly 600,000 kilometers per hour.  \n\nWhat confines the wind remains a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997ApJ...487L.155S\">mystery</a> though -- it may be a central disk of dense gas or a central \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field\">magnetic field</a>.   \n\nThe rapid expansion itself, however, has cooled molecules in the \nnebular gas to about one degree above absolute zero - colder than even the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/faq_basic.html\">cosmic background radiation</a> - making it the \ncoldest known region in the distant Universe. \n\nShining with light from the central star reflected by dust, the frigid \n<a href=\"ap030220.html\">Boomerang Nebula</a> is believed to be a \nstar or stellar system evolving toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebula</a> phase.  \n\nTo help better understand the Boomerang's origin, \nastronomers are studying the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/25/image/a\">above image</a> taken in \n<a href=\"http://acept.la.asu.edu/PiN/rdg/polarize/polarize.shtml\">polarized light</a>, \ncolor coded by an angular direction associated with the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization\">polarization</a>.  \n\nDifferent progenitor scenarios create different amounts and patterns of \n<a href=\"ap050226.html\">polarized light</a>.   \n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/25/image/a\">above image</a> was taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a> earlier this year.  \n\nThe Boomerang Nebula spans about one \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/question94.htm\">light year</a> and lies about 5,000 light years away toward the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation\">constellation</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/centaurus.html\">Centaurus</a>.",
