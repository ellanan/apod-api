  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen the planet Mercury?  \n\nThis week might be a good time.\n\nBecause <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html\">Mercury</a> \norbits so close to the Sun, it never wanders far from the Sun in Earth's sky. \n\nIf trailing the Sun, Mercury will be \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/sky_calendar.html\">visible</a> \nlow on the horizon for only a short while after \n<a href=\"ap031021.html\">sunset</a>. \n\nIf leading the Sun, Mercury will be \n<a href=\"http://www.almanac.com/astronomy/moon/index.php\">visible</a> only shortly before <a href=\"ap030320.html\">sunrise</a>. \n\nSo at certain times of the year an informed \n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">skygazer</a> with a little determination can usually \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/almanac/\">pick Mercury out</a> \nfrom a site with an clear horizon. \n\nAbove, a lot of determination has been combined with a \nlittle digital trickery to show \n<a href=\"ap030412.html\">Mercury's successive positions</a> \nduring March of 2004. \n\nEach picture was taken from the same location in Leeds, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uk.html\">England</a> exactly 33 minutes after sunset.  \n\nOver the next two weeks, <a href=\"ap040606.html\">Mercury</a> \nwill again be well placed for \n<a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/public/nightsky.html\">viewing</a> above the western horizon at sunset, \nbut by the third week in March it will have faded \nand dropped into the <a href=\"ap040501.html\">twilight</a>.",
