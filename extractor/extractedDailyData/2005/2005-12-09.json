  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you've been outdoors near sunset, then you've probably\nnoticed <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\nvenusfact.html\">Venus</a> low in the west as the\n<a href=\"http://www.digitalsky.org.uk/venus/\nshadow-of-venus.html\">brilliant evening star</a>.\n\nSometimes <a href=\"ap050609.html\">mistaken</a> for a tower light\nnear the horizon,\nVenus is the third brightest celestial beacon, after\nthe Sun and Moon, in planet Earth's sky.\n\nThat distinction is particularly easy to appreciate in\n<a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/missouri_skies/image/53158060\">this\npeaceful scene</a> featuring the crescent Moon, Venus, and\n<a href=\"http://www.missouriskies.org/\nsunset_gallery/sunsetgallery.html\">sunset colors</a> captured on\nDecember 4th near Albany, Missouri, USA.\n\nAs this season's evening star,\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/\">Venus</a>\nwill be at its most brilliant\ntonight, but as December progresses the <a href=\"ap040521.html\">bright\nplanet</a> will begin to\n<a href=\"ap990903.html\">fall out</a> of the western sky.\n\nBy early next week, December's Moon will have moved on to meet\nanother bright planet <a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/almanac/\ns200512_alm.html\">overhead -- Mars</a>.",
