  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did this strange-looking galaxy form?  \n\nAstronomers turn detectives when trying to \nfigure out the cause of unusual jumbles of stars, gas, and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> like \n<a href=\"ap990222.html\">NGC 1316</a>.  \n\n\nA preliminary inspection indicates that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004ASPC..322..469G\">NGC 1316</a> is an enormous \n<a href=\"ap991121.html\">elliptical galaxy</a> \nthat includes dark dust lanes usually found in a spiral. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2005/11/index.html\">above image</a> taken by the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nshows details, however, that help in \nreconstructing the history of this gigantic jumble.  \n\nClose <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2005/11/caption.html\">inspection finds</a> fewer low mass \n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular clusters</a> \nof stars toward NGC 1316's center.\n\nSuch an effect is expected in galaxies that have undergone \n<a href=\"ap041121.html\">collisions</a> or \nmerging with other galaxies in the past few billion years.  \n\nAfter such collisions, many \n<a href=\"ap030915.html\">star clusters</a> would be \ndestroyed in the dense galactic center.  \n\nThe dark knots and <a href=\"ap020421.html\">lanes of dust</a> \nindicate that one or more of the devoured galaxies were \n<a href=\"ap001102.html\">spiral</a> galaxies.  \n\n<a href=\"ap000816.html\">NGC 1316</a> \nspans about 60,000 light years and lies about 75 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away toward the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=37\">Furnace</a>.",
