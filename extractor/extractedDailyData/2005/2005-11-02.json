  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThese two moons change places.  \n\n<a href=\"ap050429.html\">Epimetheus</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/janus.html\">Janus</a>, \ntwo small moons of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>, \nactually switch positions as they orbit their home planet.   \n\nThe orbital radii of the moons are strangely separated by less than the \nradii of the moons themselves: about 50 kilometers.  \n\nOne moon orbits Saturn well ahead of the other, at first.  \n\nAs the two moons gravitationally attract, they approach each other and, every few years, actually \n<a href=\"http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/epimetheus_and_janus.html\">pass and trade orbits</a>.   \n\nThis <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997APS..OFS...G01B\">strange dance</a> creates speculation that \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/saturn/epimetheus.html\">Epimetheus</a> and Janus were once joined and later split from each other.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07615\">Pictured above</a>, \nthe two moons were photographed rounding their orbits just outside of \n<a href=\"ap951223.html\">Saturn's F ring</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07615\">above image</a> was taken in early September by the robot \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens\">Cassini spacecraft</a>, \nalso orbiting Saturn.",
