  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat happens when you crash into a comet?\n\nThat was a question considered by\n<a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/bios.html\">astronomers</a> when they designed the \n<a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html\">Deep Impact mission</a>,\nlaunched in January.  \n\nThis coming July 4, the Deep Impact spaceship will reach its target - \n<a href=\"ap050512.html\">Comet Tempel 1</a> -- and release an impactor over five times the mass of a person toward its surface.  \n\nThe mothership will photograph the result.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/deepimpact/di_crater.html\">remaining crater</a> may tell how Tempel 1 is constructed.  \n\nIf, for example, <a href=\"http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/science/tempel1.html\">Comet Tempel 1</a> is an extremely loose pile of debris, \nthe impactor may leave little or no discernable crater.  \n\nOn the other hand, if the comet's surface is relatively firm, \nthe impactor's ripple may leave quite a large crater.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/deepimpact/contest_enter.html\">contest is even being held</a> to predict the size of the resulting crater.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/deepimpact/di.html\">Pictured above</a> \nis an artist's impression of the initial encounter between the spacecraft\nand the comet.",
