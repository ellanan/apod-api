  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes gamma-ray bursts?  \n\nThe most energetic type of explosions known in the cosmos has been an enigma since \n<a href=\"ap000702.html\">discovered over 30 years ago</a>.  \n\nIt now appears that there may <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/heapow/archive/transients/grb050709_hete.html\">not be one</a> unique type of progenitor.  \n\nLong duration \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/bursts.html\">gamma-ray bursts</a> (GRBs) have been \n<a href=\"ap990210.html\">localized</a>, over the past few years, to \n<a href=\"ap040426.html\">blue regions</a> in the universe rich in star formation.  \n\nMassive young stars nearing the end of their short lives commonly explode in these regions.  \n\nAstronomers associate these \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/grbs_duration.html\">long duration GRBs</a>, that can last from seconds to minutes, \nwith a type of stellar explosion common in young massive stars.  \n\nOver the past few months, short duration GRBs have finally been \n<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/gamma-ray.html\">localized</a> and found to occur in different types of regions -- not only \nblue regions rich in star formation.  \n\nMany astronomers therefore now theorize that \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/short_grbs.html\">short GRBs</a>, which typically last less than one second, are the result of a \n<a href=\"http://universe.nasa.gov/press/2003/030220a.html\">different progenitor process</a> \nthan long GRBs.  \n\nA leading model is that a short GRB will occur when a \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.umd.edu/~miller/nstar.html\">neutron star</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510379\">either impacts</a> \nanother neutron star or a \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/black_holes.html\">black hole</a>.   \n\nSuch collisions may occur well after star-forming regions have otherwise burned out.\n\nPictured in the <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/heapow/archive/transients/grb050509b_swift.html\"> above illustration</a>, two energized \n<a href=\"ap050515.html\">neutrons stars finally approach</a> \neach other in their orbits, a death spiral that might end with a short GRB.",
