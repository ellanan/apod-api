  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's that unusual looking spot on asteroid Itokawa?  It's the shadow of the \n\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/hayabusa.html\">robot spacecraft Hayabusa</a> \nthat took the image.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html\">Japan</a>'s \nHayabusa mission \n<a href=\"ap050919.html\">arrived</a> at the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a> \nin early September and has been imaging and maneuvering around the \nfloating space mountain ever since.    \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/j/snews/2005/1110_hayabusa.shtml\">above picture</a> was taken earlier this month.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25143_Itokawa\">Asteroid Itokawa</a> \nspans about 300 meters.  \n\nOne scientific goal of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa\">Hayabusa mission</a> \nis to determine out how much ice, rock and trace elements reside on the \nasteroid's surface, which should give indications about how asteroids and \nplanets formed in the early Solar System.  \n\nA can-sized robot MINERVA that was scheduled to hop \naround the asteroid's surface has \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/ap_051113_probe_lost.html\">not, so far, functioned</a> as hoped.   \n\nLater this month, \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/051103_hayabusa_update.html\">Hayabusa</a> is scheduled to <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/1114_Hayabusa_Japan_Conducts_Landing_test.html\">descend to asteroid Itokawa</a> and collect surface samples in a \nreturn capsule. \n\nIn December, Hayabusa will fire its rockets toward Earth and drop the \n<a href=\"ap040914.html\">return capsule</a> down to Earth's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback\">Australian outback</a> in 2007 June.",
