  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMethane rain, evaporating lakes, flowing rivers, \nand water ice-volcanoes all likely exist on Saturn's moon Titan, \naccording to \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html\">preliminary analyses</a> of <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html\">recent images</a> taken by the successful \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMTV82VQUD_0.html\">Huygens lander</a>.  \n\nA snaking and branching riverbed is identified with the \ndark channel near the top of the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07236\">above image</a>, while a dark lakebed is identified across the image bottom.  \n\nBoth the riverbed and lakebed were \n<a href=\"http://www.floridatoday.com/blogs/011405huygens/\">thought</a> \nto be dry at the time the image was taken but contained a flowing liquid - likely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> - in the recent past.  \n\n<a href=\"ap050117.html\">Titan's surface</a> was found to appear <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images_topic.php3?img_id=16794&amp;topic=land\">strangely similar</a> to Earth even though it is so cold that \n<a href=\"ap041124.html\">methane flows</a> and water freezes into rock-hard ice. \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/huygens-mission.cfm\">Huygens probe</a> has now run \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-011405.html\">out of power</a>, the images it returned will likely be studied for \ndecades to come.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">Cassini mothership</a> is \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/saturn-tour.cfm\">scheduled to continue</a> to orbit \n<a href=\"saturn.html\">Saturn</a> and return images for several more years.",
