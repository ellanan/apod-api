  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSo far, the Aurora Borealis or\n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/\">Northern\nLights</a> have made some\nremarkable visits to\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/aurora/\ngallery_01sep05_page5.htm\">September's skies</a>.\n\nThe reason, of course, is the\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/\n15sep_solarminexplodes.htm\">not-so-quiet Sun</a>.\n\nIn particular, a large solar active region now crossing\nthe Sun's disk has produced\nmultiple, intense flares and a large coronal mass ejection\n(<a href=\"http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme.html\">CME</a>) that\ntriggered wide spread auroral activity just last weekend.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/photo_geo/nouv.html\">colorful example</a>\nof spectacular curtains of aurora\nwas captured with a fish-eye lens in skies over Quebec, Canada\non September 11.\n\nAlso featured is the\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/\n07jul_marshoax.htm\">planet Mars</a>, the brightest\nobject above and left of center.\n\nSeen near Mars (just below and to the right) is the tightly knit\n<a href=\"ap050414.html\">Pleiades</a> star cluster.\n\nAlthough they can appear to be quite close,\nthe northern lights actually originate at extreme altitudes,\n100 kilometers or so above the Earth's surface.",
