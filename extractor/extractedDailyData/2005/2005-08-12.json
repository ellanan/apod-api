  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nGo outside tonight and see a celestial light show -- \nthe later the better.  \n\nTonight is the peak of the month-long \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/22jul_perseids2005.htm\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>.  \n\nAlthough visible every year at this time, the \n<a href=\"http://www.jackstargazer.com/scripts0SG0531.html\">Perseids</a> are expected to appear particularly active\nthis year due to the relative absence of glare from the Moon during the peak.   \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/meteors/article_1557_1.asp\">Tonight</a>, a thin moon will set a \nfew hours after the Sun, leaving a moonless and dark sky.  \n\nAll through the night, all over the sky, \n<a href=\"http://space.com/searchforlife/050811_seti_perseids.html\">meteors</a> will appear to shoot out the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Perseus.html\">constellation Perseus</a> and across the sky.  \n\nThe rate of meteors and \n<a href=\"ap991202.html\">fireballs</a> is not known for sure, \nbut expected by some to be as high as \none meteor flash every minute.  \n\n<a href=\"ap991117.html\">Lucky</a> <a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky gazers</a> \nmight be treated to a bright fireball like the one pictured above.  \n\nThat fireball was \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/meteors/gallery_12aug05.html\">captured</a> by a digital recorded over \n<a href=\"http://nightskylive.net/wo/\">Wise Observatory</a> \nduring the 2001 Leonid Meteor Shower.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap031116.html\">meteor shower</a> \nposes no danger as few, if any, of the \nsand-sized flaring bits are expected to reach the ground.",
