  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWas the brightest Galactic blast yet recorded a \nkey to connecting two types of celestial explosions?  \n\nLast December, a dense sheet of \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/gamma.html\">gamma rays</a> only a few times wider than the Earth \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/watchtheskies/swift_nsu_0205.html\">plowed through</a> our Solar System, saturating \nsatellites and noticeably \n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/2923.gcn3\">reflecting off the Moon</a>.  \n\nA <a href=\"ap041126.html\">magnetar</a> near our \n<a href=\"ap041107.html\">Galactic Center</a>, the source of \n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/extreme_machines/1280796.html\">Soft Gamma Repeater</a> (SGR) 1806-20, \nhad unleashed its \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502329\">largest flare</a> on record.  \n\nThe brightness and briefness of the tremendous explosion's \ninitial peak made it look \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502329\">quite similar</a> \nto another type of tremendous explosion if viewed from further \naway -- a short duration gamma-ray burst (GRB).  \n\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/short_grbs.html\">Short duration GRBs</a> are thought by many to be \nfundamentally different than their \n<a href=\"ap030325.html\">long duration GRB</a> cousins that are likely \n<a href=\"ap020517.html\">related</a> to distant \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernovas</a>.  \n\nIllustrated above is a series of drawings depicting \nan outgoing explosion during the initial SGR spike.  \n\nA fast moving wave of radiation is pictured\nshooting away from a central \n<a href=\"http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/magnetar.html\">magnetar</a>.   \n\nThe possible link between SGRs and GRBs should become \nbetter understood as more and similar events are \ndetected by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Swift satellite</a>.",
