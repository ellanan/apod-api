  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus? \n\nA strange ridge crosses the moon near the equator, \nvisible near the bottom of the above image, making \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/iapetus.html\">Iapetus</a> \nappear similar to the \n<a href=\"http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/syllabi/319/1peach.html\">pit of a peach</a>.  \n\nHalf of <a href=\"ap951015.html\">Iapetus</a> \nis so dark that it can nearly disappear when viewed from Earth.  \n\nRecent observations show that the degree of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004Icar..170..125V\">darkness of the terrain</a> is strangely uniform, \nlike a dark coating was somehow recently applied \nto an ancient and highly cratered surface.  \n\nThe other half of <a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/iapetus.htm\">Iapetus</a> is relatively bright but oddly covered with long and \nthin streaks of dark.  \n\nA 400-kilometer wide impact basin is visible near the image center, \ndelineated by deep <a href=\"ap970218.html\">scarps</a> \nthat drop sharply to the crater floor.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06166\">above image</a> was taken by the Saturn-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">Cassini spacecraft</a> during a \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/saturn-tour.cfm\">flyby</a> of Iapetus at the end of last year.",
