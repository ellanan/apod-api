  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat lies on the floor of this Martian crater?  \n\nA frozen patch of water ice.  \n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMNS75V9ED_0.html\">Mars Express</a> spacecraft took the \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v435/n7043/full/435723b.html&amp;filetype=pdf\">above image</a> in early February.   \n\nThe ice pocket was found in a 35-kilometer \nwide crater that resides 70 degrees north of the \n<a href=\"ap010628.html\">Martian equator</a>.  \n\nThere, sunlight is blocked by the 300-meter tall \ncrater wall from <a href=\"http://www.thursdaysclassroom.com/13jul00/article1.html\">vaporizing</a> the water-ice on the \ncrater floor into the <a href=\"http://calspace.ucsd.edu/marsnow/library/science/climate_history/general_circulation_of_the_atmosphere1.html\">thin Martian atmosphere</a>.\n\nThe ice pocket may be as deep as 200 meters thick.  \n\nFrost can be seen around the inner edge on the upper right part of the \n<a href=\"ap050308.html\">crater</a>, while part of the lower left \ncrater wall is bathed in sunlight.  \n\nThe existence of water-ice pockets inside craters near the\n<a href=\"ap021224.html\">Martian North Pole</a>, like that \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v435/n7043/full/435723b.html&amp;filetype=pdf\">pictured above</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC99/pdf/2026.pdf\">others noted previously</a>, give clues not only about \nsurface conditions in the Martian past but also \n<a href=\"ap050228.html\">possible places</a> where future \n<a href=\"http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/\">water-based astronauts</a> \nmight do well to land.",
