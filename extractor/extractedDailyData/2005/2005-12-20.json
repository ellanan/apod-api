  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs there a road to the stars?  \n\nPossibly there are many, but the \n<a href=\"http://www.hawaiihighways.com/photos-observatories-roads.htm\">physical road pictured above</a> leads up to the top of a dormant volcano that is a \n<a href=\"ap050704.html\">premier spot</a> on planet \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">Earth</a> for \nobserving stars and astronomical phenomena.  \n\nAt the top of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii\">Hawaii</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea\">Mauna Kea</a> \nare some of the largest optical telescopes on Earth, including the \n<a href=\"ap971227.html\">Keck telescopes</a>, \n<a href=\"ap030909.html\">Gemini</a>, \n<a href=\"ap990201.html\">Subaru</a>, \n<a href=\"ap000905.html\">CFHT</a>, and the \n<a href=\"ap960904.html\">IRTF</a>.  \n\nTogether, these 10-meter eyes have made many universe-redefining discoveries, \nincluding detailing that most of the universe is made not of familiar matter but of mysterious \n<a href=\"http://astron.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/darkmatter/dm.html\">dark matter</a> and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?set_albumName=Previous-Featured-Images&amp;id=MKInverTrail&amp;option=com_gallery&amp;Itemid=39&amp;include=view_photo.php\">above picture</a> was compiled from over 150 one-minute exposures from a \n<a href=\"http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/digital-camera.htm\">digital camera</a>.  \n\nDuring that time, the \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">rotation of the Earth</a> \nmade the stars far in the distance appear to have long \n<a href=\"ap040911.html\">star trails</a>.  \n\nThe foreground landscape was illuminated by the \n<a href=\"ap020316.html\">Moon</a>.",
