  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis huge puff ball was once a star.  \n\nOne thousand years ago, in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1006\">year 1006</a>, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1006\">new star was recorded</a> \nin the sky that today we know was really an existing star exploding.  \n\nThe resulting expanding gas from the \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a> \nis still visible with telescopes today, continues to expand, and now spans over 70 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a>.  \n\nSN 1006 glows in every type of light.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2005/sn1006/\">above image</a> of SN 1006 was captured by the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra Observatory</a> \nin <a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/xrays.html\">X-ray</a> light.  \n\nEven today, not everything about the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/Misc/sn1006.html\">SN 1006</a> \nis understood, for example why \n<a href=\"ap030609.html\">particle shocks</a> \nthat produce the bright blue filaments are only visible at some locations.  \n\n<a href=\"ap030317.html\">SN 1006</a> is thought to have once been a \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/dwarfs.html\">white dwarf</a> that exploded when gas being dumped onto it by its \n<a href=\"ap031110.html\">binary star</a> companion caused it to go over the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit\">Chandrasekhar limit</a>.  \n\nForeground stars are visible that have nothing to do with the supernova.",
