  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat caused this great white spot on the surface of Saturn's moon Rhea?  \n\nThe spot was first noticed last year by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/saturn.htm\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nCassini's flyby of <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/rhea.html\">Rhea</a> in April <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06648\">imaged</a> in the spot in great detail.  \n\nAstronomers <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-details.cfm?imageID=1526\">hypothesize</a> that the light-colored spot is the \nresult of a relatively recent \n<a href=\"http://www.spacegrant.hawaii.edu/class_acts/CratersTe.html\">impact</a> on the surface of the icy moon.  \n\nThe impact that likely created the crater also splashed \nlight-colored material from the interior onto the darker surface.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_%28mythology%29\">Rhea</a> spans 1,500 kilometers across and is the second \nlargest moon of Saturn after \n<a href=\"ap050518.html\">Titan</a>.  \n\nRhea sports several other \n<a href=\"ap050215.html\">light colored surface features</a> \nthat are, as yet, not well understood.",
