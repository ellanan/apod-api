  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid this meteor leave a twisting path?  Evidently.  \n\n<a href=\"ap011130.html\">Meteor trains</a> \nthat twist noticeably are rare - \nand even more rarely photographed - but have been \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003ChA%26A..27..435G\">noted before</a>.  \n\nThe underlying reason for \n<a href=\"ap981127.html\">unusual meteor trains</a> \nis that many meteors are markedly non-spherical \nin shape and non-uniform in composition.  \n\nMeteors, usually sand sized grains that originate in comets, \nwill disintegrate as they enter the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.  \n\nNon-uniform <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/meteorites.html\">meteors</a> may evaporate more on one side than another.  \n\nThis may cause a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004AGUFMSH51D0295K\">rotating meteor</a> to wobble slightly in its path, \nand also to \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998JIMO...26..220S\">spray fast moving debris</a> \nin a nearly spiral path.  \n\nThe fast moving meteor debris ionizes molecules in the \nEarth's atmosphere that <a href=\"ap020816.html\">subsequently glow</a> when they reacquire \n<a href=\"http://www.aip.org/history/electron/\">electrons</a>.  \n\nSurely no meteor is perfectly uniform and spherical, so that \na slight swagger that is below perceptibility is likely typical.  \n\nMeteors may well have seeded \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a> with the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AstHe..95..515A>organic materials</a> \nand <a href=\" http:=\"\" adsabs.harvard.edu=\"\" cgi-bin=\"\" nph-bib_query?bibcode=\"2004IAUS..213..281J&quot;\">prebiotic molecules</a> that allowed for the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolution\">development of life</a>.",
