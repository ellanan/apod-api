  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nBroken metal and scorched \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> \nmake the impact site of Opportunity's heat shield one \nof the more interesting sites inspected by the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/\">rolling robot</a>.   \n\nVisible on the <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07327\">image</a> left is the conical outer hull of the shattered \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/mission/spacecraft_edl_aeroshell.html\">heat shield</a> expelled by \n<a href=\"ap040127.html\">Opportunity</a> as it plummeted toward Mars last year.  \n\nScrolling right will show not only another section of the \nheat shield but the \n<a href=\"ap050121.html\">impact site</a> itself.  \n\nThe site is of interest partly because \nits creation was relatively well understood.  \n\nThe impact splattered subsurface light red dirt, \nwhile a darker material appears to track toward the large debris.  \n\nBehind the impromptu <a href=\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/\">space exhibit</a> lies a vast \n<a href=\"ap040114.html\">alien landscape</a> of featureless plains and \n<a href=\"ap970804.html\">rust-tinted sky</a>.",
