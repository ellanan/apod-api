  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe surface of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>'s\n moon Tethys is riddled with icy cliffs and craters.  \n\nThe most detailed images ever taken of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_%28moon%29\">Tethys</a> \nwere captured late last month as the robot \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">Cassini spacecraft</a> \nswooped past the frozen ice moon.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07734\">above image</a> was taken from about 32,000 kilometers distant and \nshows a jagged landscape of long cliffs covered with craters.  \n\nAt the bottom of many craters appears some sort of unknown light-colored substance, \nin contrast to the unknown dark substance that appears at the bottom of Saturn's moon \n<a href=\"ap051003.html\">Hyperion</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/tethys.html\">Tethys</a> is one of the \nlarger moons of Saturn, spanning about 1,000 kilometers across.   \n\nThe density of <a href=\"ap041129.html\">Tethys</a> indicates a composition \nalmost entirely of \n<a href=\"http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/info_water.htm\">water ice</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/tethys.htm\">Tethys</a> \nis thought to have been predominantly liquid sometime in its distant past, \ncreating some of its long ice-<a href=\"ap050315.html\">cliffs</a> \nas it cracked during \n<a href=\"http://www.word-detective.com/howcome/waterexpand.html\">freezing</a>.",
