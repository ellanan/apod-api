  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/0797issue/0797fishman.html\">Gamma-ray bursts</a> are thought to be the most powerful explosions in\nthe Universe, yet the cause of these high-energy flashes\n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/nasm/VU/overview/bursts/bursts.html\">remains a mystery</a>.\n\nBlindingly\n<a href=\"ap961001.html\">bright</a> for\n<a href=\"http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/data/grb/skymap/\">space-based gamma-ray detectors</a> the burst sources are\nso faint at visible wavelengths that\nlarge telescopes and sensitive cameras are required to search for them.\n\n<a href=\"ap971218.html\">The faint optical flash</a> from\na relatively intense gamma-ray burst\ndetected on December 14th of last year seems to have originated in\nthe galaxy indicated in\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/17/\">this Hubble Space Telescope image</a> - taken\nmonths after the burst had faded from view.\n\n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/%7Egeorge/grb/grb971214.html\">Astronomers have recently announced</a> that\nthis galaxy's spectrum, recorded using the large\n<a href=\"http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu:3636/\">Keck telescope</a> atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea,\nindicates that it lies at a distance of about <i>12 billion light-years</i>.\n\nThe energy required to produce the observed flash of gamma-rays from\nthis distance would be staggering!\n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/17/pr.html\">Some estimates suggest</a> that in a few seconds the\nburster released the equivalent energy of several hundred\n<a href=\"ap980418.html\">supernovae (exploding stars)</a>.\n\nThe eruption of such a large amount of energy in such a short time is\nso extreme that even\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9802112\">exotic theoretical models</a>\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9802094\">of the bursters</a> are being challenged.\n\nCould the bursts be caused by\n<a href=\"http://wugrav.wustl.edu/nsnsgc/nsnsgc.html\">the cataclysmic merger</a> of\nneutron stars\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9712019\">with black holes</a> ... or something as yet unknown?",
