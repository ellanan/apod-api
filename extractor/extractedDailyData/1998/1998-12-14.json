  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAmong the faintest objects are some \nof the most unusual objects.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdfsouth/hdfs.html\">Hubble Deep Field South</a> was \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/41/pr.html\">released</a> after much anticipation earlier this month, \ndelivering a \n<a href=\"ap981202.html\">unique view</a> of some of the most \ndistant parts of our universe.  Part of this field is shown above. \n\nNumerous astronomers are currently poring over this field, \ntrying to find clues about \n<a href=\"ap980324.html\">young galaxies</a>, \n<a href=\"ap980302.html\">cosmological curvature</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Xray/dark_matter.html\">dark matter</a>.  \n\nClearly, visible among galaxies as dim as \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 30 in \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/41/\">this long-duration exposure</a> (and in the original \n<a href=\"ap980607.html\">Hubble Deep Field North</a>) are many\n<a href=\"ap970617.html\">peculiar looking galaxies</a>.\n\nOne interesting artifact is the blue arc just \nto the upper right of the large galaxy near the image center.  \n\nThis arc may be light from a more distant galaxy focused by the \n<a href=\"ap980614.html\">gravitational lens effect</a> \nof the nearer galaxy.",
