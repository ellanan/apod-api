  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSince the early days of\n<a href=\"http://www.databahn.net/library/inet/history/\">radio and television</a>\nwe have been freely broadcasting signals into space.\n\nFor some time now,\n<a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/intro/ham.connection.html\">we have been listening too</a>.\n\nOhio State University's radio telescope,\naffectionately <a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/\">known as \"The Big Ear\" </a>,\nwas one of the first and largest listeners.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/kraus.htm\">Designed by John Kraus</a>, OSU's Big Ear (about the size of three\nfootball fields) consisted of an immense metal ground plane with \ntwo fence-like reflectors (one fixed and one tiltable) and\nrelied on\n<a href=\"ap980912.html\">the Earth's rotation</a> to help scan the sky.\n\nThis photo, taken by former Big Ear student volunteer Rick Scott,\nlooks out across the ground plane toward the fixed reflector with the\n\"receiver horns\" in the foreground.\n\nThis May, <a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/flatdown.htm\">the final pieces</a> of the Big Ear were torn down, but its\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/past.htm\">explorations of the radio universe</a> will be long remembered.\n\n<br><br>\n\nStarting in 1965, the Big Ear was used in an ambitious\npremier survey of\n<a href=\"ap971214.html\">the radio sky</a>,\nultimately finding over 20,000\n<a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/intro/\">celestial radio sources</a>.\n\nChanging its focus in the 1970s, it became the first telescope to\n<a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/game/\">continuously listen</a> for\n<a href=\"http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/\">signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.</a>\n\nFor an\n<a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/phoenix/contact.html\">exciting moment</a> during August 1977 a very strong\nand unanticipated signal,\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/wowmenu.htm\">dubbed the Wow! Signal</a>, was detected by the Big Ear.\n\nBut alas,\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/wow20th.htm\">heard only once</a>,\nthe cause of the signal could not be determined.",
