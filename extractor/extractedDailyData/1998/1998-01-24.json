  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.skittler.demon.co.uk/magellan.htm\">Ferdinand Magellan</a> and his\ncrew had plenty of time to study\n<a href=\"http://www.saao.ac.za/\">the southern sky</a> during their\nfamous voyage around the world.\n\nAs a result, two fuzzy cloud-like\nobjects, not visible to\n<a href=\"http://www.lochness.com/tcapage.html\">northern hemisphere dwellers</a>,\nare now known as the Clouds of Magellan.\n\nThese star clouds are small <a href=\"ap971114.html\">irregular galaxies</a>,\nsatellites of our larger <a href=\"ap970517.html\">Milky Way spiral galaxy</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/lmc.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a>\npictured above is only about 180,000 light-years distant - the\nonly known galaxy closer is the\n<a href=\"ap970329.html\">Sagittarius Dwarf</a>.\n\nBoth the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\nare joined to the\n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way</a> by a\n<a href=\"http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/papers/moore/stream/stream.html\">stream of cold hydrogen gas.</a>\n\nAn unusual effect called <a href=\"ap960424.html\">gravitational lensing</a>\nhas <a href=\"ap960202.html\">recently been detected in a few LMC stars</a>,\nand there is hope this could tell us important information about\nthe true composition of our universe.",
