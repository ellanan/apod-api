  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe first hint of what will become of our <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> was discovered inadvertently in 1764.  \nAt that time, <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/biograph.html\">Charles Messier</a> was compiling a list of \n\"annoying\" diffuse objects not to be confused with \n\"interesting\" comets.  The 27th object on \n<a href=\"ap960626.html\">Messier's list</a>, \nnow known as M27 or the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m027.html\">Dumbbell Nebula</a>, is a \n<a href=\"ap971223.html\">planetary nebula</a>, \nthe type of nebula our \n<a href=\"ap971120.html\">Sun</a> will produce when \nnuclear fusion stops in its core.  M27 is one of the brightest \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebulae</a> on the sky, and \n<a href=\"ap970220.html\">can be seen</a> in the constellation \n<a href=\"http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/VUL.html\">Vulpecula</a> with binoculars.  \nIt takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27.  \nUnderstanding the physics and significance of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/twn/n6853x.html\">M27</a> was well beyond 18th century science.  \nEven today, many things remain mysterious about \n<a href=\"ap980119.html\">bipolar planetary nebula</a> \nlike M27, including the physical mechanism that \nexpels a low-mass star's gaseous outer-envelope, \nleaving an \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#X-ray\">X-ray</a> hot \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf</a>.",
