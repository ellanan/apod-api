  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMost stars appear only as points of light.  Early last year, \n<a href=\"ap970216.html\">Betelgeuse</a> became the second star, \nafter our \n<a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a>, \nto have it surface resolved.  \nLater last year, \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/whatsup/mira.html\">Mira</a> was added \nto the list.  Mira A is a \n<a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/RGO/leaflets/star/star.html\">red \ngiant star</a> undergoing dramatic pulsations, causing it to become more than \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/stardial/variables/mira.html\">100 times brighter</a> over the course of a year.  \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/26/PR.html\">Mira</a> \nwas discovered to be the first variable star 401 years ago today \nby David Fabricus.  \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E482L%2E175K&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Mira</a> can extend to over 700 times the size of our Sun, \nand is only 400 light-years away.  The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/26.html\">above photograph</a> \ntaken by the <a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nshows the true face of Mira.  But what are we seeing?  \nThe unusual extended feature off the lower left of the star \nremains somewhat mysterious.  \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/captions/97-26a.txt\">Possible \nexplanations</a> include gravitational perturbation and/or heating \nfrom Mira's \n<a href=\"ap961203.html\">white dwarf star</a> companion",
