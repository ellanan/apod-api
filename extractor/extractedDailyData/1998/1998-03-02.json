  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIn a \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.ucla.edu/dm98/dmagenda1.html\">meeting</a> in California two weeks ago, unpublished <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/SCIENCE/SCIENCE/t000019519.html\">results were presented</a> indicating that \nmost of the energy in our universe is not in stars or galaxies but\nis tied to space itself.  \nIn the language of cosmologists, a large \n<a href=\"http://super.colorado.edu/~michaele/lambda.html\">cosmological constant</a> is directly implied by new distant \n<a href=\"ap980217.html\">supernovae</a> observations.\n\nSuggestions of a cosmological constant (lambda) are \n<a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/anthol/fudge.html\">not new</a> -- they have existed since the advent of \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm\">modern relativistic cosmology</a>.  Such claims are \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/1297issue/1297yam.html\">not usually popular</a> with astronomers, though, \nbecause lambda is so unlike known universe components,\nbecause \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E466%2E%2E638K&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=32efca777323982\">lambda's value appears limited by observations</a>,\nand because less-strange cosmologies without lambda \nhave historically done well in explaining the data.  \n\nTherefore most lamdba claims do not make the News Summary in a \nprestigious journal like \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/\">Science</a>.  \n\nWhat is noteworthy here is the seemingly direct \nand reliable method of the observations, \nand the good reputations of the <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/Research/supernova/highz/names.html\">scientists conducting the investigation</a>.  The    \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/02/\">above picture</a> of a supernova at redshift 0.5 in a \n<a href=\"ap970805.html\">spiral</a> galaxy, was taken\nby this collaboration.\n\nHowever, <i> two </i> teams of scientists are \nindependently studying \n<a href=\"ap980114.html\">distant supernovae</a>, \nand the last official word from the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1998Natur%2E391%2E%2E%2E51P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=33613e8e5809859&amp;nosetcookie=1\">other team</a> was a <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/AAS_winter-sn/pr.html\">result</a> consistent with no cosmological constant, \nreported just two months ago.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aliens/carlsagan.html\">Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</a>, \nand so cosmologists the world over eagerly await \npeer-reviewed results, further details, and more data.",
