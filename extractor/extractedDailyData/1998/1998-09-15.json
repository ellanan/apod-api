  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat happens if you point a large telescope at nothing?  \nThe above <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/NEWNTT/telescope/esontt.html\">New Technology Telescope</a> <a href=\"http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/NEWNTT/susi/susi.html\">SUSI</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/science/ndf/\">Deep Field photograph</a> isolated a small patch of \nsky picked to contain no bright objects at all.  \n\nA very long exposure was then taken, similar to the \n<a href=\"ap980607.html\">Hubble Deep Field</a>, \nin order to see the many faint objects that are usually \nwashed out by the light of \n<a href=\"ap960526.html\">bright foreground objects</a>.  \n\nWhat remains is a cosmic wallpaper rich in \n<a href=\"ap970731.html\">distant galaxies</a>.  \nGalaxies as faint as <a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 26 were found to be irregularly distributed, \nwith several unusual pairings of different colored objects.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/pr-01-98.html\">This</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/hdf.html\">other</a> deep field images are being \nreleased for detailed inspection by anyone interested.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/hdfsouth/hdfs.html\">New</a> deep field images are being planned.",
