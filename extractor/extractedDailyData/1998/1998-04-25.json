  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA massive star ends life as a supernova, blasting\nits outer layers back to interstellar space.\n\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/outreach_pages/supernova.html\">The spectacular death explosion</a> is\ninitiated by the collapse of what has become an impossibly dense\nstellar core.\n\nHowever, this core is not necessarily destroyed.  Instead, it may be\ntransformed into an exotic object with the density of an\natomic nucleus but more total mass\nthan the sun -\n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/nstar.html\">a neutron star</a>.\n\nA neutron star is hard to detect directly because it is\nsmall (roughly 10 miles in diameter)\nand therefore dim, but newly formed in this violent crucible\nit is intensely hot,\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/introduction/\nxray_information.html\">glowing in X-rays</a>.\n\nThese\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/introduction/xray_telescopes.html\">X-ray images</a> from the orbiting ROSAT observatory may offer a premier\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/snr_group/Puppis_A.html\">view of such a recently formed neutron stars' X-ray glow</a>.\n\nPictured is the supernova\nremnant Puppis A, one of the brightest\n<a href=\"ap961008.html\">sources in the X-ray sky</a>,\nwith shocked gas clouds still expanding and\nradiating X-rays.  In the inset close-up view,\na faint pinpoint source of X-rays is visible which is most likely\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/outreach_pages/\nneutron_stars.html\">the young neutron star</a>,\nkicked out by the asymmetric explosion and\nmoving away from the site of the original supernova at about 600 miles\nper second.",
