In this\nanalogy, however, the <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a> would be\na <a href=\"http://www.basecamp.com/example_caterpillar.html\">caterpillar</a>\nand the ejected shell of gas would become the prettiest of all!\n The above cocoon, the <a href=\"ap961121.html\">planetary nebula</a>\ndesignated NGC 2440, <a href=\"ap951130.html\">contains one of the hottest white dwarf stars known</a>.\n The white dwarf can be seen as the bright dot near the photo's\ncenter.  <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/interv.html\">Our Sun will eventually become a \"white dwarf butterfly\"</a>,\nbut not for another 5 billion years.
