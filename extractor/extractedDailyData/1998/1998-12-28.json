  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOn December 23, the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/\">NEAR spacecraft</a> \nflew by asteroid \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/text/eros.txt\">433 Eros</a>.  \n\nNEAR was originally scheduled to brake and orbit Eros, \nbut an <a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/news/flash/98dec22_3.html\">unexpected shutdown</a> \nof its main engine caused this plan to be aborted.  \n\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/near.html\">NEAR</a> will now be reset and attempt to return to \norbit <a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/eros/index.html\">Eros</a> in early 2000.  The above \n\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/news/flash/98dec24_1.html\">image sequence</a> was taken as NEAR approached Eros.  \nThe rotation of the <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a> is visible in the successive frames.  \n\nWhen <a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/iod/000/index.html\">NEAR</a> is fully operational, it will likely \nprovoke the \n<a href=\"ap970513.html\">world's largest telescopes</a> \nto point not toward asteroid Eros but to positions \nindicated by another of NEAR's instruments: its <a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/instruments/XGRS/index.html\">gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector</a>.  \n\nNEAR's distant \n<a href=\"ap971218.html\">GRB</a> detector \nhappens now to be in a \n<a href=\"http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/\">unique position</a> \nto contribute information crucial to the \n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3_archive.html\">rapid acquisition of accurate GRB positions</a>.",
