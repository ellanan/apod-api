  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe dark dusty <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/twn/n3324x.html\">Keyhole Nebula</a> gets \nits name from its unusual shape. Officially designated\nNGC 3324, the \n<a href=\"ap970721.html\">Keyhole Nebula</a> \nis a smaller region superposed on the larger \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/twn/n3372x.html\">Eta Carina Nebula</a>. These nebulae were\ncreated by the dying star \n<a href=\"ap970712.html\">Eta Carina</a>, which is prone to \nviolent outbursts during its final centuries. \n\nNoted and discussed as early as 1840 when a\nspectacular explosion became visible, the\n<a href=\"http://www.adler.uchicago.edu/asnc/eta/eta2.html\">Eta Carina</a> system now appears to be undergoing an\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/~corcoran/eta_car/eta_car_aas191/eta_car_aas191.htm\nl\">unusual period of change</a>. An\n<a href=\"lib/emission.html\">emission nebula</a> \nthat contains much \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a>, \nthe Keyhole Nebula is roughly 9,000 light years distant.\nThis photogenic nebula can be seen in the south \nwith even a small telescope. \nThe Keyhole Nebula was recently \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995A%26A%2E%2E%2E299%2E%2E583C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">discovered</a> to contain highly \nstructured clouds of \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~nlopez/minitel/\">molecular gas</a>.",
