  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe \n<a href=\"ap980127.html\">Orion Nebula</a> \nis visible to the unaided eye as a fuzzy patch near the famous\n<a href=\"ap951114.html\">belt of three stars</a> in the \n<a href=\"http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/constellation.html\">constellation</a> \n<a href=\"ap970523.html\">Orion</a>. The \nabove picture captures a part of the \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/n1976x.html\">Orion Nebula</a> that primarily reflects light from bright Orion stars. This \n<a href=\"index/ReflectionNebulae.html\">reflection nebula</a> appears blue\nbecause the blue light from the neighboring stars scatters more \nefficiently from nebula gas than does red light. \nThe dark lanes are composed of mostly \n<a href=\"ap980116.html\">interstellar dust</a> - fine needle-shaped\ncarbon grains.",
