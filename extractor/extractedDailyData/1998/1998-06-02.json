  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe <a href=\"ap971021.html\">Butterfly Nebula</a> \nis only thousands of years old.  \n\nAs a central star of a \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary system</a> aged, \nit threw off its outer envelopes of gas in a strong <a href=\"http://mars-hotel.ph.msstate.edu/~mhia/data/S/Stellarwind.html\">stellar wind</a>.  The remaining stellar core \nis so hot it ionizes the previously ejected gas, \ncausing it to glow.  \n\nThe different colors of this \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebula</a> are determined by small \ndifferences in its composition.  \n\nThis \n<a href=\"ap971223.html\">bipolar nebula</a> \nwill continue to shine brightly for only a \nfew thousand more years, after which its central star \nwill fade and become a \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf</a> star.
