  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.abcnews.com/sections/\nscience/DailyNews/jupiterovals981014.html\">Sometime in February</a>,\ntwo of three long-lived Jovian storm systems known as\n<a href=\"ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/1998/98-188.txt\"> \"white ovals\" apparently collided and merged</a> --\nforming what is now likely the second\nlargest storm in the Solar System, after the famous\n<a href=\"ap960827.html\">Great Red Spot</a>.\n\nThe whitish, <a href=\"ap970808.html\">oval-shaped storms</a>\nin\n<a href=\"ap970310.html\">Jupiter's banded atmosphere</a>\nhave been\n<a href=\"http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/IJW/\">telescopically studied</a>\nsince the 1930s,\nbut details of this surprising merger are\nunknown as Jupiter and Earth were on opposite sides of\nthe Sun when it happened.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/\ncgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA01477\">The aftermath is shown</a> in the (top panel) Hubble\nSpace Telescope picture, taken in July as part of the evidence\ninvestigators are using to reconstruct the facts of the case.\n\nCentered are\n<a href=\"http://www-pdsimage.jpl.nasa.gov/\ncgi-bin/GCBGenCatalogPage.pl?08221997\">the swirling white clouds</a> of the newly created storm system\nwhich is about as wide as planet Earth.\n\nAt its left is the remaining smaller\nwhite oval which seems to\nbe drifting away from the larger new storm.\n\nAtmospheric temperature data\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/sepo/atjup/atmos/dbovals.html\">from the Galileo spacecraft</a> represented\nin the (bottom panel) false-color image show the new storm as\na dark feature, cooler than its surroundings.",
