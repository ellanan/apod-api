  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe center of galaxy NGC 1808 is bursting with new stars, but why?\nBeing a \n<a href=\"ap970519.html\">barred spiral galaxy</a> makes \n<a href=\"http://sol.stsci.edu/~mutchler/ngc1808.html\">NGC 1808</a> somewhat similar to our own \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \nBut the disk of \n<a href=\"http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~bkoribal/n1808_hi.html\">NGC 1808</a> (inset) is quite warped, \nand its center is unusually bright and blue.  The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/12/\">above picture</a> of NGC 1808's center, \nin representative color, was recently taken by the \n<a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/12/content/prc9812.txt\">released</a> yesterday.  Perhaps \n<a href=\"ap970602.html\">gravitational pull</a> \nfrom a recent pass of neighboring galaxy \nNGC 1792 has caused matter to move inward \nalong NGC 1808's bar, triggering the \n<a href=\"ap960816.html\">burst of star formation</a>.  \nAlso prominent are \n<a href=\"ap971018.html\">blue clusters of stars</a> and \n<a href=\"ap980116.html\">filaments of dark dust</a> \nobscuring even more activity.",
