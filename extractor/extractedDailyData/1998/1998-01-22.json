  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhat did\n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">our Solar System</a> look like\n<a href=\"ap961207.html\">as the planets were forming</a>?\n\nSince the 1980s, astronomers have been pointing\n<a href=\"ap971128.html\">toward Beta Pictoris</a>,\na young, sun-like star a mere 50 light-years\ndistant, as a likely example.\n\nBeta Pic is surrounded by\n<a href=\"ap960119.html\">a disk of dust</a>\nwhich we view nearly edge-on.\nThe dust disk shines by reflected starlight and has been examined with ever\nincreasing detail to search\n<a href=\"http://hrssun.gsfc.nasa.gov/ghrsgh/02b.html\">for signs</a> of planetary formation.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/beta.html\">The trick is to follow the disk</a>\nas close in to the star as possible, without\nbeing overwhelmed by the direct starlight.\n\nTo make\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/03/a-js.html\">this Hubble Space Telescope image</a>, a \n<a href=\"http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/MPIA/Projects/STARS/members/\nkalas/corona.html\">coronagraph</a> was used to block the\ndirect starlight and achieve the closest view yet.\n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/03/pr-gsfc.html\">The false color picture shows</a> the inner section of the\ndusty disk to within nearly 1.5 billion\nmiles of the star itself, about the scale of the orbit of Uranus.\n\nThe obvious warp is\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/03/\">indirect evidence</a>\nthat a planet now orbits this\n<a href=\"ap970611.html\">young sun</a>,\nslightly inclined to the disk.\n\nThe planet's gravitational pull would produce the visible distortion.",
