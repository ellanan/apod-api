  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/phot-19-98.html\">strangely distorted galaxy of stars</a> is cataloged as NGC 4650A.\n\nIt lies about 165 million light-years away in the southern\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/\nCentaurus.html\">constellation Centaurus</a>.\n\nThe complex system seems to have at least two parts,\na flattened disk of stars with a dense, bright, central core and\na sparse, sharply tilted\n<a href=\"ap980615.html\">ring of gas, dust and stars</a>.\n\nObservations show that the stars in the disk\nand the stars and gas in the\nring really do move in two different, nearly perpendicular planes,\nprobably as the result of a\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/97/34/af3.html\">past galaxy vs. galaxy collision</a>.\n\nThe observed motions within both disk and ring also indicate the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~dursi/dm-tutorial/dm1.html\" <=\"\" a=\"\">presence of \"dark matter\" </a> - an unseen source of gravity which\ninfluences the movement of this system's visible stars.\n\nOver the decades evidence that\n<a href=\"ap980623.html\">our Universe</a> is largely\n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Xray/dark_matter.html\">composed of such dark matter</a> has grown while the\n<a href=\"ap980624.html\">nature of</a> dark matter has\nremained a profound astrophysical mystery.\n\nThe picture was constructed from images made using part of\nthe European Southern Observatory's (ESO) new\n<a href=\"ap960901.html\">Very Large Telescope system</a> now undergoing\nits testing phase.",
