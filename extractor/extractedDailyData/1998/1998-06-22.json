  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created the dust disk in the center of NGC 7052, \nand what keeps it spinning?  \n\nAlthough the disk might appear as a relatively tame \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/22/content/prc9822.txt\">\"hubcap in space\"</a>, \nthe unusual center of \n<a href=\"ap961106.html\">elliptical galaxy</a> \nNGC 7052 is probably the remnant of a \n<a href=\"ap971027.html\">titanic collision</a> between galaxies.  \n\nWhat's more, the disk's spin indicates the \ntremendous gravity of a massive central <a href=\"http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/astro/abholes.html\">black hole</a>.  Analysis of <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/22/pr-photos.html\">this recently released photo</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nindicates that the disk is thousands of <a href=\"http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/exo/light-year.html\">light-year</a>s across, \nrotates faster than 100 kilometers per second, \nat a distance of 150 light-years from the center,\nand contains more mass than a million Suns.  \n\nThe theorized \n<a href=\"ap980409.html\">central black hole</a> is \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=J96-01468&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1&amp;high=33613e8e5809257\">thought to be</a> yet 100 times more massive, \nand may swallow the entire disk in the next few million years.",
