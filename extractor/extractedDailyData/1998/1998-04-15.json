  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap980307.html\">This is NGC 1818</a>,\na youthful, glittering cluster\nof 20,000 stars residing in the\n<a href=\"ap980203.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>,\n164,000 light-years away.\n\nPick a star.  Any star.\n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/16/\">Astronomers might pick</a> the unassuming bluish-white  one (circled)\nwhich appears to be a hot newly formed white dwarf star.\n\nWhat makes it so interesting?\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Quotes/bart.LoveLost.html#3\">standard astronomical wisdom</a>\nsuggests that stars over 5 times\nas massive as the sun rapidly exhaust\ntheir nuclear fuel and end their lives in a\n<a href=\"ap970225.html\">spectacular supernova explosion</a>.\n\nWith less than this critical mass they evolve into\nred giants, pass through a relatively\n<a href=\"ap980403.html\">peaceful planetary nebula</a> phase,\nand calmly fade away as\n<a href=\"ap961203.html\">white dwarf stars</a> like this one.\n\nExcept that as a member of the NGC 1818 cluster,\nthis new white dwarf would have evolved from\n<a href=\"ap970216.html\">a red giant star</a>\nover 7.6 times as massive as the sun - which should have exploded!\n\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9802117\">Its discovery</a>\nwill likely force astronomers to revise the\nlimiting mass estimate for supernovae upward.",
