  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOur <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a> has spots!\nThese spots appear dark in photographs like the one above, but\nin fact sunspots are quite bright - they are just dark compared\nto the rest of the Sun.  <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/sunspots.html\">Sunspots</a> are about the size of the \n<a href=\"ap971026.html\">Earth</a> and\nfrequently occur in groups, as shown above.  <a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/sun/atmosphere/sunspots.html\">Sunspots</a> occur when a concentrated portion of the \nSolar magnetic field pokes through the surface.  \nThis field slows energy from entering the <a href=\"http://www.sunspot.noao.edu/PR/answerbook/sunspots.html\">sunspot</a> region, causing sunspots to appear cooler, \ndarker, and lower than the surrounding surface.  \n<a href=\"ap970108.html\">Sunspots</a> typically last a\nfew days before dissipating.  The number of <a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/Stardate/Scripts/s199509/s19950917.html\">sunspots</a> is always changing, generally going from a \nmaximum to a minimum about every 5 ½ years. \nIn fact, the <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> just passed a minimum two years ago.  \nThe Sun and <a href=\"http://www.cids.org.za/solar/edu/sunspots.htm\">sunspots should never be looked at directly</a>.",
