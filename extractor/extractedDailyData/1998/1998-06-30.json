  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nScroll right and watch the universe evolve.  \n<a href=\"http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~jgc/hubble.html\">Above</a> is a computer simulation depicting the \nevolution of our entire universe.  \n\nOn the far left is a \n<a href=\"ap980623.html\">slice of the universe</a> \nsoon after the <a href=\"http://physics7.berkeley.edu/Education/IUP/Big_Bang_Primer.html\">Big Bang</a> - over 10 billion years ago.  \n\nAs time progresses toward the right, \nthe initially smooth \n<a href=\"ap970821.html\">universe</a> can be seen becoming more and \nmore clumpy.  The vertex near the far right marks the present day.  \n\nThe largest slice of the universe actually surveyed is \nsimulated to the vertex's right.  <a href=\"http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/users/iotm/9805/slice.html\">This artificial universe</a>, called a \n<a href=\"http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~jgc/hubble.html\">Hubble Volume</a>, was designed to mimic what \nhumanity might see were we to have powerful enough telescopes.  \n\nBy comparing different computer simulations to \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9710109\">reality</a>, we might be able to better tell what kind of \n<a href=\"ap980302.html\">universe we live in</a>.",
