  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhile searching the skies above 18th century France for comets,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/biograph.html\">astronomer Charles Messier</a> diligently recorded this object\nas number 27 on his list of things which are\n<a href=\"ap960626.html\">definitely not comets</a>.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nWell, 20th century astronomers would classify it as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">Planetary Nebula</a> ...\nbut it's not a planet either, even though it may\n<a href=\"ap980518.html\">appear round</a>\nand planet-like in a small telescope.\n\nMessier 27 (M27) is now\nknown to be an excellent example of\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/\">a gaseous emission nebula</a> created\nas a <a href=\"ap980426.html\">sun-like star runs out</a>\nof nuclear fuel in its core.\n\nThe nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into\nspace, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying\nstar's intense but invisible\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.\n\nKnown by the popular name of\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m027.html\">the \"Dumbbell Nebula\"</a>, the beautifully\nsymmetric interstellar gas cloud is about 1,200 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Vulpecula.html\">constellation Vulpecula</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/phot-38-98.html\">This gorgeous synthetic color picture of M27</a>\nwas produced during testing of the European Southern Observatory's new\n<a href=\"ap960901.html\">Very Large Telescope</a>.",
