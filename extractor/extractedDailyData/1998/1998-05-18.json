  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy isn't the star in the center of the nebula?  \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/rbc/NGC6369.html\">NGC 6369</a> appears to be a fairly ordinary \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/OLDWWW/users/iotm/9612/nebula.html\">planetary nebula</a>.  It can be seen with a \ngood telescope in the  constellation of \n<a href=\"http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/OPH.html\">Ophiuchus</a>.  The gas expelled by the \ncentral star is bunched in the \nshape of a donut or cylinder.  \n\nDuring the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebula</a> phase, \nthe central star sheds its \nouter atmosphere as it is evolving to become a \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf</a> star.  The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/97/pn/content/ngc6369.jpg\">above image</a> was taken with the \n<a href=\"ap950811.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  \nA closer look at <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/97/pn/content/ngc6369.jpg\">NGC 6369</a> indicates that the \ncentral star is closer to a dimmer edge \nof the nebula than to the opposing brighter edge.",
