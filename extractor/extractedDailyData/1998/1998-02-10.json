The robot spacecraft arrived \nlast September and continues to use solar panel \n<a href=\"ap970911.html\">aerobraking</a> to help \nmaneuver it to a better orbit to survey all of \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/mars.htm\">Mars</a>\nThe <a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/12_31_97_release/6301/index.html\">above image</a> is a reconstruction of several \nphotographs digitally combined to simulate a single \nvantage point 2700 kilometers above the Martian surface.  \nThe images were taken by the \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/moc/moc.html\">Mars Orbital Camera</a> in wide angle mode \nin late December 1997.  Visible features include the \n<a href=\"ap950720.html\">Valles Marineris</a> \ncanyon across the top, and the South <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/97/15/B.html\">Polar Cap</a> of frozen carbon dioxide at the bottom.  \nMany finer features that would normally be \nvisible are hidden by \n<a href=\"ap970804.html\">dust</a> \nremaining from a planet-wide storm that subsided \nonly three weeks before these images were recorded.",
