  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLocked in synchronous rotation,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html\">the Moon always presents</a> its\nwell-known near side to Earth.\n\nBut from lunar orbit,\n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/cover.html\">Apollo astronauts</a> also grew to\n<a href=\"http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/education/tg/teach1.html\">know the Moon's</a> far side.\n\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/a16_m_3021.html\">This sharp picture</a> from Apollo 16's mapping camera shows the eastern edge\nof the familiar near side (left) and the strange\nand heavily cratered far side\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/moon.htm\">of the Moon</a>.\n\nSurprisingly,\nthe rough and battered surface of the far side looks very different from\nthe near side which is covered with\n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/planet_volcano/lunar/mare/mlm.html\">smooth dark lunar maria</a>.\n\nThe likely explanation is that the far side crust is thicker, making\nit harder for molten material from the interior to flow to\nthe surface and form the smooth maria.",
