  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid a <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/0797issue/0797fishman.html\">gamma-ray burst</a> precede this \n<a href=\"ap970124.html\">supernova</a>?  This \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uva.nl/titus/grb980425.html\">intriguing suggestion</a> came to light <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06800/06895.html#Item1\">yesterday</a> with the discovery of an evolving supernova \nthat is <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06800/06896.html#Item1\">potentially coincident</a> with the position of \ngamma-ray burst \n<a href=\"http://fire.berkeley.edu:8080/?read=15\">GRB 980425</a>, which occurred just \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06800/06884.html#Item1\">two weeks ago</a>.  \n\nIf true, this would tie together the two most \n<a href=\"ap980507.html\">violent phenomena</a> \nknown in the universe.  The supernova, \nindicated by the arrow, appears to be somewhat unusual, \nfor one reason because of its <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06800/06896.html#Item1\">extremely bright radio emission</a>.  The \n<a href=\"ap970625.html\">host galaxy</a> \nhas a redshift of 0.0085, placing it at the relatively \nclose distance of about 125 million light years away.  \nToday it remains undetermined whether the \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9712123\">two events are related</a> - perhaps the evolution of the \n<a href=\"ap980302.html\">supernova</a> over the \nnext few weeks will provide some clues.",
