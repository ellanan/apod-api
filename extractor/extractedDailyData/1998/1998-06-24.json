  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf a star in this photograph twinkled slightly, \nwould anyone notice?  Would anyone care?  Astronomers with the \n<a href=\"http://wwwMACHO.mcmaster.ca/\">MACHO Collaboration</a> noticed one such twinkle \njust last week, and many members of the \nastronomical community now care.  \n\nThe specific type of sparkling of the \n<a href=\"ap980125.html\">SMC</a> star in the above cross-hairs\nclearly indicated a multiple-star <a href=\"http://www.hep.fsu.edu/ast3033/Micro/lensing.htm\">microlensing</a> event was in progress. \n\n<a href=\"http://thales.astro.rug.nl/~planet/lens.html\">Microlensing</a> is a rare phenomena where \ngravity itself deflects light so prominently that \nbackground sources might appear to have \n<a href=\"ap980614.html\">many images</a> and appear \n<a href=\"ap960202.html\">many times</a> their normal brightness.  \n\nStudy of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.rug.nl/~planet/index.html\">precise \ndetails</a> of the latter part of this \n<a href=\"ap950711.html\">microlensing</a> \nevent might reveal the mass and distance to the lenses.  \nWere these lenses in the outer reaches of our \n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/globs.html\">Galactic halo</a>, this would add evidence to some \ncontroversial indications that a good fraction of the normally \n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Xray/dark_matter.html\">unseen matter</a> in \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">our Galaxy</a> \nis composed of lenses only slightly less massive than \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">our Sun</a>.",
