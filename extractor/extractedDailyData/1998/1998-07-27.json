  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA very young star cluster has been \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/25/pr.html\">discovered</a> in a neighboring galaxy.  \n\nThe stars found in this cluster, dubbed N81, \nare so young and massive that they \nfuriously eject matter and light up the surrounding nebula.  \nThe ejected \n<a href=\"ap960510.html\">stellar winds</a> \ncombine and interact to sculpt \nbeautiful and complex structures.  \n\nVisible near the center of the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/25/pr-photos.html\">above representative-color picture</a> are two of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=A85-31916&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=34f6e1de7f01013\">N81</a>'s brightest stars.  Just above them lies a dark knot of \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> \nand gas where these massive stars probably originated.  \n\nThe home galaxy of this stellar nursery is the \n<a href=\"ap980125.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> \n(SMC) located about 200,000 light-years away.",
