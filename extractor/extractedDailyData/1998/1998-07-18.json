Goddard</a>, one\nof the founding fathers of modern rocketry, was\nborn in Worcester Massachusetts in 1882.\n\nAs a 16 year old, Goddard read H.G. Wells' science fiction classic\n<a href=\"http://www.literature.org/Works/H-G-Wells/war-of-the-worlds/\">\n\"War Of The Worlds\"</a> and dreamed of spaceflight.\n\nBy 1926 he had designed, built, and launched\n<a href=\"http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/service/gallery/\nfact_sheets/general/frocket/frocket.htm\"> the world's first liquid\nfuel rocket.</a>\n\nDuring his career he was ridiculed by the press\nfor suggesting that rockets could be flown to\nthe Moon, but he kept up his experiments\nin rocketry supported in part by the\n<a href=\"http://www.150.si.edu/smithexb/start.htm\">Smithsonian Institution</a> and championed by\n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/GALLERIES/GAL100/stlouis.html\">\nCharles Lindbergh.</a>\n\nPictured above in 1937 in the\ndesert near Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard\nexamines a nose cone and parachute from one of his test rockets.\nWidely recognized as a gifted experimenter and engineering genius, his\n<a href=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt\">rockets were many years ahead</a> of their time.\nHe died in 1945 holding over 200 patents in rocket technology.\n\nA liquid fuel rocket constructed on principles developed by Goddard\n<a href=\"ap970504.html\">landed humans on the Moon in 1969.</a>",
