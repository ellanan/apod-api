  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> is the second largest planet in our \n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/solarsys.htm\">Solar System</a>.  Saturn has been \n<a href=\"ap970924.html\">easily visible</a> \nin the sky since history has been recorded.  \n<a href=\"ap960830.html\">Galileo</a> used one of the \n<a href=\"http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/telescope.html\">first telescopes</a> in 1610 to discover Saturn's rings, \nwhich he first thought were moons.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/people/enlightenment/maxwell.html\">Maxwell</a> showed in 1856 that \n<a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html\">Saturn's rings</a> couldn't be a single solid, \nsince Saturn's own gravity would break it up.  \n\nWere \n<a href=\"http://ringside.arc.nasa.gov/www/saturn/saturn.html\">Saturn's rings</a> assembled into a single body, \nit would measure less than 100 kilometers across.  \n\nThe origin of \n<a href=\"ap950730.html\">Saturn's rings</a>, \nand of unusual radial patterns that appear on them called \n<a href=\"http://www.mira.org/fts0/planets/100/images/spokes2.htm\">spokes</a>, are still unknown.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.lu.se/not-images.html\">above representative-color picture</a> \nwas taken from Earth in <a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">infrared</a> light.  A robot spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/\">Cassini</a> \nlaunched in 1997 will reach \n<a href=\"ap980424.html\">Saturn</a> in 2004.",
