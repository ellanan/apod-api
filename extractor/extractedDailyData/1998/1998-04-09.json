  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere do quasars live?  \n<a href=\"ap971206.html\">Quasars</a> \nare the brightest objects in the universe, \nso bright they can be seen from across the universe.  \nObservations continue to show that most <a href=\"http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/ADASS/adass_proc/adass3/papers/wilkesb/wilkesb.html\">quasars</a> are \nsurrounded by a relatively faint nebulous patch.  \nAstronomers are trying to identify the \nnature of these <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E457%2E%2E557B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=33613e8e5810602&amp;nosetcookie=1\">patches</a>.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.roe.ac.uk/jrmwww/pics/0157.gif\">above false-color picture</a> shows a central quasar embedded in an unusual \n<a href=\"ap961106.html\">elliptical galaxy</a>.  \nThe galaxy is being \n<a href=\"ap971027.html\">gravitationally distorted</a> \nby a neighboring galaxy.\nRecent evidence indicates that most \nquasars live near the centers of large, \nelliptical galaxies - even those \n<a href=\"http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~f93-cal/Qcontents.html\">quasars</a> where no host galaxy could be found before.  \nQuasars themselves are thought to result from matter falling toward  \n<a href=\"ap970405.html\">supermassive black-holes</a>.",
