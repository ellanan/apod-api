  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBy chance, a collision of two galaxies has created a surprisingly\nrecognizable shape on a cosmic scale - \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/02.html\">\"The Cartwheel Galaxy\"</a>.\n\nThe Cartwheel is part of a group of galaxies about 500 million\nlight years away in\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Sculptor.html\">the constellation Sculptor</a>\n(two smaller galaxies in the group are visible on the right).\n\nIts rim is an\nimmense ring-like structure 100,000 light\nyears in diameter composed of newly formed,\nextremely bright, massive stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/97/34/anim.html\">When galaxies collide</a> they pass through each other,\ntheir individual stars rarely coming into contact. However,\nthe galaxies' gravitational fields are seriously\n<a href=\"ap971022.html\">distorted by the collision</a>.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/Cartwheel.txt\">the ring-like shape</a> is the result of the gravitational\ndisruption caused by a small intruder galaxy passing\nthrough a large one,\ncompressing the interstellar gas and dust and\ncausing a a star formation wave to move out from\nthe impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.\n\nIn this case the large galaxy may have originally been a spiral, not unlike\nour own Milky Way, transformed into the wheel shape by the collision.\n\nBut ...\n<a href=\"ap970224.html\">what happened to the small intruder galaxy</a>?",
