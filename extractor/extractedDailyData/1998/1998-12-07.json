  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nStar cluster RCW38 was hiding.  This \n<a href=\"ap980329.html\">open cluster</a> of stars \nis located about 5000 light years away \ntowards the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Vela.html\">Vela</a>.  \n\nLooking there will not normally reveal most of the \nstars in this cluster, though.  The reason is that the \n<a href=\"ap980803.html\">open cluster</a> is so \nyoung that it is still shrouded in thick \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> that absorbs visible light.  \n\nThis dust typically accompanies the \ngas that condenses to form \n<a href=\"ap980412.html\">young stars</a>.  \n\nWhen viewed in <a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">infrared light</a>, however, the star cluster in\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1987MNRAS.228..721M\">RCW38</a>\nis revealed, because dust is less effective at \nabsorbing infrared light.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/pr-19-98.html\">above photograph</a> was one of the first \never taken with the new \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/instruments/isaac/\">Infrared Spectrometer and Array Camera</a> (ISAAC) \naffixed to the \n<a href=\"ap960901.html\">8.2-meter Very Large Telescope</a>.",
