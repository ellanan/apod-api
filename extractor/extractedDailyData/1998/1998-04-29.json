  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nGiant spinning clouds of gas, similar to \n<a href=\"http://tqjunior.advanced.org/4232/\">Earth's tornadoes</a>, have been found on the Sun. <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Info/98/info15.html\">Solar tornadoes</a>, \nhowever, can be larger than the entire Earth, and \nsustain wind gusts over 1000 times stronger than their \nEarth counterparts.  The <a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/english/spacecraft.html\">SOHO spacecraft</a> has found that <a href=\"http://orpheus.nascom.nasa.gov/cds/home/tornado/t_caption.html\">solar tornadoes</a> start low in the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun's atmosphere</a> and spiral outwards, \ngathering speed as they enter the Solar System.  \nEarthlings have more to fear from Earth's own \nweather phenomena, though, \nbecause the high speed particles that result from \nsolar tornadoes are easily stopped by the \n<a href=\"http://www.aspire.cs.uah.edu/~jonesj/r.html\">Earth's thick atmosphere</a>.  \n\nEarthlings may have much to learn from solar tornadoes, \nincluding details of how the <a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/english/wind_and_corona.html\">solar wind and corona</a> are powered, \nand how to better predict future \n<a href=\"ap970411.html\">solar particle storms</a> \nthat could damage sensitive satellites.",
