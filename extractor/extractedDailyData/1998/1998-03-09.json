  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\" ap970711.html\">Yogi</a> is possibly the \nbest photographed rock on \n<a href=\"ap970627.html\">Mars</a>.  By combining many\npictures taken during the \n<a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Mars \nPathfinder Mission</a> last year, \nscientists were able to create a \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mpf/high-res.html\">super-resolution, digitally enhanced image</a> \nthat better allows them to study \n<a href=\"ap970716.html\">Yogi</a>'s surface \nand more <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/278/5344/1743\">accurately determine</a> how Yogi was formed.  \nThe smoothness of some Martian rocks \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mpf/papers.html\">suggests previous interactions with water</a>, \nimplying that \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a> was both warmer and \n<a href=\"ap980205.html\">wetter</a> in the past.",
