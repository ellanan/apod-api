Many scientific tests were\nperformed on Skylab, including astronomical observations in \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#uv\">ultraviolet</a> and\n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#X-ray\">X-ray</a>\nlight.  Some of these observations yielded valuable information about Comet \nKohoutek, our <a href=\"ap950813.html\">Sun</a> \nand about the mysterious X-ray background - radiation that comes from\nall over the sky. Skylab fell back to earth on 11 July 1979.",
