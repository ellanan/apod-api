  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"http://www.westegg.com/einstein/\">Albert \nEinstein</a> (1879-1955) is considered by many the greatest astrophysicist.  He is\npictured here in the Swiss Patent Office where \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/\">he</a> did much of his great work.  \n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Einstein.html\">Einstein</a>'s many visionary scientific contributions include the\nequivalence of mass and energy (E=mc^2), how the maximum speed limit of light\naffects measurements of time and space \n(<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Special_relativity.html\">special relativity</a>), and a more accurate theory of gravity based on \nsimple geometric concepts \n(<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/General_relativity.html\">general relativity</a>).  One reason \n<a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/einstein.html\">Einstein</a> \nwas awarded the 1921\n<a href=\"http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~clancey/Nobel/Nobel-Physics.html\">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> was to make the prize more prestigious.",
