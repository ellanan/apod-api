  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nLast Thursday an interplanetary spacecraft flew right past the Earth.  \nThe \n<a href=\"http://www-space.arc.nasa.gov/~leonid/news.html\">above images</a>\nshow sunlight momentarily \nreflected from this spacecraft's solar panels.  \n\nNo aliens were involved - the \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/index_old.html\">Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous</a> (NEAR) \nmission actually originated from Earth.  Launched in 1996, \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Overview/\">NEAR</a> \nzipped past the asteroid \n<a href=\"ap970630.html\">253 Mathilde</a> \nlast June.  This \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/ESB/index.html\">Earth flyby</a> gravitationally deflects NEAR onto a trajectory \npassing the asteroid 433 Eros next year.  \n\nAbove, NEAR appears to move through the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/constellation/PER.html\">Perseus</a>, as  \n<a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/intro/rossow.01/\">clouds</a> created a changing diffuse white glow.  \nNEAR was only visible for about 2 minutes from \n<a href=\"http://www.ci.san-jose.ca.us/\">San Jose</a>, California, \nwhere these image-intensified video camera observations were taken.",
