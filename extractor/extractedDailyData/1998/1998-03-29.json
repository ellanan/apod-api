  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHot <a href=\"ap971018.html \">blue stars</a> shine brightly in\nthis beautiful, recently formed galactic or \"open\" star cluster.\n\n<a href=\"index/OpenCluster.html\">Open cluster</a> NGC\n3293 is located in the constellation \n<a href=\"http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/CAR.html\">Carina</a>, \nlies at a distance of about\n8000 light years, and has a particularly high abundance of these young\nbright stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1982AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E87%2E1478H&amp;db_key=AST\">A study of NGC 3293</a> implies that the blue stars are only about 6\nmillion years old, whereas the cluster's\ndimmer, redder stars appear to be about 20\nmillion years old.  If true, star formation in this open cluster took at\nleast 15 million years. Even this amount of time \nis short, however, when\ncompared with the billions of years stars like our \n<a href=\"lib/sun.html\">Sun</a> live, and the\nover-ten billion year lifetimes of many \n<a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">galaxies</a> and our universe. <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?bibcode=1980AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E85%2E1193T&amp;page=1&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;type=GIF\">NGC 3293 appears just in front dense dust lane</a> emanating from the\n<a href=\"ap980112.html \">Carina Nebula</a>.",
