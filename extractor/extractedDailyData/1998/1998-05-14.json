  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Comets move</a> against a field of background stars.\n\nTheir apparent motion is slow but\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/eph.html\">carefull tracking</a>\nreveals their orbits, allowing these\nvisitors to the inner solar system to be identified as\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html\">old or new acquaintances</a>.\n\nRecently a new comet, designated 1998 H1,\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1998H1\">was discovered by observer Patrick L. Stonehouse</a>\nof Wolverine, Michigan, USA, and announced on April 26.\n\nAt 10th <a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a>,\ncomet Stonehouse is too faint to be seen by the unaided eye,\nbut it is\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/comets/stonehse.html\">presently a popular object</a> for\ntelescope-equipped comet watchers.\n\nThis false color picture of comet Stonehouse was\n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/stnhs.html\">taken on May 1st at Limber Observatory</a>\nand is a composite of 8 exposures each 60 seconds long.\n\nThe sequence of exposures was made with\n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/scope.html\">the telescope</a> following the background stars.\n\nThe individual pictures were then aligned on the comet and\nadded together.\n\nBecause of the comet's relative motion,\nthe combined multiple-exposure shows\n<a href=\"ap961201.html\">trails</a> of progressively offset\nstar images but nicely captures the comet's\n<a href=\"ap980410.html\">coma</a> and faint, tenuous tail.",
