  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSome galaxies are hard to find.  \nBesides being hidden behind the \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> and \n<a href=\"ap980802.html\">bright foreground \nstars</a> of our \n<a href=\"ap980523.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, \nrecently discovered \n<a href=\"http://www.nmsu.edu/~ucomm/Releases/galaxy2.html\">Cepheus 1</a> was missed previously \nbecause it is so uniformly dim.  \n\nIn fact, the first indication that any galaxy \nwas there at all came in the <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">radio band</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.nfra.nl/reduce/dwingeloo/Text_for_titus/texinfo/html/dwingeloo_toc.html\">Dwingeloo radio telescope</a> in the Netherlands.  \n\nClose inspections of optical photographs like the \n<a href=\"http://charon.nmsu.edu/cepheus1.html\">one above</a> then revealed Cepheus 1 as the \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/sb2.html\">low-surface brightness galaxy</a> in the center. \n\nCepheus 1 turns out to be only about \n20 million light years distant, \nand so is one of the few \n<a href=\"ap980525.html\">spiral galaxies</a> \nthat live close by.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.ucolick.org/~anthonyg/work/clusters.html\">Low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies</a> \nlike Cepheus 1 are still being studied, but are known\nto have relatively large separations \nbetween bright stars, and to be more commonly \nfound away from other galaxies.",
