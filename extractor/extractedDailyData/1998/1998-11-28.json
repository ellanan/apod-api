  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHow massive can a star get without imploding into a black hole?  \n\nThese limits are being tested by the discovery of a lone\n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/nstar.html\">neutron star</a> in space.\n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/32.html\">Observations</a> by the Hubble Space Telescope \nhave been combined with previous observations by the \n<a href=\"ap961008.html\">X-ray</a>\n<a href=\"http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/rosat.html\">ROSAT</a> observatory and \n<a href=\"ap960610.html\">ultraviolet</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~pubinfo/html/EUVE.html\">EUVE</a> \nobservatory for the isolated star at the location of the arrow. \n\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9811326\">Astronomers are able</a> to directly infer the star's size from\nmeasurements of its unblended brightness, temperature, and an upper\nlimit on the distance.\n\nAssuming that the object is a \nneutron star of typical mass, \nsome previous theories of neutron star structure would have predicted \nan implosion that would have\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">created a black hole</a>.\n\nThat this <a href=\"ap980425.html\">neutron star</a> \neven exists therefore allows a window to the extreme \nconditions that exist in the interiors of neutron stars.",
