  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is going on in <a href=\"ap970228.html\">NGC 891</a>?  \nThis galaxy appeared previously \nto be very similar to our own \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>: a <a href=\"ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">spiral galaxy</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/eon0.html\">seen nearly edge-on</a>.  \nHowever, recent high-resolution images of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n0891.html\">NGC 891</a>'s dust show unusual filamentary patterns \nextending well away from its Galactic disk.  This \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">interstellar dust</a> \nwas probably thrown out of the galactic disk toward the <a href=\"http://www.bc.kern.cc.ca.us/programs/sea/Astronomy/milkyway.description/milkyway.description.html\">halo</a> by \n<a href=\"ap980217.html\">stellar supernovae explosions</a>.  \nBecause dust is so fragile, its appearance after \nsurviving disk expulsion can be very <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~howk/Papers/N891/n891.html\">telling</a>.  Newly discovered phenomena, however, sometimes \n<a href=\"ap980310.html\">appear so complex</a> that more \nquestions are raised than are answered.",
