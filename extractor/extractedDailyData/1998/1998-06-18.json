  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/topics/snr_group\n/cosmic_rays.html\">Cosmic Rays</a>\nare celestial high energy particles traveling\nat nearly the speed of light, which constantly bombard the Earth.\n\n<a href=\"ap961016.html\">Discovered during</a>\nhigh altitude balloon flights in 1912\ntheir source has been a long standing mystery.\n\n<a href=\"ftp://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/pao/releases/1998/98-083.htm\">But a recent theory suggests</a> that\ncosmic ray particles are\n<a href=\"http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/periodic.html\">atomic nuclei</a> blasted from dust grains\nformed in supernovae, the death explosions of massive stars.\n\n<a href=\"FTP://PAO.GSFC.NASA.GOV/newsmedia/CRT/EJECTA.TXT\">This artist's illustration shows</a> a supernova explosion\n(at left) and a conical\nsection of the expanding cloud\n<a href=\"FTP://PAO.GSFC.NASA.GOV/newsmedia/CRT/EJECTA_TXT.JPG\">of ejected material</a>.\n\nAtoms are torn from the brownish bands of\n<a href=\"ap980104.html\"> \"dust\" </a>\nmaterial by shock waves (represented by orange rings).\n\n<a href=\"ap980217.html\">The shocks in the expanding blast wave</a>\nthen accelerate the atoms\nto near light speeds firing them into interstellar space like\ncosmic bullets.\n\nThe theory is supported by observations indicating\nthat high velocity dust was formed in\n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/StarDeath/sn1987a.html\">the nearby supernova 1987A</a>,\nand that Beryllium, a light element created in\nCosmic Ray collisions, is found equally in both old an young stars.\n\nNASA's\n<a href=\"http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/\">Advanced Composition Explorer</a> (ACE) satellite can also test details of\nthe theory by directly measuring Cosmic Rays.",
