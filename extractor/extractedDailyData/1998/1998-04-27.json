  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow can a round star make a square nebula?  This conundrum came to light with the discovery of \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/feb22/feb22.html\">planetary nebulae</a> like IC 4406.  \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/rbc/IC4406.html\">IC 4406</a> is most probably cylindrical, \nwith its square appearance the result of our \nvantage point in viewing the cylinder.  \n\nHot gas is <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1991A%26A%2E%2E%2E251%2E%2E560S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=33613e8e5801093&amp;nosetcookie=1\">known</a> to be flowing out the ends of the cylinder, while filaments of dark \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> and \n<a href=\"ap970430.html\">molecular gas</a> \nlace the bounding walls.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/jalex/PNN_paper/GW_paper2.html\">star primarily responsible</a> for this interstellar sculpture can be found in the nebula's center.  In a few million years, the only thing left visible in \n<a href=\"http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/cgi-bin/zhang/webpn?IC4406\">IC 4406</a> will be a fading \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf star</a>.",
