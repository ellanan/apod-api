This immense \n<a href=\"http://www.hurricanehunters.com/georges.htm\">storm system</a>, larger than most states, \nis expected to make landfall today.  \n\nStarting as a slight pressure difference, \n<a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqHED.html\">hurricanes</a> grow into large spiraling storm systems \nof low pressure, complete with high winds and driving rain.  \nA <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">hurricane</a> is powered by evaporating ocean water, \nand so typically gains strength over warm water and \nloses strength over land.\n\nCurrently offshore in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricanes \n<a href=\"http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/tropic/real-time/atlantic/storm/storm2.html\">Ivan</a>, \n<a href=\"http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/tropic/real-time/atlantic/storm/storm3.html\">Jeanne</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/tropic/real-time/atlantic/storm/storm4.html\">Karl</a> swirl, but will likely stay well away from \nNorth America.",
