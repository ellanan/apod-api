  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid a pond once exist in this Martian crater?  <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars/global_surveyor/camera/images/5_27_98_agu_release/index.html\">Recent photographs</a> by the spacecraft <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/movpics/mgs_vrml/mgs_vrml.html\">Mars Global Surveyor</a>, currently in orbit around \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a>, show features unusual for \n<a href=\"http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/Exo_Strat/Docs/state.html\">Mars</a> yet similar to a dried pond on \n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/vplanet.html\">Earth</a>.  \n\nPreviously, much evidence suggested the effects of \n<a href=\"ap980205.html\">ancient channels</a> \nof flowing water on Mars, but less evidence \nhad been found for \n<a href=\"ap971211.html\">dried pools of water</a>.  \nIslands and bays on this \n<a href=\"ap980430.html\">crater</a> floor indicate \nan accumulation of some liquid, however, a hypothesis \nconsistent with channels found on the (inset) \ncrater walls.   \n\nAs it is also possible the features were \nformed by other mechanisms including \n<a href=\"ap970915.html\">flowing lava</a>, \nfuture observations and analysis will be needed to \nsay for sure.",
