  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere is the rest of the circle?  <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>'s largest moon \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/ganymede.htm\">Ganymede</a> has some truly unusual terrain, \nincluding the <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/ganymede/PIA01087.html\">pictured half circle above</a> cut by nearly parallel curves.  \n\nFull circles can be easily explained by \n<a href=\"ap971117.html\">impact craters</a>, \nbut partial circles imply that some <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/ganymede/PIA01089.html\">resurfacing</a> has \noccurred since the original impact.  \nThe diameter of the half circle is about 32 kilometers.  \n\nAlso of interest is a dense linear\n<a href=\"ap950715.html\">crater chain</a> \nthat cuts across the top of the half-circle.  \nMysteries like these are typically solved by the \nhard work of reconstructing a sequence of natural occurrences, \nwhich in this case may yield a better understanding of \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/ganymede/\">Ganymede</a>'s interesting past.",
