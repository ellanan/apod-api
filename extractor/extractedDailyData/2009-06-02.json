  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes the mysterious spokes in Saturn's rings?\n\nVisible in the\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11452\">above image</a>\nas light ghostlike impressions, spokes were \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/astronomy-topics/saturn.html\">first discovered</a> in the mid-1970s and first photographed by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1\">Voyager spacecraft</a>\nthat buzzed by Saturn in the early 1980s.  \n\nTheir existence was unexpected.\n\nOddly, the <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html\">spokes</a> are more commonly observed when Saturn's rings are more nearly edge on to the Sun, and so were conspicuously\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005DPS....37.6111M\">absent</a> from initial images sent back by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini�Huygens\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn.  \n\nAnalyses of archived\n<a href=\"ap020831.html\">Voyager</a> images have led to the\nconclusions that the transient spokes, which may form and dissipate over a few hours, are composed of electrically charged sheets of small dust-sized particles.\n\nHypotheses for spoke creation include small meteors impacting the rings and\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006GeoRL..3321202J\">electron beams</a> from Saturnian atmospheric\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.P43B1292H\">lightning\nspraying</a> the rings.  \n\nAs Saturn approaches <a href=\"ap080922.html\">equinox</a>,\nspoke sightings like that\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11452\">pictured above</a> are becoming increasingly common, giving planetary scientists fresh images and data with which to test origin hypotheses.",
