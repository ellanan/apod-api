  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/\na-dead-stars-ghostly-glow\">Spooky</a> shapes seem to haunt this\njeweled expanse, drifting through the night in the royal constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.dibonsmith.com/cep_con.htm\">Cepheus</a>.\n\nOf course, the shapes are cosmic dust clouds faintly visible\nin dimly reflected starlight.\n\nFar from your own neighborhood on planet Earth, they lurk along the\nplane of the Milky Way at the\nedge of the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4761\">Cepheus Flare</a>\nmolecular cloud complex some 1,200 light-years away.\n\nOver 2 light-years across and brighter than the other ghostly\napparitions, vdB 141 or Sh2-136 is also known as the\n<a href=\"https://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im1060.html\">Ghost\nNebula</a>, seen at the right of the starry field of view.\n\nWithin the nebula are the telltale signs of dense cores\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/mission/213-Stars\">collapsing</a>\nin the early\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1894\">stages</a> of star formation.",
