  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Moon ever engulf Mars?\n\nYes, but only in the sense that it moves in front, which happens on \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/best-stargazing-of-2025-events-planets-moon-stars/\">rare occasions</a>. \n\nThis happened just yesterday, though, as seen from some locations in \n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/news/occultations/occultation_20250114_0349_visibility.png\">North America and western Africa</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20250114_16_100\">This occultation</a> was notable \nnot only because the Moon was a fully lit \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/wolf.html\">Wolf Moon</a>, but because Mars was near its largest and brightest, moving to \n<a href=\"https://spider.seds.org/spider/Mars/marsopps.html\">opposition</a> -- the closest to the Earth in its orbit -- only tomorrow. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=652639413632533\">engulfing</a>, more formally called an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation\">occultation</a>, typically lasts about an hour.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DEzq_L4RiAa/\">featured image</a> was taken from near \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DtEAYgOsM\">Chicago</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois\">Illinois</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a> just as \n<a href=\"ap240724.html\">Earth's largest satellite</a> \nwas angularly moving away from the much more distant \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/\">red planet</a>.\n\nOur   \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a> \noccasionally moves in front of all of the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>'s planets. \n\nGiven the temporary alignment of \n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/wp-content/uploads/sites/193/2020/10/Opposition_Conjunction.jpg\">orbital planes</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://astropixels.com/almanac/almanac21/almanac2025est.html\">next time</a> our \n<a href=\"ap030724.html\">Moon eclipses Mars</a> \nwill be a relatively soon February 9.",
