  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn January 21, 2019 moonwatchers on planet Earth saw a\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/lunar-phases-and-eclipses/\">total lunar eclipse</a>.\n\nIn 35 frames this composite image follows the Moon that night as\nit crossed into\n<a href=\"ap190126.html\">Earth's dark umbral shadow</a>.\n\nTaken 3 minutes apart, they almost melt together in a continuous screen\nthat captures the dark colors within the shadow itself and the northern\ncurve of the shadow's edge.\n\nSunlight scattered by the atmosphere into the shadow causes the\nlunar surface to appear reddened during totality (left),\nbut close to the umbra's edge, the limb of the eclipsed Moon shows a\n<a href=\"ap151003.html\">remarkable blue hue</a>.\n\nThe blue eclipsed moonlight originates as rays of sunlight pass through layers\nhigh in Earth's upper stratosphere, colored by ozone that scatters red light\nand transmits blue. \n\nThe Moon's next crossing into Earth's umbral shadow, will be\n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2021May26T.pdf\">on\nMay 26, 2021</a>.",
