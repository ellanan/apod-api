  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhere do spiral galaxies keep their supernovae?\n\nNear their massive star forming regions,\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/supernova.html\">of course</a>,\nand those regions tend to lie along sweeping blue spiral arms.\n\nBecause <a href=\"ap100626.html\">massive stars</a>\nare <a href=\"http://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/\nStevII.html\">very short-lived</a>, they don't\nhave a chance to wander far from their birth place.\n\nRemarkably, in the last 6 years two\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova\">Type II\nsupernovae</a>, representing\nthe death explosions of massive stars, have been detected in\n<a href=\"\">nearby spiral M51</a>.\n\nAlong with a third supernova seen in 1994,\nthat amounts to a supernova <a href=\"ap110101.html\">bonanza</a>\nfor a single galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\nsmall_supernova_comparison_ngc5194.html\">As demonstrated in these</a>\ncomparison images, SN2005cs, the supernova discovered in 2005,\nand more <a href=\"ap110605.html\">recently SN2011dh</a>,\nthe exceptionally bright supernova first recorded just last month,\nboth lie along M51's grand spiral arms.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/\nm051_rosse.html\">Perhaps the original</a> spiral nebula, M51\nis also known as <a href=\"ap080105.html\">the Whirlpool Galaxy</a>.",
