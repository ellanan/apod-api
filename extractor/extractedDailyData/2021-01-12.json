  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe night sky is filled with stories.\n\nCultures throughout history have projected \nsome of their most enduring legends onto the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> above.\n\nGenerations of people see these stellar constellations, \nhear the associated stories, and pass them down.\n\nFeatured here is the perhaps \n<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43392390\">unfamiliar constellation</a> \nof the Old Man, long recognized by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupi_people\">Tupi peoples</a> \nnative to regions of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America\">South America</a> now known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil\">Brazil</a>. \n\nThe Old Man, in more modern vernacular, may be composed of the \n<a href=\"ap191206.html\">Hyades star cluster</a> as his head and the \n<a href=\"ap161204.html\">belt of Orion</a> as part of one leg. \n\nTupi <a href=\"https://stephaniechauvin.com/therheaconstellation\">folklore</a> relates that the other leg was cut off by his unhappy wife, \ncausing it to end at the orange star now known as \n<a href=\"ap200101.html\">Betelgeuse</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap190901.html\">Pleiades star cluster</a>, on the far left, \ncan be interpreted as a head feather.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CJmcT3WFshc/\">featured image</a>, the hobbled Old Man is mirrored by a person posing in the foreground. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/\">Folklore of the night sky</a> \nis important for many reasons, including that it records \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage\">cultural heritage</a> and documents the universality of \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">human</a> intelligence and imagination.",
