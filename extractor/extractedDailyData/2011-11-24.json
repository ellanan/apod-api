  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn this\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1143b/\">artist's\nillustration</a>, two distant galaxies formed about\n2 billion years after the big bang are\ncaught in the\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4642\">afterglow of GRB090323</a>,\na gamma-ray burst seen <a href=\"ap080328.html\">across the Universe</a>.\n\nShining through its own <a href=\"ap020228.html\">host galaxy</a>\nand another nearby galaxy,\nthe alignment of gamma-ray burst and galaxies\nwas inferred from the afterglow spectrum following the burst's\ninitial detection by the\n<a href=\"http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Fermi Gamma Ray Space\nTelescope</a> in March of 2009.\n\nAs seen by one of the European Southern Observatory's\nvery large telescope units, the spectrum\nof the burst's fading afterglow also offered a surprising result -\nthe distant galaxies are richer in heavy elements\nthan the Sun, with the\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1143/\">highest abundances\never seen in the early Universe</a>.\n\nHeavy elements that enrich mature galaxies in the local Universe\nwere made in past generations\n<a href=\"ap050813.html\">of stars</a>.\n\nSo these young galaxies have experienced a\n<a href=\"ap111006.html\">prodigious</a> rate of star\nformation and chemical evolution compared to our own Milky Way.\n\nIn the illustration, the light from  the burst site\nat the left passes successively through the galaxies to the right.\n\nSpectra illustrating dark\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/\nabsorption.html\">absorption lines</a> of the galaxies' elements\nimprinted on the afterglow light are shown as insets.\n\nOf course, <a href=\"ap110811.html\">astronomers on planet Earth</a>\nwould be about\n12 billion light-years off the right edge of the frame.",
