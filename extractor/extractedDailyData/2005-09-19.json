  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are asteroids made of? \n\n To help find out, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html\">Japan</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.jaxa.jp/about/index_e.html\">JAXA</a> space agency launched the \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/hayabusa.html\">Hayabusa mission</a> to \nrendezvous with \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/hayabusa_arrives-at-itokawa_0913.html\">asteroid Itokawa</a>.  \n\nLast week, the small robotic Hayabusa spacecraft arrived at asteroid \nItokawa and stationed itself only 20 kilometers away.  \n\nAlthough a long term goal is to find out how much ice, rock and trace \nelements reside on the asteroid's surface, a shorter term  goal is to \ndetermine the mass of the asteroid by measuring the attraction of the drifting \n<a href=\"http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/enterp/missions/hayabusa/index.shtml\">Hayabusa spacecraft</a>.  \n\nDuring the next few months, \n<a href=\"http://space.com/scienceastronomy/050915_hayabusa_update.html\">Hayabusa will</a> also image and map asteroid Itokawa as it orbits the Sun.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/enterp/missions/hayabusa/today.shtml\">above time-lapse image sequence</a> was taken by Hayabusa upon final approach, \nshowing the general oblong shape of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>.   \n\nIn November, a small coffee-can sized robot dubbed \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/hayabusa.html\">MINERVA is scheduled for release</a> and is expected to hop around the asteroid taking pictures.  \n\nAlso in November, <a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news143.html\">Hayabusa</a> will fire pellets into \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25143_Itokawa\">asteroid Itokawa</a> \nand collect some of the debris in a return capsule.  \n\nIn December, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa\">Hayabusa</a> \nwill fire its rockets toward Earth and drop the \n<a href=\"ap040914.html\">return capsule</a> to Earth in 2007 June.",
