  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe large Martian crater above just left of center: \nis this a fresh crater, a degraded crater, or a ghost crater?  \n\nComplex image recognition tasks like these are currently \ndone more reliably by a human than a computer.  \n\nAdditionally, there are so many \n<a href=\"ap960919.html\">craters</a> on \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a> that \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> just doesn't \nhave enough people to classify them all!  \n\nTherefore, you can help humanity's \nunderstanding of the surface of \n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a> by volunteering to classify \n<a href=\"ap001201.html\">craters</a>.  \n\nAll you need for \n<a href=\"http://clickworkers.arc.nasa.gov/top\">this pilot study</a> \nis a proper web browser and a mouse.  \n\nIf asked to \n<a href=\"http://clickworkers.arc.nasa.gov/basic-crater-classification?\">classify</a> the above crater, you might best respond that it appears relatively fresh, as it exhibits a sharp rim and a well-preserved interior.  \n\n<a href=\"http://clickworkers.arc.nasa.gov/training/how-craters-age.html\">Degraded craters</a> are typically older and \nhave their rims more rounded, while \n\"ghost craters\" are the oldest of all and only faintly discernable.",
