  "explanation": "Scroll right to see a breathtaking panorama of Mars from the top of Husband Hill. The image was taken by the robotic rover Spirit now exploring the red planet. Spirit, situated in expansive Gusev Crater, has been exploring the Columbia Hills for some time including climbing Husband Hill over the last few months. On the way up, Spirit took in a color vista from Larry's Lookout. Visible in the above image is the vast eastern landscape previously blocked from view by the Columbia Hills themselves. The horizon is mostly defined by the rim of Thira crater visible some 15 kilometers in the distance. Spirit will now examine rocks and soil at the top of Husband Hill, looking for clues as to how the hills and local rocks formed in the distant past.",
