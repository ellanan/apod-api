  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat has created this huge empty volume in the universe?  \n\nNo one is yet sure, and even the extent of the estimated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_and_Billions:_Thoughts_on_Life_and_Death_at_the_End_of_the_Millennium\">billion</a>-<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light year</a> \nvoid is being researched.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/boom/bel.html\">void</a> \nis not a hole in space like a \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a>, \nbut rather a vast region of the universe that appears to be mostly devoid of \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni/uni_101matter.html\">normal matter</a> \nand even <a href=\"http://astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/darkmatter/dm.html\">dark matter</a>.  \n\nThe void is still thought to contain \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a>, \nthough, and is clearly traversable by light.   \n\n\nThe void's existence is \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0908\">being postulated</a> \nfollowing scientific curiosity about how unusually cold spots came to appear on \n<a href=\"ap050925.html\">WMAP's map</a> of \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni/uni_101bbtest3.html\">cosmic \nmicrowave background</a> (CMB) radiation.   \n\nOne possibility was that this CMB region was not actually \n<a href=\"http://i.pbase.com/u11/scherrer/large/39280661.DSCF7005_w.jpg\">very cold</a> but light from the spot somehow became more\n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/cosmological_redshift.html\">cosmologically redshift</a>ed than normal along the way. \n\nOther <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_%28astronomy%29\">voids</a> \nin the universe are known to exist, \nbut this void appears to have an unusually large gravitational effect, \nand so might possibly be the largest in our entire visible universe.   \n\nInvestigating this, a recent study found an unusually low number of \n<a href=\"http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/\">cosmic radio sources</a> \nbetween Earth and the CMB cold spot, which led to the inference of this giant void.  \n\nAn <a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2007/coldspot/graphics.shtml\">artist's depiction</a> \nof the huge cosmic void is \n<a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2007/coldspot/index.shtml\">shown above</a>.",
