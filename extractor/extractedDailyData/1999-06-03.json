  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhile hunting through\n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/sdss.html\">Sloan Sky Survey</a>\ndata in search of\n<a href=\"ap981211.html\">distant quasars</a>,\nPrinceton astronomers Xiaohui Fan and Michael Strauss came\nupon an undiscovered type of object very nearby - now dubbed\n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/19990531.dwarf.html\">a methane dwarf</a>.\n\nMarked by white lines in\n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/19990531.dwarf.img1.html\">this recently released image</a>, the isolated,\nfaint, but extremely red methane dwarf lies only 30 or so light-years\naway in the constellation Ophiuchus.\n\nIntermediate in size between\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/background-text/brdwarfs.txt\">a star and a planet</a>, it is thought to be\nabout 10 to 70 times as massive as Jupiter.\n\nThe moniker \"methane dwarf\" was derived from the strong signature of\nmethane gas in\n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/19990531.dwarf.img3.html\">the object's spectrum</a>.\n\nAlong with the red color, the presence of\n<a href=\"http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/methane/methane.html\">methane (CH4)</a> indicates\nthat this object is cool - cooler\n<a href=\"ap990324.html\">than brown dwarfs</a>\nwhich lack the strong methane signature\nyet are the only other known objects\n<a href=\"http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/97articles/martin.html\">in this mass range</a>.\n\nSubsequent observations have now raised the total to three detected\nmethane dwarfs, but because they are so difficult to find\nso far no one knows if they are rare or common in our Galaxy.",
