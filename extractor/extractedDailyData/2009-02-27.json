  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/\n35992534.html\">Tracking through</a>\nthe constellation Leo on February 23rd,\nbright planet Saturn and\n<a href=\"ap090225.html\">Comet Lulin</a>\nwere both near\n<a href=\"ap080718.html\">opposition</a> -- opposite the Sun in\nplanet Earth's sky.\n\nThey also passed within only 2 degrees of each other\ncreating a dramatic\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/\ngallery_lulin_page15.htm\">celestial photo-op</a>.\n\nComet Lulin was near its closest approach to planet Earth at\nthe time, at a distance of some 61 million kilometers, but\n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2007+N3&amp;orb=1\">was\norbiting</a> in the opposite direction.\n\nAs a result it swept remarkably rapidly\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhBfsgsZpU\">across the\nbackground</a> of stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOW_DIG/096.HTM\">This telephoto\nimage</a> captures both bright Saturn and greenish\nLulin in the same field in a scene not too different from\nbinocular views.\n\nDon't recognize\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/\n19feb_quadrupletransit.htm\">ringed Saturn</a>?\n\nThe rings are presently tilted nearly edge-on to our\nview and the brighter planet is overexposed to record details\nof the fainter comet.\n\nAt the upper right, Saturn is marked by multiple diffraction\nspikes created by the aperture blades in the telephoto lens.",
