  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is that strange arc?\n\nWhile imaging the cluster of galaxies Abell 370, astronomers had noted an unusual arc to the right of many cluster galaxies.  \n\nAlthough curious, one\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Mellier/Mellier1.html\">initial response</a> was to avoid commenting on the arc because nothing like it had ever been noted before.  \n\nIn the mid-1980s, however, better images allowed astronomers to\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1986BAAS...18R1014L\">identify the arc</a> as a  prototype of a new kind of astrophysical phenomenon --\nthe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens\">gravitational lens</a>\neffect of entire <a href=\"ap060321.html\">cluster of galaxies</a>\non background galaxies.\n\nToday, we know that this arc actually consists of\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26A...347...21B\">two distorted images</a> of a fairly normal galaxy that\nhappened to lie far behind the huge cluster.  \n\nAbell 370's gravity caused the background galaxies' light -- and others -- to\nspread out and come to the observer along\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkBNf_nFuhM\">multiple paths</a>, not unlike a distant light appears through the stem of a\n<a href=\"http://wela.astro.ulg.ac.be/themes/extragal/gravlens/bibdat/engl/DE/didac.html\">wine glass</a>.\n\nIn mid-July, astronomers used the\n<a href=\"ap090520.html\">just-upgraded Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nto image Abell 370 and its gravitational lens images in unprecedented detail.  \n\nAlmost all of the yellow images\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/25/image/ao/\">pictured above</a> are galaxies in the Abell 370 cluster.\n\nAn astute eye can pick up many\n<a href=\"ap080210.html\">strange arcs</a> and\n<a href=\"ap090823.html\">distorted arclets</a>, however,\nthat are actually images of more distant galaxies.\n\nStudying <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_370\">Abell 370</a>\nand its images gives astronomers a unique window into the distribution of normal and\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter\">dark matter</a> in\n<a href=\"ap070516.html\">galaxy clusters</a> and the universe.",
