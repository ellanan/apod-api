  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow hard is it to land safely on Mars?\n\nSo hard that many \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-exploration/missions/historical-log/\">more attempts have failed</a> than succeeded. \n\nThe next attempt will be on Thursday.\n\nThe main problem is that the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars\">Martian atmosphere</a> is too thick to ignore -- or it will \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/lSoWxG30rb0\">melt</a> your spacecraft. \n\nOn the other hand, the atmosphere is too thin to rely on \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qg6xxRZWnI4\">parachutes</a> -- \nor your spacecraft will crash land. \n\nTherefore, as outlined in the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/M4tdMR5HLtg\">featured video</a>, \nthe Perseverance lander will lose much of its high speed by deploying a huge parachute, but then switch to rockets, and finally, assuming everything goes right, culminate with a hovering \n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/space-images/curiositys-skycrane-maneuver\">Sky Crane</a> that will slowly lower the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/\">car-sized Perseverance rover</a> to the surface with ropes. \n\nIt may sound crazy, but the \n<a href=\"ap191029.html\">Curiosity rover</a> was \n<a href=\"ap120731.html\">placed on Mars</a> using a similar method in 2012. \n\nFrom atmospheric entry to surface touch-down takes about seven minutes, \nall coordinated by an onboard computer because \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/\">Mars</a> is too far away for rapid interactive communication. \n\nDuring this time, \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">humans</a> on \n<a href=\"ap190825.html\">Earth</a> will \n<a href=\"https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/7845/kitten-hiding-page-image.jpg\">simply wait</a> to hear if the landing was successful.\n\nLast week, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates\">UAE</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Mars_Mission\">Hope spacecraft</a> \nsuccessfully began orbiting Mars, followed a day later by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">Chinese</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianwen-1\">Tianwen-1 mission</a>, \nwhich will likely schedule a landing of its own rover sometime in the next few months.",
