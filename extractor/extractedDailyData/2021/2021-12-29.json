  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat and where are these large ovals?\n\nThey are rotating storm clouds on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> imaged last month by NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html\">Juno spacecraft</a>.\n\nIn general, higher clouds are lighter in color, and the lightest \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter\">clouds</a> visible are the relatively small clouds that dot the lower oval.\n\nAt 50 kilometers across, however, even these light clouds are not small. \n\nThey are so high up that they cast shadows on the swirling oval below.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25031\">featured image</a> has been processed to enhance color and contrast.\n\n<a href=\"ap170228.html\">Large oval</a>s are usually regions of \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146392/a-textbook-weather-front\">high pressure</a> that span over 1000 kilometers and can last for years.\n\nThe largest oval on \n<a href=\"ap211026.html\">Jupiter</a> is the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot\">Great Red Spot</a> (not pictured), which has lasted for at least hundreds of years.\n\nStudying <a href=\"https://wnmu.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/npls12.sci.ess.watcyc.jupstorms/storms-on-jupiter-nasa-planetary-sciences/\">cloud dynamics</a> on Jupiter with Juno images enables a \n<a href=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/10/11/19/51/cat-5646889__340.jpg\">better understanding</a> of dangerous \n<a href=\"ap171127.html\">typhoons and hurricanes</a> on Earth.",
