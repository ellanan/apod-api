E. Barnard</a>,\nthe obscuring interstellar dust clouds seen toward the right\n<a href=\"https://www.saguaroastro.org/the-best-of-barnards-dark-nebulae/\">include B59, B72, B77 and B78</a>,\npart of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex a mere 450 light-years away.\n\nTo the eye their combined shape\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images\">suggests a pipe</a>\nstem and bowl, and so the dark nebula's popular name is\n<a href=\"ap200807.html\">the Pipe Nebula</a>.\n\nThree bright nebulae gathered on the left are\nstellar nurseries some 5,000 light-years distant toward\nthe constellation Sagittarius.\n\nIn the 18th century astronomer\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/new-hubble-gallery-features-objects-from-popular-not-a-comet-messier-catalog\">Charles Messier included</a>\ntwo of them in his catalog of bright clusters and nebulae; M8, the\n<a href=\"ap210426.html\">largest of the triplet</a>,\nand colorful M20 just above.\n\nThe third prominent emission region includes NGC 6559 at the far left.\n\nItself divided by obscuring dust lanes, M20 is also known as\n<a href=\"ap210812.html\">the Trifid</a>.\n\nM8's popular moniker is\n<a href=\"ap160909.html\">the Lagoon Nebula</a>.",
