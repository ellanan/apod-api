  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe first identified  compact galaxy group,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9802328\">Stephan's Quintet</a>\nis featured in\n<a href=\"http://azstarman.net/CDK/HUBBLE_NGC7318.htm\">this eye-catching image</a>\nconstructed with data drawn from\nthe extensive <a href=\"http://hla.stsci.edu/\">Hubble Legacy Archive</a>.\n\nAbout 300 million light-years away, only four of these five galaxies\nare actually locked in a cosmic dance\nof repeated close encounters.\n\nThe odd man out is easy to spot, though.\n\nThe interacting galaxies,\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2009/25/2606-Image.html?news=true\">NGC 7319, 7318A, 7318B, and 7317</a>\nhave an overall yellowish cast.\n\nThey also tend to have distorted\n<a href=\"ap090426.html\">loops and tails</a>, grown under the\ninfluence of disruptive <a href=\"ap081115.html\">gravitational tides</a>.\n\nBut the predominantly bluish galaxy, NGC 7320,\nis closer, just 40 million light-years distant,\nand isn't part of the interacting group.\n\nStephan's Quintet lies within the boundaries of the high flying\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/peg/index.html\">constellation Pegasus</a>.\n\nAt the estimated distance of the quartet of interacting galaxies,\nthis field of view spans about 500,000 light-years.\n\nBut moving just beyond this field, up and to the right,\nastronomers can identify another galaxy,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7320c#/media/File:StephansQuintettIlustrated2.gif\">NGC 7320C</a>, that is also 300 million\nlight-years distant.\n\nIncluding it would bring the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/stephan/index.html\">interacting quartet back up to quintet status</a>.",
