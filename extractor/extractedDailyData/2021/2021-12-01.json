  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse?\n\nThe blue band is real but usually quite hard to see.\n\nThe featured <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range\">HDR</a> image of last week's lunar eclipse, however -- taken from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/E5d8KY_LU6Q\">Yancheng</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a> -- \nhas been digitally processed to equalize the \nMoon's brightness and exaggerate  \n<a href=\"ap201111.html\">the colors</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/19626/color-of-the-moon/\">gray color</a> of the bottom right is \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">the Moon</a>'s natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight.\n\nThe upper left part of the Moon is not directly lit by the Sun since it is \n<a href=\"ap210525.html\">being eclipsed</a> -- it in the \n<a href=\"ap211125.html\">Earth's shadow</a>.\n\nIt is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.\n\nThis part of the Moon is red -- and called a \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/blood-moon.html\">blood Moon</a> -- for the same reason that Earth's sunsets are red: \nbecause air scatters away \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">more blue</a> light than red.\n\nThe unusual <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/18sep_lunareclipse\">blue band</a> is different -- its color is created by sunlight that has passed high through Earth's atmosphere, where \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/hozon.htm\">red light</a> is better absorbed by ozone than \n<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/ozone-challenge-can-see-turquoise-lunar-eclipse\">blue</a>.\n\nA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/dec-4-2021-eclipse\">total eclipse of the Sun</a> will occur this weekend but, \n<a href=\"https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/05/21042210_264995290674140_8840525631411191808_n.jpg\">unfortunately</a>, totality be \n<a href=\"ap170730.html\">visible only</a> near the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica\">Earth's South Pole</a>.",
