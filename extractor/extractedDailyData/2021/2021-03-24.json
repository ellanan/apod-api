  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does so much of Jupiter's lightning occur near its poles?\n\nSimilar to \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> experiences both aurorae and lightning.\n\nDifferent from Earth, though, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/shallow-lightning-and-mushballs-reveal-ammonia-to-nasas-juno-scientists\">Jupiter's lightning</a> usually occurs near its\npoles -- while much of \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/earth/where-on-earth-does-lightning-flash-most\">Earth's lightning</a> occurs near its equator.\n\nTo help understand \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019EGUGA..2111691B/abstract\">the difference</a>, \nNASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/\">Juno spacecraft</a>, \ncurrently orbiting Jupiter, has observed numerous aurora and \n<a href=\"ap970512.html\">lightning events</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/junos-sru-captures-jupiter-lightning\">featured image</a>, taken by Juno's Stellar Reference Unit camera on 2018 May 24,\nshows Jupiter's northern \n<a href=\"ap161206.html\">auroral oval</a> and several bright dots and streaks.\n\nAn eye-catching event is shown in the right inset image -- which is a flash of\n<a href=\"https://www.space.com/38059-juno-finds-mysteries-in-jupiters-auroras.html\">Jupiter's lightning</a> -- one of the closest images of \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/jupiters-shallow-flashes\">aurora and lightning</a> ever.\n\nOn <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth\">Earth</a> \n(which is much nearer to the Sun than Jupiter), \nsunlight is bright enough to create, by itself, \nmuch stronger atmospheric heating at the equator than the poles, \ndriving <a href=\"https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/canuto_01/\">turbulence</a>, storms, and lightning.\n\nOn <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter\">Jupiter</a>, \nin contrast, atmospheric heating comes mostly from \n<a href=\"ap171214.html\">its interior</a> \n(as a remnant from its formation), \nleading to the hypothesis that more intense equatorial \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlngRTDQMAk/hqdefault.jpg\">sunlight</a>  \nreduces temperature differences between upper \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter\">atmospheric</a> levels, \nhence reducing \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/juno-solves-39-year-old-mystery-of-jupiter-lightning\">equatorial lightning-creating</a> storms.",
