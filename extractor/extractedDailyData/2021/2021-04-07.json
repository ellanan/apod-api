  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFound in far southern skies, deep within the boundaries of the\n<a href=\"https://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/dorado-constellation/\">constellation Dorado</a>,\nNGC 1947 is some 40 million light-years away.\n\nIn silhouette against starlight, obscuring lanes of cosmic dust\nthread across the peculiar galaxy's bright central regions.\n\nUnlike the rotation of stars, gas, and dust tracing the arms of\nspiral galaxies, the motions of dust and gas don't follow the motions of stars\nin NGC 1947 though.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1754\">Their more complicated</a>\ndisconnected motion suggest this galaxy's\nvisible threads of dust and gas\nmay have come from a donor galaxy, accreted by NGC 1947 during\nthe last 3 billion years or so of the peculiar galaxy's evolution.\n\nWith spiky foreground Milky Way stars and\neven more distant background galaxies scattered through the frame,\n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/potw2051a/\">this sharp Hubble image</a>\nspans about 25,000 light-years near the center of NGC 1947.",
