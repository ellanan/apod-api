  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever watched the Moon rise?\n\nThe slow rise of a nearly full moon over a clear horizon can be an impressive sight.\n\nOne impressive moonrise was imaged in early 2013 over \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sLksVCI5wBs\">Mount Victoria</a>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/5ycPoVPVtsA\">Lookout</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington\">Wellington</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a>.\n\nWith <a href=\"https://markg.com.au/2013/01/full-moon-silhouettes/\">detailed planning</a>, an \n<a href=\" https://markg.com.au/about/\">industrious astrophotographer</a> \nplaced a camera about two kilometers away and pointed it across the lookout to where \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> \nwould surely soon be making its nightly debut.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/markg/fullmoonsilhouettes\">featured single shot sequence</a> is unedited and \nshown in real time -- it is <i>not</i> a time lapse.\n\nPeople on \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8zlUhcmlsc\">Mount Victoria Lookout</a> \ncan be seen in <a href=\"ap160501.html\">silhouette</a> \nthemselves admiring the dawn of Earth's largest satellite.\n\nSeeing a <a href=\"ap190310.html\">moonrise</a> yourself is not difficult: \nit happens every day, although only half the time at night.\n\nEach day the \n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">Moon rises</a> about \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomycafe.net/FAQs/q1038x.html\">fifty minutes later</a> \nthan the previous day, with a full moon \n<a href=\"ap180624.html\">always rising</a> at sunset. \n\nThis Saturday, October 16, is \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/about/overview/\">International Observe the Moon Night</a>, \nwhere you observe a \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/moon-phases/\">first-quarter Moon</a> along with \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/\">other lunar enthusiasts</a>.",
