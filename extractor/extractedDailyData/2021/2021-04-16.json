  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/new-nasa-visualization-probes-the-light-bending-dance-of-binary-black-holes\">Light rays from accretion disks</a>\naround a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes\nmake their way through the warped space-time produced by\nextreme gravity in this stunning computer visualization.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap200825.html\">simulated accretion disks</a> have been given\ndifferent false color schemes,\nred for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole,\nand blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.\n\nThat makes it easier to track the light sources, but the choice\nalso reflects reality.\n\nHotter gas gives off light closer to the blue end of the spectrum and\nmaterial orbiting smaller black holes experiences stronger gravitational\neffects that produce higher temperatures.\n\nFor these masses, both accretion disks\n<a href=\"ap190411.html\">would actually emit</a> most of their light\nin the ultraviolet though.\n\nIn the video, distorted secondary images of the blue black hole,\nwhich show the red black hole's view of its partner,\ncan be found within the tangled skein of the red disk\nwarped by the gravity of the blue black hole in the foreground.\n\nBecause we're seeing red's view of blue while also seeing blue directly,\nthe images allow us to see both sides of blue at the same time.\n\nRed and blue light originating from both\nblack holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon ring,\nnear their event horizons.\n\nAstronomers expect that in the not-too-distant future they’ll be able to\n<a href=\"ap201104.html\">detect gravitational waves</a>,\nripples in space-time, produced when\ntwo supermassive black holes in a system much like the one\nsimulated here\n<a href=\"ap210411.html\">spiral together and merge</a>.",
