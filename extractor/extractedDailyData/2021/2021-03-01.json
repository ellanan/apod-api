  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Pelican Nebula is changing.   \n\nThe entire nebula, officially designated IC 5070, is divided from the larger \n<a href=\"ap000501.html\">North America Nebula</a> by a \n<a href=\"ap201122.html\">molecular cloud</a> filled with dark \n<a href=\"http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/interstellardust.cfm\">dust</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1jUJQyzv8M\">Pelican</a>, \nhowever, is particularly interesting because it is an unusually active mix of \n<a href=\"ap120722.html\">star formation</a> and evolving gas clouds.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/fxphu9/\">featured picture</a> \nwas processed to bring out two main colors, red and blue, with the\nred dominated by light emitted by interstellar \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\">hydrogen</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">Ultraviolet light</a> emitted by young energetic stars is slowly \ntransforming cold gas in the nebula to hot gas, \nwith the <a href=\"ap180205.html\">advancing boundary</a> \nbetween the two, known as an \n<a href=\"ap031013.html\">ionization front</a>, visible in bright red\nacross the image center.\n\nParticularly dense \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle#/media/File:Snail-front-0A.jpg\">tentacles</a> of cold gas remain.  \n\nMillions of years from now this nebula might no longer \nbe known as the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=Pelican\">Pelican</a>, \nas the <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJ...239..121B/abstract\">balance and placement of stars and gas</a> \nwill surely leave something that \n<a href=\"https://www.barkbusters.co.uk/images/articles/7a4120f095480e9f2a2ad2a165d90313.jpg\">appears completely different</a>.",
