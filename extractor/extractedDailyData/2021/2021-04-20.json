  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's the best way to explore Mars?\n\nPerhaps there is no single best way, but a newly demonstrated method shows tremendous promise: flight.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/historyofflight.html\">Powered flight</a> has the promise to search vast regions and \nscout out particularly interesting areas for more detailed investigation. \n\nYesterday, for the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight\">first time</a>, powered flight was demonstrated on \nMars by a small helicopter named \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/\">Ingenuity</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25828/first-video-of-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-in-flight/\">featured video</a>, Ingenuity is \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8912/say-cheese-on-mars-perseverances-selfie-with-ingenuity/\">first imaged</a> by the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/\">Perseverance rover</a> \nsitting quietly on the Martian surface. \n\nAfter a few seconds, \n<a href=\"ap210302.html\">Ingenuity</a>'s long rotors begin to spin, and a few seconds after that -- history is made as Ingenuity actually takes off, hovers for a few seconds, \nand then lands safely. \n\nMore tests of \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Anatomy\">Ingenuity</a>'s \nunprecedented ability are planned over the next few months. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-dragonfly-will-fly-around-titan-looking-for-origins-signs-of-life\">Flight</a> may help humanity \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/science/goals/\">better explore</a> not only Mars, \nbut \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>'s moon \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/titan/overview/\">Titan</a> \nover the next few decades.",
