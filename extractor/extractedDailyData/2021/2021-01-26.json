  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow did this strange-looking galaxy form? \n\n<a href=\"https://www.astronomynotes.com/careers/AAS-careerbrochure-2009.pdf\">Astronomers</a> turn detectives when trying to figure out \nthe cause of unusual jumbles of stars, gas, and dust like NGC 1316.\n\nInspection indicates that NGC 1316 is an enormous \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a> \nthat somehow includes dark dust lanes usually found in a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral galaxy</a>. \n\nDetailed images taken by the \n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/about/faq/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nshows details, however, that help in reconstructing the history of this \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/3e/d7/fe3ed7e7796e5cac54b9f68447ec7d82.jpg\">gigantic tangle</a>. \n\nDeep and wide images show \n<a href=\"ap170202.html\">huge collisional shells</a>, \nwhile deep central images reveal fewer \n<a href=\"ap190324.html\">globular clusters</a> of stars toward NGC 1316's interior. \n\nSuch effects are expected in galaxies that have undergone collisions or merging with other \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/galaxy/en/\">galaxies</a> in the past few billion years. \n\nThe dark knots and lanes of \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a>, prominent in the \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/za9jwh/D/\">featured image</a>, \nindicate that one or more of the devoured galaxies were spiral galaxies. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1316\">NGC 1316</a> \nspans about 50,000 light years and lies about 60 million \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hFboxodn7ZM\">toward</a> the constellation of the Furnace \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax\">Fornax</a>).",
