  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt somehow survived an explosion that would surely have destroyed our Sun.\n\nNow it is spins 30 times a second and is famous for the its rapid flashes.\n\nIt is the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Pulsar\">Crab Pulsar</a>, the rotating \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/neutron_stars.html\">neutron star</a> remnant of the supernova that created the \n<a href=\"ap200906.html\">Crab Nebula</a>.\n\nA careful eye can spot the pulsar flashes in the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4on-e614tag\">featured time-lapse video</a>, \njust above the image center.\n\nThe video was created by adding together images taken only when the pulsar was flashing, \nas well as co-added images from other relative times. \n\nThe Crab Pulsar flashes may have been \n<a href=\"https://pos.sissa.it/099/014/pdf\">first noted</a> \nby an unknown woman attending a \n<a href=\"https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/event-list.cfm\">public observing night</a> \nat the University of Chicago in 1957 -- but who was not believed. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/crab-nebula-was-an-exploding-star\">progenitor supernova explosion</a> was seen by many in the year 1054 AD. \n\nThe expanding Crab Nebula remains a \n<a href=\"ap160708.html\">picturesque</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/full/327338/0/\">expanding</a> \ngas cloud that \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yf3Jd51pnuk\">glows across</a> the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro\">electromagnetic spectrum</a>.  \n\nThe pulsar is now thought to have survived the \nsupernova explosion because it is composed of extremely-dense \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter\">quantum-degenerate matter</a>.",
