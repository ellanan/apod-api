  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFamed in festival, story, and song the best known\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/harvest-moon-2/\">full moon is the Harvest Moon</a>.\n\nFor northern hemisphere dwellers that's a traditional name of the\nfull moon nearest the September equinox.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeCohea/status/1440104436194582529/photo/1\">Seen from Saunderstown</a>,\nRhode Island, planet Earth, this\nHarvest Moon left a broad streak of warm hues as it rose through a twilight\nsky over the Newport Bridge.\n\nOn September 20 its trail was captured in a single 22 minute exposure\nusing a dense filter and a digital camera.\n\nOnly two days later the September equinox\nmarked a change of season and the beginning of autumn in the north.\n\nIn fact, recognizing a season as the time\n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2021/09/\">between solstice and equinox</a>,\nthis Harvest Moon was the\n<a href=\"ap210826.html\">fourth full moon of the season</a>,\ncoming just before the astronomical end of northern summer.",
