  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would you want to fake a universe?\n\nFor one reason -- to better understand \n<a href=\"ap210802.html\">our real universe</a>.\n\nMany \n<a href=\"https://www.desi.lbl.gov/\">astronomical project</a>s \nseeking to learn properties of our universe now start with a \n<a href=\"ap980617.html\">robotic telescope</a> \ntaking sequential images of the night sky.\n\nNext, sophisticated \n<a href=\"https://ascl.net/\">computer algorithms</a> \ncrunch these digital images to find \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-are-galaxies\">galaxies</a> and measure their properties.\n \nTo calibrate these algorithms, it is useful to test them on \n<a href=\"https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2bf/ab0/4475d06d113fb460a24eb97d81ca6a869a-lioncat.jpg\">fake images</a> from a \n<a href=\"ap200223.html\">fake universe</a> \nto see if the algorithms can correctly deduce purposely imprinted properties.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211101713S/abstract\">featured mosaic</a> of fake images was created to \nspecifically mimic the images that have appeared on \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/\">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a> \n(<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a>). \n\nOnly <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke#1980s\">one</a> image of the 225 images is real -- can you find \n<a href=\"ap200906.html\">it</a>?\n\nThe accomplished deceptors have made available individual \nfake APOD images that can be displayed by accessing their \n<a href=\"https://www.mjjsmith.com/thisisnotanapod/\">ThisIsNotAnAPOD webpage</a> \nor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThisIsNotAnApod\">Twitter feed</a>.\n\nMore useful for calibrating and understanding our \n<a href=\"https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/science/index.html\">distant universe</a>, however, are fake galaxies -- \na sampling of which can be seen at their \n<a href=\"https://www.mjjsmith.com/thisisnotagalaxy/\">ThisIsNotAGalaxy webpage</a>.",
