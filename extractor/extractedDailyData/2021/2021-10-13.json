  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt may look like a huge cosmic question mark, but the big question really is   \nhow does the bright gas and dark dust tell this nebula's history of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">star formation</a>. \n\nAt the edge of a giant\n<a href=\"ap201122.html\">molecular cloud</a> toward the northern\nconstellation Cepheus, the glowing star forming region NGC 7822 \nlies about 3,000 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a> away.\n\nWithin the nebula, bright edges and dark shapes stand out in this\ncolorful and detailed skyscape.\n\nThe 9-panel mosaic, taken over 28 nights with a small telescope in Texas,\nincludes data from \n<a href=\"ap060324.html\">narrowband</a> filters,\nmapping emission from atomic oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur into blue,\ngreen, and red hues.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line\">emission line</a> and color combination has become well-known as the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/the-meaning-of-light-and-color\">Hubble palette</a>.\n\nThe atomic emission is powered by \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">energetic radiation</a> from the central hot stars.\n\nTheir powerful winds and radiation sculpt and erode\nthe denser pillar shapes and clear out a\n<a href=\"ap150225.html\">characteristic</a> cavity light-years across\nthe center of the natal cloud.\n\nStars could still be \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/science/stars-and-nebulas\">forming</a> inside the pillars by\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/\ngravc.html#c1\">gravitational collapse</a> but as the pillars are eroded away, \nany forming stars will ultimately be cut off from their reservoir of\n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/117494/what-does-it-mean-to-be-star-stuff/\">star stuff</a>.\n\nThis field of view \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/5a/41/e95a41b46d7c2922ab0b3119e5ab6503.jpg\">spans</a> over 40 light-years across \nat the estimated distance of NGC 7822.",
