  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAre asteroids dangerous?\n\nSome are, but the likelihood of a dangerous asteroid striking the Earth during any given year is low.\n\nBecause some past mass \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event\">extinction event</a>s have been linked to asteroid impacts, however, \nhumanity has made it a priority to find and catalog those \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroidwatch/\">asteroids</a> \nthat may one day affect \n<a href=\"ap170326.html\">life on Earth</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17041\">Pictured here</a> \nare the orbits of the over 1,000 known \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentially_hazardous_object\">Potentially Hazardous</a> Asteroids (PHAs).\n\nThese documented tumbling \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Balanced_Rock.jpg\">boulders</a> \nof rock and ice are over 140 meters across and \nwill pass within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth -- \nabout 20 times the distance to the Moon.\n\nAlthough none of them will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_COcHHvte-0\">strike the Earth</a> in the next 100 years -- \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/multimedia/gallery/neowise/pia14734.html\">not all PHAs have been discovered</a>, \nand past 100 years, many orbits become hard to predict.\n\nWere an asteroid of this size to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event\">impact the Earth</a>, \nit could raise <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3AdFjklR50\">dangerous tsunamis</a>, \nfor example.\n\nTo investigate Earth-saving strategies, NASA's  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart\">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a> \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test\">DART</a>) is planned for launch later this year.\n\nOf course rocks and ice bits of much smaller size \n<a href=\"ap210131.html\">strike the Earth every day</a>, \nusually pose no danger, and sometimes creating \n<a href=\"ap130218.html\">memorable fireball</a> and \n<a href=\"ap121119.html\">meteor displays</a>.",
