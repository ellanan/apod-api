  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earth-farthest-from-the-sun-for-year-in-early-july/\">Aphelion for 2021</a> occurred on July 5th.\n\nThat's the point in Earth's elliptical orbit when it is farthest from the Sun.\n\nOf course, the distance from the Sun doesn't determine the seasons.\n\nThose are governed by\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/#orbit_and_rotation_otp\">the tilt of Earth's axis</a> of rotation,\nso July is still summer in the north and winter in the southern\nhemisphere.\n\nBut it does mean that on July 5 the Sun was at its smallest\napparent size when viewed from planet Earth.\n\nThis composite neatly compares two pictures of the Sun,\nboth taken with the same telescope and camera.\n\nThe left half was captured close to the date of the\n2021 perihelion (January 2), the closest point in Earth's orbit.\n\nThe right was recorded just before the aphelion in 2021.\n\nOtherwise difficult to notice, the change in the\nSun's apparent diameter between\n<a href=\"http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/perap2001.html\">perihelion and aphelion</a>\namounts to a little over 3 percent.",
