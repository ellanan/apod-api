  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could see, separately, all the\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/O9MvdMqKvpU?t=87\">colors of the</a> Ring?\n\nAnd of the surrounding stars?\n\nThere's technology for that.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://vanderbei.princeton.edu/images/NJP/m57.html\">featured image</a> shows the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-57-the-ring-nebula\">Ring Nebula</a> (M57) \nand nearby stars through such technology: in this case, a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism#/media/File:Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif\">prism</a>-like \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_grating\">diffraction grating</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"ap180417.html\">Ring Nebula</a> is seen only a few times \nbecause it emits light, primarily, in only a few colors.\n\nThe two brightest emitted colors are \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">red</a>) and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-perseverance-mars-rover-extracts-first-oxygen-from-red-planet\">oxygen</a> (blue), appearing as nearly overlapping images to the left of the image center. \n\nThe image just to the right of center is the \n<a href=\"ap060511.html\">color-combined icon</a> normally seen. \n\nStars, on the other hand, emit most of their light in colors all across the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible spectrum</a>. \n\nThese colors, \n<a href=\"https://s36537.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/snuggle_01.jpg.optimal.jpg\">combined</a>, make a nearly continuous streak -- \nwhich is why stars appear accompanied by multicolored bars. \n\nBreaking object light up into colors is \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/spectra1.html\">scientifically useful</a> because it can reveal the \n<a href=\"ap200809.html\">elements</a> that compose that object, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy\">how fast</a> that object is moving, and \n<a href=\"ap200920.html\">how distant</a> that object is.",
