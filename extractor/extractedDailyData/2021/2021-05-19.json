  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNormally faint and elusive, the Jellyfish Nebula is caught in\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheVastReaches/status/1390351755465084930\">this alluring</a> scene.\n\nIn the telescopic field of view two bright yellowish stars,\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/tejat.html\">Mu</a> and\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/propus.html\">Eta</a>\nGeminorum, stand just below and above the Jellyfish Nebula at the left.\n\nCool red giants, they lie at the foot of the\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/gem/index.html\">celestial\ntwin</a>.\n\nThe Jellyfish Nebula itself floats below and left of center, a bright arcing\nridge of emission with dangling tentacles.\n\nIn fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped\n<a href=\"ap060602.html\">supernova remnant IC 443</a>, the expanding\ndebris cloud from a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">massive star that exploded</a>.\n\nLight from that explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years ago.\n\nLike its cousin in\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2198\">astrophysical</a> waters the\n<a href=\"ap180317.html\">Crab Nebula</a> supernova remnant,\nthe Jellyfish Nebula is\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2000/1083/index.html\">known\nto harbor</a> a neutron star, the remnant of the collapsed stellar core.\n\nComposed on April 30, this telescopic snapshot also captures Mars.\n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/why-is-mars-sometimes-bright-and-sometimes-faint\">Now wandering</a>\nthrough early evening skies,\nthe Red Planet also shines with a yellowish glow on the\nright hand side of the field of view.\n\nOf course, the Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away, while\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/perseverance-s-robotic-arm-starts-conducting-science\">Mars is currently</a>\nalmost 18 light-minutes from Earth.",
