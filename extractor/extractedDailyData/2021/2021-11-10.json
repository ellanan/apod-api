  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMany think it is just a <a href=\"https://www.mythweb.com\">myth</a>.  \n\nOthers think it is true but its cause isn't known.  \n\nAdventurers <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/f5/d0/bff5d074d399bdfec6071e9168398406.jpg\">pride themselves</a> on having seen it.  \n\nIt's a <a href=\"http://www.exo.net/~pauld/physics/atmospheric_optics/green_flash.html\">green flash</a> from the\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>.  \n\nThe truth is the\n<a href=\"https://aty.sdsu.edu/\">green flash</a>\ndoes exist and its cause is well understood.  \n\nJust as the setting\n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> disappears completely from view,\na last glimmer appears startlingly\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green\">green</a>.  \n\nThe effect is typically visible only from locations with a low,\ndistant horizon, and lasts just a few seconds.\n\nA <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html\">green flash</a> is also visible for a rising\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18012\">Sun</a>, but takes better timing to spot.  \n\nA dramatic\n<a href=\"ap040321.html\">green flash</a> \nwas caught on video last month as the Sun set beyond the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligurian_Sea\">Ligurian Sea</a> \nfrom <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zworaQSsB-0\">Tuscany</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>.\n\nThe second sequence in the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/25FfQ9MEQE8\">featured video</a> shows the \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/gf1.htm\">green flash</a> \nin real time, while the first is sped up and the last is in \n<a href=\"ap120723.html\">slow motion</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap070129.html\">Sun</a> itself does <i> not </i> turn\npartly green -- the effect is caused by layers of the\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> acting like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersive_prism\">prism</a>.",
