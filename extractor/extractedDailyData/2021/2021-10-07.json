  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSlide your telescope just east of the Lagoon Nebula to find this\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/pxnp3i/D/\">alluring field of view</a>\nin the rich starfields of the constellation\nSagittarius toward the central Milky Way.\n\nOf course the Lagoon nebula is also known as M8, the eighth object\nlisted in\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/explore-the-night-sky-hubble-s-messier-catalog-bio\">Charles Messier's</a>\nfamous catalog of bright nebulae and star clusters.\n\n<a href=\"ap210426.html\">Close on the sky</a>\nbut slightly fainter than M8,\nthis complex of nebulae was left out of Messier's list though.\n\nIt contains obscuring dust, striking red emission\nand blue reflection nebulae of star-forming region\n<a href=\"ap090802.html\">NGC 6559</a> at right.\n\nLike M8, NGC 6559 is located about 5,000 light-years away\nalong the edge of a large molecular cloud.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4479\">At that distance</a>,\nthis telescopic frame nearly 3 full moons wide\nwould span about 130 light-years.",
