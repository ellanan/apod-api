  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus?  \n\nVast sections of\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29\">this strange world</a> are dark brown,  \nwhile others are as bright white.  \n\nThe composition of the dark material is unknown, but\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro\">spectra</a> indicate that it possibly contains some dark form of\n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml\">carbon</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://trek.nasa.gov/iapetus/\">Iapetus</a> also has an unusual\n<a href=\"ap050201.html\">equatorial ridge</a>\nthat makes it appear like a <a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=99\">walnut</a>.  \n\nTo help better understand this seemingly painted moon,\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/about/index.html\">NASA</a> directed the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_spacecraft\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn to swoop\n<a href=\"ap070919.html\">within 2,000 kilometers</a> in 2007.\n\nIapetus is \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2381/iapetus-3d-model/\">pictured here in 3D</a>. \n\nA huge impact crater seen in the south spans a tremendous 450 kilometers\nand appears superposed on an\n<a href=\"ap060530.html\">older crater</a> of similar size.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap070914.html\">dark material</a>\nis seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of\n<a href=\"ap060103.html\">Iapetus</a>, darkening craters and highlands alike.  \n\n<a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/\">Close inspection</a> indicates that the dark coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick.\n\nA <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005DPS....37.3908S/abstract\">leading hypothesis</a> is that the dark material is mostly\ndirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty ice\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)\">sublimates</a>.\n\nAn initial coating of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYvITG_TDfE\">dark material</a> may have been effectively painted \non by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from \n<a href=\"ap180514.html\">other moon</a>s.",
