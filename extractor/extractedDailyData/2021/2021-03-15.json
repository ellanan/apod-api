  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but have you ever <i> heard </i> a meteor?\n\nUsually, meteors are \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/whoosh-can-you-hear-a-meteor-streak-past\">too far away</a> to make any audible sound. \n\nHowever, a \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/overview/\">meteor</a> will briefly create an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_burst_communications\">ionization trail</a> \nthat can reflect a distant radio signal.\n\nIf the geometry is right, you may \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/aa/fd/f3aafd5b31e81165473be45d67383a33.jpg\">momentarily hear</a> -- through your radio -- \na distant radio station even over \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cosmic-radio-background/\">static</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://www.heliotown.com/Fireballs.html\">featured video</a>, \nthe sounds of distant radio transmitters were caught reflecting from \nlarge meteor trails by a sensitive radio receiver -- at the same time the \n<a href=\"ap011119.html\">bright streaks</a> were captured by an \n<a href=\"ap090817.html\">all-sky video camera</a>.\n\nIn the video, the  \n<a href=\"ap130218.html\">bright</a> \n<a href=\"ap110123.html\">paths</a> taken by four \n<a href=\"ap990219.html\">fireball</a>s across the sky near \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamy,_New_Mexico\">Lamy</a>, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/unghDml5F_4\">New Mexico</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a>, are shown first. \n\nNext, after each static frame, a real-time video captures each \n<a href=\"ap200912.html\">meteor streaking</a> \nacross the sky, now paired with the sound recorded from its radio reflection. \n\nProjecting a meteor trail down to the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> \nmay lead to finding its \n<a href=\"ap090328.html\">impact site</a> (if any), while projecting its \n<a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/meteor-hunters-track-fireballs-in-the-night-sky\">trail back</a> into the sky may lead to identifying its \n<a href=\"ap180808.html\">parent comet or asteroid</a>.",
