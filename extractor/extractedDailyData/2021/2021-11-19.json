  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nIn visible light the stars have been removed from this narrow-band image\n<a href=\"ap110825.html\">of NGC 281</a>,\na star forming region some 10,000 light-years away toward\nthe constellation Cassiopeia.\n\nStars were digitally added back to the resulting\n<a href=\"ap210827.html\">starless</a> image though.\n\nBut instead of using visible light image data, the stars were added with\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/ngc281/\">X-ray data</a>\n(in purple) from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and\n<a href=\"https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/image/sig11-014-living-the-high-life\">infrared data</a>\n(in red) from the Spitzer Space Telescope.\n\nThe merged\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro\">multiwavelength</a>\nview reveals a multitude of\nstars in the region's embedded star cluster\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15129\">IC 1590</a>.\n\nThe young stars are normally hidden in visible light images by\nthe natal cloud's gas and obscuring dust.\n\nAlso known to backyard astro-imagers as the\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man\">Pacman</a>\nNebula for its overall appearance in visible light,\nNGC 281 is about 80 light-years across.",
