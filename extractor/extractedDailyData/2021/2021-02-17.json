  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was not a typical sun pillar. \n\nJust after sunrise two weeks ago in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zJ-g6DpBsAs\">Providence</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island\">Rhode Island</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a>, a photographer, looking out his window, was suddenly awestruck.\n\nThe astonishment was caused by a \n<a href=\"ap180606.html\">sun pillar</a> that \n<a href=\"https://catsherdyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cat_fan_working_sm.jpg\">fanned out</a> at the top. \n\nSun pillars, singular columns of light going up from \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">the Sun</a>, are themselves rare to see, and are known to be caused by sunlight \n<a href=\"ap191227.html\">reflecting</a> from wobbling, \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platpill.htm\">hexagon-shaped ice-disks</a> \nfalling through \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nSeparately, upper \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/colsolat.htm\">tangent arcs</a> \nare known to be caused by sunlight refracting through falling \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/colpill.htm\">hexagon-shaped ice-tubes</a>.\n\nFinding a \n<a href=\"ap060205.html\">sun pillar</a> connected to an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_and_lower_tangent_arcs\">upper tangent arc</a> is extraordinary, and, initially, \ntook some analysis to figure out what was going on.\n\nA leading theory is that this \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/pillar.htm\">sun pillar</a> \nwas also created, in a complex and unusual way, by falling ice tubes.\n \nFew might believe that such a \n<a href=\"ap200224.html\">rare phenomenon</a> was seen again if it \nwasn't for the quick thinking of the photographer -- \nand the camera on his nearby \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone#/media/File:Sharp_J-SH04_CP+_2011.jpg\">smartphone</a>.",
