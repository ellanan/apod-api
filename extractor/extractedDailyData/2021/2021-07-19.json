  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe photographer had this shot in mind for some time.\n\nHe knew that \n<a href=\"http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys445/lectures/atmos/atmos.html\">objects overhead are the brightest</a> -- \nsince their light is \n<a href=\"https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-publications/satellite-imagery-air-photos/remote-sensing-tutorials/introduction/interactions-atmosphere/14635\">scattered</a> the least by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">atmospheric air</a>.\n\nHe also that knew the \n<a href=\"ap100831.html\">core of our Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nwas just about straight up near midnight around this time of year in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia\">South</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>. \n\nChasing his mental picture, he ventured deep inside the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Wt7fWL-gsag\">Kuipto</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuitpo_Forest\">Forest</a> where tall \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_radiata\">radiata pines</a> \nblocked out much of the sky -- but not in this clearing. \n\nThere, through a window framed by trees, \nhe captured his envisioned combination of local and distant nature.\n\nSixteen exposures of both trees and the \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> were recorded.\n\n<a href=\"ap120417.html\">Antares</a> is the bright orange star to left of \n<a href=\"ap180517.html\">our Galaxy's central plane</a>, while \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/alpha-centauri-is-the-nearest-bright-star/\">Alpha Centauri</a> is the bright star just to the right of the image center. \n\nThe direction toward our \n<a href=\"ap210602.html\">Galaxy's center</a> is below Antares. \n\nAlthough in a few hours the \n<a href=\"ap200701.html\">Earth's rotation</a> moved the \nGalactic plane up and to the left -- soon \n<a href=\"https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/poster/8/10/break/images-medium-5/embarrassed-kitty-cat-hiding-behind-tree-ella-kaye.jpg\">invisible behind the timber</a>, \nhis mental image was secured forever -- and is \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ0Mj-sjnw5/\">featured here</a>.",
