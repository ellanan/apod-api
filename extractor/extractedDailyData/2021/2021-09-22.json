  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhen does the line between night and day become vertical?\n\nToday.\n\nToday is an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">equinox</a> on planet Earth, \na time of year when day and night are most nearly equal.\n\nAt an equinox, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)\">Earth's terminator</a> -- \nthe dividing line between day and night -- becomes vertical and connects the \n<a href=\"https://climatekids.nasa.gov/polar-temperatures/\">north</a> and \n<a href=\"ap131211.html\">south</a> poles.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUW51lvIFjg\">featured time-lapse video</a> \ndemonstrates this by displaying an entire year on planet Earth in twelve seconds.\n\nFrom <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/geo_feature_prt.htm\">geosynchronous orbit</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteosat\">Meteosat 9</a> satellite recorded \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=52248\">these infrared images</a> \nof the Earth every day at the same \n<a href=\"http://time.gov/\">local time</a>. \n\nThe video started at the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/calendar/ca1009.html\">September 2010</a> \nequinox with the terminator line being vertical.\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> revolved around the Sun, the terminator was seen to tilt in a way \nthat provides less daily sunlight to the northern hemisphere, \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/\">causing winter</a> in the north.\n\nAs the year progressed, the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/calendar/ca1103.html\">March 2011</a> \nequinox arrived halfway through the video, \nfollowed by the terminator \n<a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/JOe1P4jUAhTKhPI787/giphy.gif\">tilting the other way</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/75843/why-are-there-seasons/\">causing winter</a> in the southern hemisphere -- and summer in the north.\n\nThe captured year ends again with the \n<a href=\"ap190923.html\">September equinox</a>, \nconcluding another of billions of trips the Earth has taken \n-- and will take -- around the Sun.",
