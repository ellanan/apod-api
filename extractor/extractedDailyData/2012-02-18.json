  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis rugged road through the dark Atacama Desert seems\n<a href=\"ap090613.html\">to lead skyward</a>\ntoward the bright stars and glowing nebulae of the\nsouthern Milky Way.\n\nIf you follow the road you will get to Cerro Armazones peak\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/\ngalleries.asp?Sort=Country&amp;Value=Chile&amp;page=1\">in Chile</a>,\nfuture construction site for the 40-meter class\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/\">European\nExtremely Large Telescope</a>.\n\nFor now though, sliding your cursor across the image will identify\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3003513\">wonders\nof the southern skies</a> in view.\n\nThe scene is dominated by the reddish glow of the\n<a href=\"ap110609.html\">Great Carina Nebula</a>,\none of our galaxy's largest star forming regions.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3003496\">the\nremarkable skyscape</a> is not a composite of varying\nexposures or a photomontage.\n\n<a href=\"ap110730.html\">Far from sources</a> of light pollution,\nthe landscape illuminated by starlight and the Milky Way above\nwere recorded by a modified digital camera and fast lens.\n\nThe sensitive system captured both planet Earth and deep sky in a\nrelatively <a href=\"ap060806.html\">short exposure</a>.",
