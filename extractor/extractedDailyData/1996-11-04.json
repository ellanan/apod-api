  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nAs spring comes to the northern\n<a href=\"lib/mars.html\">latitudes of Mars</a>,\nincreased solar heating brings warmth and a change in the weather.\n\nThe winds produced by the large temperature differences\nbetween the receding polar ice and\nthe warming regions to the south may cause dust\nstorms - like the one visible in\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/34.html\">the above Hubble Space Telescope images</a>\nmade in September this year.\n\nOn the left, north is up and the Martian polar cap is seen at the top with\ndark regions along its southern border.  The dust storm, about 600\nmiles wide, is visible against the white polar ice as\na salmon colored notch.\n\nThe image on the right presents the data showing the dust storm\non a map grid centered on the north pole.\n\n<a href=\"ap960808.html\">Mars is famous</a> for planet wide dust storms but studies of more localized\nweather patterns are difficult without high resolution images like those\nprovided by the Hubble.\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov:80/mars/\">As NASA prepares future missions</a> to Mars, detailed\nstudies of\n<a href=\"http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/MarsImages/MarsToday/MarsToday.html\">Martian weather patterns</a> become increasingly important.",
