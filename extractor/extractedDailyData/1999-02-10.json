  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDo the powerful explosions known as \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/0797issue/0797fishman.html\">gamma-ray bursts</a> (GRBs) originate in galaxies?  \n\nThis subject took on new light yesterday with the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/990123/\">release</a> of a \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nimage of the sky surrounding \n<a href=\"ap990125.html\">GRB 990123</a>.\n \nThis burst was \n<a href=\" http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/205.gcn3\">first detected</a> only two weeks ago and cataloged \nas one of the most \n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/224.gcn3\">powerful GRB</a>s ever.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap970513.html\">optical transient</a> \n(OT) counterpart to the GRB can be\nseen as the bright spot just below center.  \n\nOnce so bright it was briefly visible with just binoculars, \nthis OT has since become four million times dimmer \nand continues to fade.  \n\nNow, it can be seen easily with only a large telescope.  \nThe diffuse object above is\nof particular interest because it appears to be the\n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/256.gcn3\">host galaxy of GRB 990123</a>.  \n\nThis <a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/~george/grb/grb990123.html\">distant galaxy</a> seems to have a normal\nbrightness but an irregular shape.  This discovery increases the \nevidence that most OTs do occur in galaxies.  \nAre all host galaxies this strange?",
