  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYou'd think the Pacman Nebula would be eating stars, but actually it is forming them.\n\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/ngc281/\">Within\nthe nebula</a>, a cluster's young, massive stars are powering \nthe pervasive nebular glow.\n\nThe eye-catching shapes looming in the featured \nportrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule\">Bok globules</a>\nseen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">radiation</a>\nfrom the hot cluster stars.\n\nIf they survive long enough, the \n<a href=\"ap220925.html\">dusty structure</a>s could also be sites of future star formation.\n\n<a href=\"https://pethelpful.com/.image/w_828,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_4:3,g_xy_center,x_564,y_256/NDowMDAwMDAwMDAwMDcwNTY0/catplaypiano-70564-70564-70564-70564-70564-70564-70564.jpg\">Playfully</a> called the\n<a href=\"https://doodles.google/doodle/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man/\">Pacman</a> Nebula because of its overall shape,\nNGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/\">Cassiopeia</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://lasi2.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/pin-under-microscope/\">sharp</a> composite image was \n<a href=\"https://www.aaeivissa.com/telescopio-cala-dhort/\">made</a> through\n<a href=\"ap071102.html\">narrow-band</a> filters in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a> in mid 2024.\n\nIt combines emissions from the nebula's hydrogen \nand oxygen atoms to \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/the-meaning-of-light-and-color\">synthesize</a> red, green, and blue colors.\n\nThe scene spans well over 80 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-years</a> at the estimated distance of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_281\">NGC 281</a>.",
