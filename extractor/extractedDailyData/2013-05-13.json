  "title": "Partial Solar Eclipse with Airplane",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was just eight minutes after sunrise, last week, and already there were four things in front of the Sun.\n\nThe largest and most notable was Earth's Moon, obscuring a big chunk of the Sun's lower limb as it moved across the solar disk, as viewed from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle,_Australia\">Fremantle</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>.\n\nThis was expected as the image was taken during a partial \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2013May10Agoogle.html\">solar eclipse</a> -- an eclipse that left sunlight streaming around \n<a href=\"ap130511.html\">all sides of the Moon</a> from \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEanimate/SEanimate2001/SE2013May10A.GIF\">some locations</a>.\n\nNext, a <a href=\"ap100623.html\">band</a> of clouds divided the \nSun horizontally while showing interesting internal \n<a href=\"https://spark.ucar.edu/shortcontent/troposphere-overview\">structure vertically</a>. \n\nThe third intervening body might be considered to be the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, \nas it dimmed the Sun from its higher altitude brightness while density fluctuations caused the \n<a href=\"ap110104.html\">Sun's edges</a> to appear to shimmer.\n\nAlthough closest to the photographer, the least expected \n<a href=\"ap120611.html\">solar occulter</a> was an airplane.\n\nQuite possibly, passengers on both sides of that airplane were \n<a href=\"ap120528.html\">contemplating</a> \nthe unusual view only visible out the eastern-facing windows.",
