  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLike most other sungrazing comets, Comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3)\nwas not expected to survive its\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/\n16dec_cometlovejoy/\">close encounter with the Sun</a>.\n\nBut it did.\n\nThis image\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/pickoftheweek/\nold/03dec2011/\">from a coronograph</a>\nonboard the sun-staring SOHO spacecraft identifies the still\n<a href=\"http://sungrazer.nrl.navy.mil/\nindex.php?p=news/birthday_comet_c1\">inbound</a>\nremnants of the tail, with the brilliant head or coma\n<a href=\"http://sungrazer.nrl.navy.mil/\nindex.php?p=news/birthday_comet\">emerging from</a>\nthe solar glare on December 16. \n\nThe Sun's position, behind an occulting disk to block the overwhelming\nglare, is indicated by the white circle.\n\nSeparated from its tail, Comet Lovejoy's coma is so bright it saturates\nthe camera's pixels creating the horizontal streaks.\n\nBased on their orbits, <a href=\"ap090322.html\">sungrazer comets</a>\nare thought to belong to the Kreutz\nfamily of comets, created by successive break ups from a single large\nparent comet that passed very near the Sun in the twelfth century. \n\nMost have been discovered with SOHO's cameras,\nbut unlike many sungrazers, this one was first spotted by Australian\n<a href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/comets-ml/\nmessage/18445\">astronomer Terry Lovejoy</a> from an earth-based observatory.\n\nComet Lovejoy is estimated to have come within 120,000 kilometers\nof the Sun's surface and <i>likely had</i>\na large cometary nucleus to have survived its intense\n<a href=\"http://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/\nmechanics/orbit/perihelion_aphelion.html\">perihelion passage</a>.\n\nRemarkable videos of the encounter from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory\n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/potw.php?v=item&amp;id=79\">can\nbe found here</a>.",
