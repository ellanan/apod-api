Everest</a> stands 8.85 kilometers above sea level, \nroughly the maximum height reached by international \n<a href=\"ap010221.html\">airplane</a> flights, \nbut much less than the 300 kilometers achieved by a \n<a href=\"ap010723.html\">space shuttle</a>.  \n\nHundreds of people have tried and failed to climb the \n<a href=\"http://www.highalpex.com/Peaklist/peaklist.html\">behemoth</a> by foot, a feat \n<a href=\"http://teacher.scholastic.com/hillary/\">first accomplished successfully</a> in 1953.  \n\nAbout 1000 people have now made it to the summit.  \n\nRoddy Mackenzie, who climbed the mountain in 1989, captured the \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/climb/summitstill.html\">above image</a>.\n\nMt.
