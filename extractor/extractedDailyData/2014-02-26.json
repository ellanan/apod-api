  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes the more you look at an image, the more you see.\n\nSuch may be the case for \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rinsed/12633917883/in/photostream/\">this beautiful nighttime panorama</a> taken last week in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a>.\n\nVisible right off, on the far left, are common clouds, slightly altered by the digital fusion of combining 11 separate 20-second exposures.\n\nMore striking, perhaps, is the broad \n<a href=\"ap120725.html\">pink aurora</a> that dominates the right part of the image, \na less common auroral color that is likely tinted by excited \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a> atoms high in Earth's atmosphere. \n\nKeep looking and you might notice a bright light just beyond the mountain on the left.\n\nThat is the \n<a href=\"ap130130.html\">rising Moon</a> -- and an even closer look will reveal faint \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/rayim1.htm\">crepuscular rays</a> emanating from it.\n\nMusing over the image center may cause you to notice the \n<a href=\"ap990224.html\">central band</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> which \nhere appears to divide, almost vertically, the left clouds from the right aurora.\n\nInspecting the upper right of the image reveals a fuzzy patch, high in the sky, that is the \n<a href=\"ap100903.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a>. \n\n\nNumerous stars discretely populate the distant background.\n\nBack on Earth, the image foreground features two domes of the \n<a href=\"http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/research/mt_john/index.shtml\">Mt. John University Observatory</a> and a camera tripod looking to \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-68j-OC-NY\">capture</a> much of this scene over a serene \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_IIGGR2Zu0\">Lake Tekapo</a>.",
