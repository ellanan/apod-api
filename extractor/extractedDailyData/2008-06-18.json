  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat if the atmosphere above you became one gigantic lens?\n\nThis actually happens when a nearly transparent sheet of \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/crystpyr.htm\">pyramid shaped ice crystals</a> \nfalls from the sky in a common orientation.  \n\nThese <a href=\"ap080610.html\">ice-crystals act together</a> like millions of miniature ice mirrors, with external and internal reflections from different faces creating \n<a href=\"http://ao.osa.org/DirectPDFAccess/8907DFE1-BDB9-137E-C23E4EC85D5AF833_43347.pdf\">arcs and halos</a> of different radii.  \n\nAn <a href=\"ap060613.html\">amazing display</a> of pyramid ice crystal halos was \n<a href=\"http://www.ursa.fi/blogit/ice_crystal_halos/index.php\">captured</a> \non June 5 above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere\">Tampere</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland\">Finland</a>.  \n\nVisible above are \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/pyrhalo.htm\">very unusual sun halos</a> \nof 9, 18, 20, 23, and 24 degrees.\n\nIn contrast, thin and flat falling ice crystals will \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halosim.htm\">produce a halo</a> of \n<a href=\"ap080516.html\">22 degrees</a> only.  \n\nThe high clouds containing the ice crystals are faintly visible, as are some \n<a href=\"ap990823.html\">sundogs</a>. \n\nThe usual Sun image was covered behind a light post, \nand the above image was significantly digitally sharpened.  \n\nIt is not currently known how large areas of nearly uniform \n<a href=\"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/unusual/pyramid.jpg\">pyramidal ice crystals</a> form.",
