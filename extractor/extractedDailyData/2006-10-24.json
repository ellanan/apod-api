  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTwo galaxies are squaring off in \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/corvus.html\">Corvus</a> and \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/46/index.html\">here are the latest pictures</a>. \n\nWhen two \n<a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=351\">galaxies collide</a>, however, the stars that compose them usually do not. \n\nThis is because galaxies are mostly empty space and, however bright, stars only take up only a small amount of that space.  \n\nDuring the slow, hundred million year \n<a href=\"ap060630.html\">collision</a>, \nhowever, one galaxy can rip the other apart gravitationally, and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> and \n<a href=\"ap020129.html\">gas</a> common to both galaxies does collide.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/46/\">above clash</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans\">titans</a>, dark \n<a href=\"ap050424.html\">dust pillars</a> mark massive \n<a href=\"ap060409.html\">molecular clouds</a> are being compressed during the \n<a href=\"ap001102.html\">galactic encounter</a>, causing the rapid birth of millions of stars, \nsome of which are gravitationally bound together in \n<a href=\"ap021229.html\">massive star clusters</a>.",
