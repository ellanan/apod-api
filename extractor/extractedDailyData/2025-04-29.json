  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere are Saturn's ears?\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei\">Galileo</a> is credited, in 1610, as the first person to see \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/saturns-rings-2/\">Saturn's rings</a>.\n\nTesting out \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lipperhey\">Lipperhey</a>'s recently \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_telescope\">co-invented telescope</a>, Galileo did not know what they were and so called them \n\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#History\">ears</a>\". \n\nThe mystery deepened in 1612, when Saturn's ears \n<a href=\"https://www.petsonme.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Why-Do-Dogs-tilt-their-head-scaled.jpeg\">mysteriously disappeared</a>.\n\nToday we know exactly what happened: from the perspective of the \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a>, \nSaturn's rings had become \n<a href=\"ap100215.html\">too thin</a> to see. \n\nThe same drama \n<a href=\"ap150621.html\">plays out</a> every 15 years because Saturn, \nlike Earth, undergoes \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/\">tilt-driven seasons</a>.\n\nThis means that as Saturn goes around the Sun, its \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/equator_.png\">equator</a> and \n<a href=\"ap180424.html\">rings</a> can tilt noticeably toward the Sun and inner \n<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home\">Solar System</a>, making them easily visible, \nbut from other orbital locations will appear almost not at all.\n \nThe \n<a href=\"https://telescopius.com/pictures/view/224831/planet/by-natan_fontes\">featured picture</a> from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/m8fZeZTN0TE\">Brasilia</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil\">Brazil</a> \nshows a modern version of this sequence: the top ring-dominated image was taken in 2020, while the bottom ring-obscure image taken earlier in 2025.",
