  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn the night of December 15, the\nFull Moon was bright.\n\nKnown to some as the Cold Moon\nor the Long Night Moon, it was the closest Full Moon\nto the northern winter solstice and the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/the-next-full-moon-is-the-cold-moon-frost-moon-or-winter-moon/\">last Full Moon of 2024</a>.\n\nThis Full Moon was also at a\n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/lunar-standstill-2024-2025\">major lunar standstill</a>.\n\nA major lunar standstill is\n<a href=\"ap240629.html\">an extreme</a> in\nthe monthly north-south range of moonrise and moonset caused by the\nprecession of the Moon's orbit over an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_precession\">18.6 year cycle</a>.\n\nAs a result, the full lunar phase was near the Moon's northernmost moonrise\n(and moonset) along the horizon. \n\nDecember's Full Moon is rising in this stacked image, a\ncomposite of exposures recording the range of brightness visible\nto the eye on the northern winter night.\n\nAlong with a colorful\n<a href=\"ap240530.html\">lunar corona</a> and aircraft contrail\nthis Long Night Moon shines in a cold sky\nabove the rugged, snowy peaks of the Italian Dolomites.",
