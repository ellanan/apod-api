  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere was a shower over \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley\">Monument Valley</a> -- but not water. \n\nMeteors. \n\nThe featured image -- actually a composite of six exposures of about 30 seconds\neach -- was taken in 2001, a year when there was a very active \n<a href=\"ap101212.html\">Leonids shower</a>.\n\nAt that time, Earth was moving through a particularly dense swarm\nof sand-sized debris from \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/055p.html\">Comet Tempel-Tuttle</a>, \nso that meteor rates approached one visible streak per second.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid\">meteors</a>\nappear parallel because they all fall to Earth from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nRadiant_%28meteor_shower%29\">meteor shower radiant</a> -- \na point on the sky towards the constellation of the Lion \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_%28constellation%29\">Leo</a>).\n\nThe yearly Leonids \n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/en/\">meteor shower</a> \npeaks again this week.\n\nAlthough the Moon's glow should not obstruct the visibility of many meteors, \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/?p=29831\">this year's shower</a> \nwill peak with perhaps 15 <a href=\"ap011104.html\">meteors</a> visible in an hour, \na rate which is good but not expected to rival the \n<a href=\"ap011119.html\">2001 Leonids</a>. \n\nBy the way -- \n<a href=\" http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=151115\">how many meteors can you identify</a> \nin the featured image?",
