  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis dance is to the death. \n\nAlong the way, as these two large galaxies duel, a \n<a href=\"ap140715.html\">cosmic bridge</a> of stars, gas, and dust currently stretches\nover 75,000 <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light-years</a> and joins them. \n\nThe bridge itself is strong evidence\nthat these two immense star systems have\n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">passed close</a> to each other\nand experienced violent tides induced by\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/main.html\">mutual\ngravity</a>.\n\nAs further evidence, the face-on spiral galaxy on\nthe right, also known as NGC 3808A,\nexhibits many young blue star clusters produced in a burst\nof star formation.\n\nThe twisted edge-on spiral on the left (NGC 3808B) seems to be wrapped\nin the material <a href=\"ap061111.html\">bridging the galaxies</a> and\nsurrounded by a curious\n<a href=\"ap141108.html\">polar ring</a>.\n\nTogether, the system is known as \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2007/36/index.html\">Arp 87</a> \nand morphologically classified, technically, as \n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html\">peculiar</a>.\n\nWhile such interactions are drawn out over billions of years, repeated\n<a href=\"ap120717.html\">close passages</a> \nshould ultimately result in the death of one galaxy in the sense that \nonly one galaxy will eventually result.\n\nAlthough\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..623T\">this scenario</a> \ndoes look peculiar, galactic mergers are thought\nto be common, with Arp 87 representing a stage in\n<a href=\"http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jhibbard/MergeSeq/mergeseq.html\">this\ninevitable process</a>.\n\nThe Arp 87 pair are\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/36/\nfastfacts/\">about 300 million light-years</a>\ndistant toward the constellation Leo.\n\nThe prominent edge-on spiral at the far left\nappears to be a more distant background galaxy and\nnot involved in the on-going merger.",
