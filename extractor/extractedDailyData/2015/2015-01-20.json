  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt -- what secrets does it hold? \n\nTo find out, NASA has sent the \n<a href=\"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/spacecraft.asp\">robotic Dawn spacecraft</a> \nto explore and map this cryptic 1,000-kilometer wide world: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)\">Ceres</a>. \n\nOrbiting between \n<a href=\"ap140511.html\">Mars</a> and \n<a href=\"ap140517.html\">Jupiter</a>, \nCeres is officially categorized as a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a> but has never been imaged in detail.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19168\">Featured here</a> is a 20-frame video taken a week ago of \nDawn's approach that now rivals even the best \n<a href=\"ap060821.html\">images of Ceres</a> ever taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nThe video shows enough surface definition to discern its 9-hour rotation period.\n\nOn target to \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/30dec_dawn/\">reach Ceres in early March</a>, Dawn will match speeds and attempt \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFgJwdZxRc\">to orbit</a> this previously unexplored body, taking images and data that may help humanity \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfMBJngwtw\">better understand</a> \nnot only the nature and history of Ceres but also the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp68E6tBetY\">early history</a> of our entire \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/\">Solar System</a>.",
