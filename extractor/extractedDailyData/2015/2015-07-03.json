  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn June 30 Venus and Jupiter were actually far apart, but both\n<a href=\"ap150701.html\">appeared close</a> in western skies at dusk.\n\nNear the culmination of this year's\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/\n11jun_skyshow/\">gorgeous conjunction</a>,\nthe two bright evening planets are captured in the same telescopic\nfield of view in this sharp digital\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/191207/0/\">stack of images</a>\ntaken after sunset from Poznań in west-central Poland.\n\nIn fact, banded gas giant Jupiter was about 910 million kilometers\nfrom Poland.\n\nThat's over 11 times farther than crescent Venus, only 78 million\nkilometers distant at the time.\n\nBut since the diameter of giant planet Jupiter is over 11 times\nlarger than Venus both planets show about the same\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html\">angular size</a>.\n\nOf course, 16th century Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus\nwould also have enjoyed the simultaneous telescopic view\nincluding Jupiter's four Galilean moons and a crescent Venus.\n\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/\ngalileo.html\">Observations</a> of Jupiter's moons and Venus' crescent phase\nwere evidence for\n<a href=\"http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/copernican_system.html\">the\nCopernican</a> or heliocentric model of the solar system.",
