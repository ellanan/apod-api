  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis popular group is famous as the\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/more/m066gr.html\">Leo Triplet</a> -\na gathering of three magnificent galaxies in one field of view.\n\nCrowd pleasers when imaged with even modest\ntelescopes, they can be introduced individually as\nNGC 3628 (left), M66 (bottom right), and M65 (top).\n\nAll three are large\n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/Galaxies.html\">spiral\ngalaxies</a> but\nthey tend to look dissimilar because their galactic disks are\ntilted at different angles to our line of sight.\n\n<a href=\"ap140508.html\">NGC 3628</a> is seen edge-on,\nwith obscuring dust lanes\ncutting across the plane of the galaxy, while the disks\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2010/02/caption.html\">of M66</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1352a/\">M65 are</a>\nboth inclined enough to show off their spiral structure. \n\nGravitational interactions between galaxies in the group\nhave also left telltale signs, including the\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2001/23/caption.html\">warped</a>\nand inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66.\n\n<a href=\"http://hardcity.perso.sfr.fr/hardcity/NewWebSite/SiteWebAstro/\nTrioLeo.html\">This gorgeous view</a> of the region\nspans about one degree (two full moons) on the sky.\n\nThe field covers over 500 thousand light-years at the\ntrio's estimated distance of 30 million light-years.",
