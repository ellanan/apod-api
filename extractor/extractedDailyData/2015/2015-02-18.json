  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those bright spots on asteroid Ceres?\n\nAs the robotic spacecraft Dawn approaches the largest asteroid in the \n<a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)#mediaviewer/File:Ceres_Orbit.svg\">asteroid belt</a>, the puzzle only deepens.\n\nSharper <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4485\">new images</a> taken last week and released yesterday indicate, as expected, that most of the surface of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)\">dwarf planet Ceres</a> is dark and heavily cratered like our \n<a href=\"ap130716.html\">Moon</a> and the planet \n<a href=\"ap081103.html\">Mercury</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/display.cfm?News_ID=48822\">new images</a> do not clearly indicate, however, \nthe nature of comparatively bright spots -- although more of them are seen to exist. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/02061616-ceres-coming-into-focus.html\">enigmatic spots</a> were first noticed on \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>-sized \nCeres a few weeks ago during Dawn's approach.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.space.com/28336-mysterious-white-spot-on-ceres.html\">intriguing</a> \n<a href=\"http://space.io9.com/just-what-are-those-white-spots-on-ceres-1684160250\">mystery</a> might well be solved quickly as Dawn continues to advance toward \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Dwa_Ceres\">Ceres</a>, being \n<a href=\"http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/\">on schedule</a> to enter orbit on March 6.",
