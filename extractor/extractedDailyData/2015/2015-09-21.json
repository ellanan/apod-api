  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDust lanes seem to swirl around the core of\nMessier 96 in this\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1535a/\">colorful,\ndetailed portrait</a> of the center of a beautiful\n<a href=\"ap020518.html\">island universe</a>.\n\nOf course M96 is a \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2132.html\">spiral galaxy</a>, and counting the faint arms extending\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_96#/media/File:NGC_3368_ESO.jpg\">beyond the brighter central region</a>, it spans 100 thousand\nlight-years or so, making it about the size of our own \n<a href=\"http://mwmw.gsfc.nasa.gov/mmw_sci.html\">Milky Way</a>.\n\nM96, also known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_96\">NGC 3368</a>, \nis known to be about 35 million light-years distant and a dominant\nmember of the <a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/\ngalgrps/leoi.html\">Leo I galaxy group</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1535a/\">featured image</a> was taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nThe reason for \n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M96-HST-Gendler.html\">M96</a>'s asymmetry is unclear -- it could have arisen from gravitational interactions with other Leo I \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/09/08/m96_hubble_and_vlt_images_of_a_nearby_spiral_galaxy.html\">group galaxies</a>, but the lack of an intra-group diffuse glow seems to indicate \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...791...38W\">few recent interactions</a>.\n\nGalaxies far in the background can be found by \n<a href=\"http://fullyfeline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/peeking-around-the-corner.jpg\">examining the edges</a> of the picture.",
