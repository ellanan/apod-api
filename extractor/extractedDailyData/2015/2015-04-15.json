  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning.\n\nMore precisely, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the \n<a href=\"ap061022.html\">dusty stellar nurseries</a> in which they formed.\n\nLocated in the \n<a href=\"ap090524.html\">Carina Nebula</a> and known informally as \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/wallpaper/pr2010013a/\">Mystic Mountain</a>, \nthese pillar's appearance is dominated by the dark dust \neven though it is composed mostly of clear \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/rjn/apod/lib/lament.html\">hydrogen</a> gas.\n\nDust pillars such as these are actually much thinner than air and only appear as \n<a href=\"ap100426.html\">mountains</a> due to relatively small amounts of \nopaque interstellar <a href=\"http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html#dust\">dust</a>.  \n\nAbout 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, digitally reprocessed by an industrious amateur, and highlights \nan interior region of Carina which spans about three \n<a href=\" http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light years</a>.\n\nWithin a few million years, the stars will likely \nwin out completely and the entire dust \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK--hvgP2uY\">mountain will be destroyed</a>.",
