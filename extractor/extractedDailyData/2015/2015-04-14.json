  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to fly through a total eclipse of the Sun?\n\nOn a typical place on Earth in the path of the \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">dark shadow of the Moon</a> during a total eclipse, an observer would see the Moon cross the face of the Sun, completely blocking it for a few minutes. \n\nA particularly clear view of the darkness created on Earth during \n<a href=\"ap150321.html\">last</a> \n<a href=\"ap150322.html\">month</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap150331.html\">total</a> \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=34558\">solar</a> \n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/eclipse_gallery.html\">eclipse</a> was \n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/122893870\">captured by an aircraft</a> flying through the Moon's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra\">umbral</a> shadow. \n\nOne second of time in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTZQn19EwAU\">featured time-lapse video</a> \ncorresponds to about one minute of real time.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1998/ast23feb98_2/\">Moon's shadow</a> comes in from the right and leaves on the left, \nall while locations on Earth outside the \n<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/total-solar-eclipse.html\">umbral shadow</a> -- over 100 kilometers away -- remain partly sunlit.\n\nDuring the \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/solar.html\">next solar eclipse</a> in mid-September, \nthe Moon will, at most, block only part of the Sun.",
