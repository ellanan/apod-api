  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn only about 12,000 years\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=3647\">Vega</a>\nwill be the North Star, the closest\nbright star to our fair planet's\n<a href=\"ap131023.html\">North Celestial Pole</a>.\n\nBy then, when you fix your camera to a tripod\nlong exposures of the night sky\nwill show the concentric arcs of star trails centered\non a point near Vega as Earth <a href=\"ap070519.html\">rotates\non its axis</a>.\n\nOf course, presently the bright star conveniently near the\nNorth Celestial Pole is <a href=\"ap110514.html\">Polaris</a>,\nbut that will change as the Earth's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession\">axis of\nrotation precesses</a>,\nlike the wobble of a spinning top with a precession period of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession#/\nmedia/File:Precession_animation_small_new.gif\">about 26,000 years</a>.\n\nIf your camera is ready now and you don't want to wait 12,000 years\nfor Vega to be the North Star,\n<a href=\"http://www.miguelclaro.com/wp/?portfolio=\nthe-precession-of-earth-new-photo-technique-showing-a-vega-polar-startrail\">\nconsider this ingenious demonstration</a>\nof contemporary star trails (left) versus\nstar trails reminiscent\n<a href=\"http://longnow.org/about/\">of the year</a> 14000 CE.\n\nBoth were recorded this April at the\nAlqueva Dark Sky Reserve in Alentejo, Portugal.\n\nTo produce the more Vega-centric star trails of the\ndistant future, astronomer Miguel Claro\ncombined the rotation of two startracking camera mounts to\ncreate the apparent shift in the\nNorth Celestial Pole.\n\n(<i>Addendum: Thanks to APOD readers who note that when Vega\nis the North Star it will also appear near the same position that Polaris\nis now relative to the landscape.</i>)",
