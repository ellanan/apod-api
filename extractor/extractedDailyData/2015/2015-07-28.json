  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening over Bryce Canyon?\n\nTwo different optical effects that were captured in \n<a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/strangeghost/image/160701528/original\">one image taken</a> earlier this month.\n\nBoth effects needed to have the Sun situated directly behind the photographer.\n\nThe nearest apparition was the common \n<a href=\"http://scijinks.jpl.nasa.gov/rainbow/\">rainbow</a>, \ncreated by sunlight streaming from the setting sun over the head of the photographer, \nand scattering from raindrops in front of the canyon.\n\nIf you look closely, even a \n<a href=\"ap140930.html\">second rainbow</a> appears above the first.\n\nMore rare, and perhaps more striking, are the rays of light that emanate out from the horizon above the canyon.\n\nThese are known as <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/anti1.htm\">anticrepuscular rays</a> \nand result from sunlight streaming though breaks in the clouds, around the sky, and \n<a href=\"ap101128.html\">converging</a> at the point 180 degrees around from the Sun. \n\nGeometrically, this \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisolar_point\">antisolar point</a> \nmust coincide with the exact center of the rainbows.\n\nLocated in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, USA, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqnDHjm5yw\">Bryce Canyon</a> itself \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm\">contains</a> a \n<a href=\"ap140519.html\">picturesque array</a> of ancient \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast04dec_2/\">sedimentary rock</a> spires known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)\">hoodoos</a>.",
