  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was one strange sunset.\n\nFor one thing, the \n<a href=\"ap150430.html\">typically round Sun</a> appeared distorted, geometrically, and \n<a href=\"http://cutearoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kitten5.jpg\">multiply layered</a>.\n\nFor another, some of these layers appeared unusually green.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html\">Sun</a>, \nof course, was just fine -- its odd appearance was caused entirely by its \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD1544bM_c4\">light refracting</a> in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhen layers of the Earth's atmosphere are unusually warm, layers of the Sun may \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">appear distorted</a> or even seen multiple times.\n\nThe effect is most \n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">strong nearest sunrise and sunset</a> when terrestrial \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)\">inversion layers</a> \noccupy distinct \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/alt_az.htm\">altitudes</a> above the horizon.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/bh.html\">Different colors</a> \nof the Sun may also become deflected by significantly different amounts, so that the uppermost \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Superior_mirage\">superior image</a> may appear \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwus2nqU0SY\">momentarily green</a> -- a phenomenon known as a \n<a href=\"ap140604.html\">green flash</a>.\n\nThe featured image was taken in February from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT37TCDOmYk\">Porto Venere</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>, with \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._Peter_(Portovenere)\">San Pietro church</a> \nsituated in the foreground.",
