  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMajestic on a truly cosmic scale, M100 is appropriately known as a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_design_spiral_galaxy\">grand design</a> spiral galaxy. \n\nIt is a large galaxy of over 100 billion stars with well-defined spiral arms that is similar to our own \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/glimpse360/wwt\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nOne of the brightest members of the \n<a href=\"ap110422.html\">Virgo Cluster</a> of galaxies, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_100\">M100</a> \n(alias NGC 4321) is 56 million light-years distant toward the constellation of \nBerenice's Hair \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices\">Coma Berenices</a>). \n\n<a href=\"http://geckzilla.com/art/v/363\">This</a> Hubble \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/\">Space</a> Telescope \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/11694604174/\">image</a> of \nM100 was made in 2009 and reveals bright blue \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">star clusters</a> and \nintricate winding \n<a href=\"ap140726.html\">dust lanes</a> which are hallmarks of this class of galaxies. \n\nStudies of variable stars in \n<a href=\"http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~juda/ism/m100.html\">M100</a> \nhave played an important role in determining the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate96.html\">size and age of the Universe</a>.\n\nIf you know exactly \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2006X\">where to look</a>, \nyou can find a small spot that is a <a href=\"ap971023.html\">light echo</a> \nfrom a bright supernova that was \n<a href=\"ap060307.html\">recorded a few years before</a> the image was taken.",
