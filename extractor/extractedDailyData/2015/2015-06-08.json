  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that glowing in the distance?\n\nAlthough it may look like a \n<a href=\"ap071126.html\">lighthouse</a>, the rays of light near the horizon actually emanate from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion#Temple_of_Poseidon\">Temple of Poseidon</a> at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion\">Cape Sounion</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>. \n\nSome <a href=\"ap110504.html\">temple</a> \nlights are even reflected in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea\">Aegean Sea</a> in the foreground.\n\nAlthough meant to be a monument to the sea, in this image, \n<a href=\"ap100118.html\">the temple</a>'s lights seem to be pointing out locations on the sky. \n\nFor example, the wide ray toward the right fortuitously points toward the \n<a href=\"ap141125.html\">Lagoon Nebula</a> in the central band of our \n<a href=\"http://mwmw.gsfc.nasa.gov/mmw_product.html#viewgraph\">Milky Way</a>, which runs diagonally down the image from the upper left. \n\nAlso, the nearly vertical beam seems to point toward the star clouds near the direction of the \n<a href=\"ap030122.html\">Wild Duck open cluster of stars</a>.\n\nThe featured image was taken less than three weeks ago.",
