  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe setting is San Francisco Bay, the time is sunset, and the bridge is the \n<a href=\"http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php\">Golden Gate</a>.\n\nWhat you are about  \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iIR-vCXYOk\">to see</a> \nis an unexpected double sunset ending with a rare \n<a href=\"ap150908.html\">green flash</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/28972897\">Watch</a> closely -- in the recorded time-lapse sequence, \nunusually warm air created by bridge traffic refracts sunlight toward the Earth, \ncausing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Superior_mirage\">superior image</a> of the top of the Sun to form.\n\nThis image will disappear -- marking the first \"sunset\" -- only after the main image has dipped below the deck.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rock_Park\">All the while</a>, \nboats pass in the foreground, cars pass over the bridge, and clouds \n<a href=\"ap121218.html\">reflecting sunlight</a> drift by in the distance.\n\nThe scene ends with Earth's turbulent \n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/troposphere/en/\">atmosphere</a> \nitself creating a path that only \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html\">higher-energy visible</a> \nsunlight can traverse, making the last glimpse of our home star appear to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash\">flash green</a>.",
