  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nComet Catalina is ready for its close-up.\n\nThe giant snowball from the outer Solar System, known formally as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2013_US10\">C/2013 US10 (Catalina)</a>, \nrounded the Sun last month and is now \n<a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK13U10S\">headed for</a> \nits closest approach to Earth in January.\n\nWith the glow of the Moon now also out of the way, \n<a href=\"http://cdn.attackofthecute.com/August-10-2012-01-36-49-lksjdlkfjd.jpg\">morning observers</a> in Earth's northern hemisphere are getting their best ever view of the new comet.\n\nAnd <a href=\"ap150818.html\">Comet Catalina</a> is \n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/comet_gallery.html\">not disappointing</a>.\n\nAlthough not as bright as <a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2013US10/2013US10.html\">early predictions</a>, the comet is sporting both \n<a href=\"ap130526.html\">dust</a> (lower left) and \n<a href=\"ap150121.html\">ion</a> (upper right) \n<a href=\"ap131124.html\">tails</a>, \nmaking it an impressive object for binoculars and long-exposure cameras.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/fhhemmerich/23365590472/in/dateposted-public/\">featured image</a> was taken last week from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a>, off the northwest coast of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a>.\n\nSky enthusiasts around the world will surely be \n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/get-a-predawn-peek-of-comet-catalina-120320155/\">tracking the comet</a> over the next few months to see how it evolves.",
