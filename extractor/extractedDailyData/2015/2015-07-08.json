  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThat is not our Moon.\n\nIt's <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/dione/\">Dione</a>, \nand it�s a moon of Saturn.\n\nThe robotic <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> \ntook the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17196\">featured image</a> during a flyby of Saturn's cratered Moon last month. \n\nPerhaps what makes \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/07/05/cassini_beautiful_image_of_dione_and_rings.html\">this image</a> so interesting, though, is the background.\n\nFirst, the large orb looming behind \n<a href=\"ap070801.html\">Dione</a> is Saturn itself, \nfaintly lit by sunlight first reflected from the rings.\n\nNext, the thin lines running diagonally across the image are the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">rings of Saturn</a> themselves. \n\nThe millions of icy rocks that \n<a href=\"ap050525.html\">compose Saturn's spectacular rings</a> all orbit Saturn in the same \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/plane-geometry.html\">plane</a>, and so appear surprisingly thin when seen nearly edge-on.\n\nFront and center, \n<a href=\"ap120521.html\">Dione</a> appears in \n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-earth/moon-phases.html\">crescent phase</a>, partially lit by the Sun that is off to the lower left. \n\nA <a href=\"http://c8.alamy.com/comp/E0FHYR/jack-russell-dog-searching-under-sofa-for-toy-E0FHYR.jpg\">careful inspection</a> of the ring plane should also locate the moon \n<a href=\"ap091124.html\">Enceladus</a> on the upper right.",
