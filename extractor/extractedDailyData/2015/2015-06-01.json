  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy do some auroras pulsate?\n\nNo one is sure.\n\nAlthough this unusual behavior has been known for a long time, \nthe cause remains an active topic of research.\n\nFeatured here is a dramatic video that captured some impressive pulsating auroras in mid-March over \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-IBH1RjW74\">Sv�nafellsj�kull Glacier</a><a> in \n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/128714112\">48-second video</a> shown is not time-lapse. \n\nThe real-time pulsations are \n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/127443936\">exemplified by sequences</a> where the astrophotographer is visible moving about in the foreground. \n\nA close inspection of the enigmatic flickering \n<a href=\"ap061218.html\">sky colors</a> \nreveals that some structures appear to repeat, while others do not.\n\nThe quick rapidity of the pulsations seen here is somewhat unusual -- more common are \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora\">aurora</a> with pulsations that last several seconds.\n\n<a href=\"https://wiki.oulu.fi/display/SpaceWiki/Pulsating+aurora\">Recent research</a> shows that pulsations are more common in electron-generated aurora, \nrather than <a href=\"ap031217.html\">proton aurora</a>, and that the \n<a href=\"http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/magnet.html\">Earth's local magnetic field</a> may \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979JGR....84.3373W\">fluctuate in unison</a>.",
