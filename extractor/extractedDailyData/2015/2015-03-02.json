  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is not every day that such an interesting cloud \n<a href=\"http://www.metro.us/news/photo-queen-elizabeth-pulls-off-epic-photobomb/tmWngB---16tZoo5wZqRog/\">photobombs</a> your image.\n\nThe original plan was to photograph a rare angular \n<a href=\"ap150220.html\">conjunction</a> \n<a href=\"ap150228.html\">of</a> \n<a href=\"ap150226.html\">Mars and Venus</a> that occurred a week and a half ago, \nwith the added bonus of a crescent Moon and the \n<a href=\"http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) both passing nearby.\n\nUnfortunately, on \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira#Madeira_Island\">Madeira Island</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal\">Portugal</a>, \nthis event was clouded out.\n\nDuring the next day, however, a spectacular \n<a href=\"ap121104.html\">lenticular cloud</a> appeared before sunset, so the \n<a href=\"https://www.behance.net/urbanistas\">industrious astrophotographer</a> \nquickly formulated a new plan.  \n\nA close look at the \n<a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/23886283/A-strange-cloud-Mars-Venus-and-the-Moon\">resulting image</a> reveals the Moon visible toward the left of the frame, while underneath, near the bottom, are the famous planets with Venus being the brighter. \n\nIt was the unexpected \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_cloud\">lenticular cloud</a>, though, perhaps looking like some sort of futuristic \n<a href=\"http://www.chartgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/types-of-rockets1.jpg\">spaceship</a>, that stole the show. \n\nThe setting Sun illuminated the stationary cloud (and everything else) from the bottom, setting up an intricate pattern of shadows, layers, and brightly illuminated regions, all seen evolving in a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbLGbJbO1ZU\">corresponding video</a>. \n\nMars and Venus will \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjunctions_%28astronomy%29#2015\">next appear</a> this close on the sky in late August, \nbut whether any place on Earth will catch them behind such a photogenic cloud is unknown.",
