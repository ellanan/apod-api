  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nEight years ago, an evening sky held this lovely\npairing of a young crescent Moon\n<a href=\"ap020524.html\">and brilliant Venus</a>.\n\nSeen near the western horizon, the close conjunction and its\nwintry reflection were captured from Bolu, Turkey, planet Earth\non February 19, 2007.\n\nIn the 8\n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/age/\">Earth years since</a>\nthis photograph was taken\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/28151-how-to-see-venus-2015.html\">Venus\nhas orbited the Sun</a> almost exactly 13 times, so the Sun and\nVenus have now returned to the same the configuration in Earth's sky.\n\nAnd since every 8 years\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=8+year+lunar+cycle\">the Moon\nalso</a> nearly repeats its phases for a given time of year, a very similar\ncrescent Moon-Venus conjunction\nwill again appear in planet Earth's\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/\nmoon-venus-and-mars-bunch-up-at-nightfall-february-20\">evening\nskies tonight</a>.\n\nBut the February 20, 2015 version of the conjunction will also\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/main/index.html\">include\nplanet Mars</a>.\n\nMuch fainter Mars will wander even closer to Venus by the\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/\nvenus-mars-at-dusk-02132015/\">evening of February 21</a>.",
