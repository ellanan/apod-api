  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nFrom where do these neutrinos come?\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/about/overview\">IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> \nnear the South Pole of the Earth has begun to detect \n<a href=\"https://catonauts.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cat-kitty-katze-black-hiding-blanket-eyes-staring-hunter-lurk-watch-ambush-waiting.jpg\">nearly invisible</a> particles of very high energy.\n\nAlthough these rarely-interacting \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino\">neutrinos</a> pass through \nmuch of the Earth just before being detected, where they started remains a mystery.\n\n<a href=\"http://icecube.wisc.edu/gallery/press/view/1964\">Pictured here</a> \nis IceCube's Antarctic lab accompanied by a cartoon depicting \n<a href=\"ap110213.html\">long strands of detectors</a> frozen into the crystal clear ice below.\n\nCandidate origins for these cosmic neutrinos include the violent surroundings of supermassive \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes/\">black holes</a> at the centers of distant galaxies, and tremendous stellar explosions culminating in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JduQrZAEHX8\">supernovas</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uN1AjMui5k\">gamma ray bursts</a> far across the universe.\n\nAs <a href=\"http://news.wisc.edu/23954\">IceCube</a> detects increasingly more high energy \n<a href=\"ap980605.html\">neutrinos</a>, \ncorrelations with known objects may resolve this cosmic conundrum -- or we may never know.",
