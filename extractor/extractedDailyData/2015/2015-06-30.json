  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created this large mountain on asteroid Ceres?\n\nNo one is yet sure.\n\nAs if in anticipation of today being \n<a href=\"http://www.asteroidday.org/\">Asteroid</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_Day\">Day</a> on Earth, the robotic spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Dawn</a> in orbit around Ceres took the best yet image of an unusually tall mountain on the Asteroid Belt's largest asteroid.\n\nVisible at the top of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/pia19578/dawn-survey-orbit-image-10\">featured image</a>, the exceptional mountain rises about \nfive kilometers up from an area that otherwise appears pretty level.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19578\">image</a> was taken about two weeks ago from about 4,400 kilometers away. \n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/06/22/ceres_dawn_images_reveal_a_5_km_tall_mountain.html\">origin hypotheses for the mountain</a> include volcanism, impacts, and plate tectonics, clear evidence backing any of these is currently lacking. \n\nAlso visible \n<a href=\"ap150610.html\">across Ceres'</a> surface are some enigmatic light areas: \n<a href=\"ap150514.html\">bright spots</a> whose origin and composition that also \nremain an \n<a href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/OIamIdHV37I/maxresdefault.jpg\">active topic of investigation</a>.\n\nEven though Dawn is expected to continue to orbit Ceres, officially dubbed a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a>, for millions of years, the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UFTfwTxeEk\">hydrazine fuel</a> used to point \n<a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/whats-next-dawn-mission-keri-bean\">Dawn's communications</a> \nantenna toward Earth is expected to run out sometime next year.",
