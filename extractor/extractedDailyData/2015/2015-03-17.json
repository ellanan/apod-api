  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo you see it?  \n\nThis common question frequently precedes the rediscovery of one of the most commonly recognized configurations of stars on the northern sky: the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dipper\">Big Dipper</a>.  \n\nThis grouping of stars is one of the few things that has likely been seen, and will be seen, by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation\">every human generation</a>.   \n\nIn \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vegastarcarpentier/16146496113/\">this featured image</a>, however, the stars of the \n<a href=\"ap130421.html\">Big Dipper</a> have been digitally enhanced -- \nthey do not really appear this much \n<a href=\"http://gag.fm/uploads/posts/t/l-2313.png\">brighter</a> than \n<a href=\"ap010318.html\">nearby stars</a>. \n\nThe image was taken earlier this month from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>.\n\nThe Big Dipper is not by itself a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#History_of_the_constellations\">constellation</a>.  \n\nAlthough part of the constellation of the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Ursa_Major.html\">Great Bear</a> (Ursa Major), the \n<a href=\"ap050218.html\">Big Dipper</a> is an \n<a href=\"http://maps.seds.org/Const/asterism.html\">asterism</a> \nthat has been known by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper#Names\">different names</a> \nto different societies.\n\nFive of the Big Dipper \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">stars</a> are actually near each other in space and were \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major_Moving_Group\">likely formed</a> \nat nearly the same time.  \n\nRelative stellar motions will cause the \n<a href=\"http://www.dustbunny.com/afk/constellations/bigdipper/\">Big Dipper</a> to \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper#/media/File:Astro_4D_uma_rg_anim.gif\">slowly change</a> its \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/big-and-little-dippers-highlight-northern-sky#science\">apparent configuration</a> over the next 100,000 years.",
