  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening to that meteor?\n\nA few days ago, a bright fireball was \n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/KMS3d1qA6r32\">photographed from</a> the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a> mountain range in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland\">Switzerland</a> as it blazed across the sky. \n\nThe fireball, likely from the \n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2015/10/26/the-taurid-swarm-is-upon-us/\">Taurids meteor shower</a>, \nwas notable not only for how bright it was, but for the rare orange light it created that lingered for several minutes.\n\nInitially, the orange glow made it seem like the \n<a href=\"ap011122.html\">meteor trail</a> was on fire. \n\nHowever, the orange glow, known as a \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/10/02/a-meteors-lingering-tale/\">persistent train</a>, originated neither from fire nor sunlight-reflecting smoke. \n\nRather, the <a href=\"ap000428.html\">persistent train</a>'s glow emanated from atoms in the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> in the path of the meteor -- atoms that had an \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whelect.html\">electron</a> \nknocked away and emit light during reacquisition. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/video/examples/example5\">Persistent trains</a> often drift, \nso that the long 3-minute exposure actually captured the initial \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1511/OrionFireball_Scheggia_video.gif\">wind-blown displacement</a> of these bright former \n<a href=\"http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/1-what-is-an-ion.html\">ions</a>. \n\nThe featured image was acquired when trying to image the famous \n<a href=\"ap140408.html\">Orion Nebula</a>, visible on the upper left. \n\nThe bright blue star \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel\">Rigel</a>, part of the \n<a href=\"ap150316.html\">constellation of Orion</a>, is visible to the right.\n\nThis week the \n<a href=\"http://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2011/11/08/post_1320771751374/\">fireball-rich Taurids</a> meteor shower continues to be active even though it has passed its peak, \nwhile the more active \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/123251/from-a-roar-to-a-purr-prospects-for-the-2015-november-leonid-meteors/\">Leonids meteor shower</a> is just peaking.",
