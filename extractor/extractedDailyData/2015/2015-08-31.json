  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto\">Pluto</a> is more colorful than we can see.\n\nColor data and images of our Solar System's most famous \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a>, taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> during its \n<a href=\"ap150714.html\">flyby in July</a>, \nhave been digitally combined to give an enhanced view of this \nancient world sporting an unexpectedly young surface.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=265\">featured enhanced color image</a> is not only \n<a href=\"ap130401.html\">esthetically pretty</a> but \n<a href=\"http://littleheroes.s3.amazonaws.com/website_images/blog/science-project-a-3.jpg\">scientifically useful</a>, \nmaking surface regions of differing chemical composition visually distinct.\n\nFor example, the light-colored heart-shaped \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Pluto#Tombaugh_Regio\">Tombaugh Regio</a> on the lower right is clearly shown here to be divisible into two regions that are \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7yXXCSR3_UB12gNWETiygA\">geologically different</a>, with the leftmost lobe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Planum\">Sputnik Planum</a> also appearing unusually smooth.\n\nNew Horizons <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmtH0cRLUsA\">now continues</a> on beyond \nPluto, will continue to beam back more images and data, and will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kACaX-RNgSA\">soon be directed</a>\nto change course so that it can \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150828\">fly past asteroid 2014 MU69</a> in 2019 January.",
