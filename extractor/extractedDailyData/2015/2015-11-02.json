  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMost comets don't survive a close encounter with the Sun.\n\nTwo years ago this month, though, \n<a href=\" http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/comet_ison/\">Comet ISON</a> was thought by some to be big enough to withstand its perilous sungrazing dive.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2013_11_28/\">featured</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L54gUQTqko\">video</a> \nshows the drama as it was recorded by the \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/about/about.html\">Solar and Heliospheric Observatory</a> \n(SOHO), a joint mission of ESA and NASA.\n\nAs many \n<a href=\"http://www.smcubedconsulting.com/images/audience.jpg\">Earthlings watched</a> in fascination, \na bright area \n<a href=\"ap131130.html\">did emerge</a> from closest approach, but it \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/12/01/comet_ison_post_mortem.html\">soon faded</a> and dispersed.\n\nIt is now assumed that no large fragments of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_ISON\">Comet C/2012 S1</a> (ISON) survived. \n\nBesides the comet, the active Sun is seen to eject puffs of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast07sep99_1/\">plasma</a> \nknown as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">coronal mass ejections</a>.\n\nLaunched in 1995, \n<a href=\"http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/about/orbit.html\">sun-orbiting SOHO</a> \nhas become a historic device in the discovery and tracking of comets known as \n<a href=\"ap131027.html\">sungrazers</a>. \n\nTwo months ago, a comet designated \n<a href=\"http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2015/3000th-sungrazer-comet-imaged-by-nrl-space-instrument-lasco\">SOHO 3000</a> was named in honor of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/3000th-comet-spotted-by-solar-and-heliospheric-observatory-soho\">record 3000th comet</a> that was \n<a href=\"http://www.britastro.org/projectalcock/Finding%20comets%20on%20SOHO%20images.htm\">discovered on SOHO</a> images, a total that amounts to about half of all known comets.",
