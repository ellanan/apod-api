  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat causes the structure in Comet Lovejoy's tail? \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2014_Q2_(Lovejoy)\">Comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)</a>, \nwhich is currently at naked-eye brightness and \n<a href=\"http://cometbase.net/en/observation/listObserv/1104\">near its brightest</a>, \nhas been showing an exquisitely detailed ion tail. \n\nAs the name implies, the \n<a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a> is made of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0uPclhKPpM\">ionized gas</a> -- gas energized by \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html\">ultraviolet light</a> \nfrom the Sun and pushed outward by the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zOlkIyg3iE\">solar wind</a>. \n\nThe solar wind is quite structured and sculpted by the Sun's complex and ever \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/dynamo.shtml\">changing magnetic field</a>.\n\nThe effect of the variable solar wind combined with different gas jets venting from the comet's nucleus accounts for the tail's complex structure. \n\nFollowing the wind, structure in Comet Lovejoy's \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/115565761\">tail can be seen</a> to move outward from the Sun even alter its <a href=\"ap020515.html\">wavy appearance</a> over time. \n\nThe blue color of the ion tail is dominated by recombining \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide\">carbon monoxide</a> molecules, while the green color of the coma surrounding the head of the comet is created mostly by a slight amount of recombining \n<a href=\"http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem07/chem07441.htm\">diatomic carbon</a> molecules. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.irida-observatory.org/CCD/C_2014_Q2_2015_01_11/C_2014_Q2_2015_01_11_mosaic3.html\">featured three-panel mosaic image</a> was taken nine days ago from the \n<a href=\"http://www.irida-observatory.org/\">IRIDA Observatory</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/41%C2%B041'51.0%22N+24%C2%B044'19.0%22E/\">in</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria\">Bulgaria</a>. \n\nComet Lovejoy made it closest pass to the Earth two weeks ago and will be at its closest to the Sun in about ten days. \n\nAfter that, <a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/binocular-comet-lovejoy-heading-c2014-q2-lovejoy-1211142/\">the comet</a> will fade as it heads back into the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/outer-solar-system/\">outer Solar System</a>, to return only in about 8,000 years.",
