  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat creates these changing streaks on Mars?\n\nCalled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_flows_on_warm_Martian_slopes\">Recurring Slope Linea</a> (RSL), these dark features start on the slopes of \nhills and craters but don't usually extend to the bottom.\n\nWhat's even more unusual is that \n<a href=\"https://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/releases/rsl/\">these streaks</a> appear to change with the season, \nappearing fresh and growing during warm weather and disappearing during the winter.\n\nAfter <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars\">much study</a>, including a \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2546.html\">recent chemical analyses</a>, a leading hypothesis has emerged that these streaks are likely created by \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19919\">new occurrences</a> \nof liquid salty water that evaporates as it flows.\n\nThe source for the briny \n<a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/6462-brief-history-of-water-on-mars\">water</a> is still unclear, with two \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/09281219-nasas-mars-announcement.html\">possibilities</a> being condensation from the Martian atmosphere and underground reservoirs.\n\nAn exciting inference is that if these \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDv4FRHI3J8\">briny flows</a> are not too salty, they may be able to support \n<a href=\"ap090830.html\">microbial life</a> on Mars even today.\n\nThe featured image of a hill inside \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19918\">Horowitz Crater</a> was investigated by instruments aboard the robotic \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/overview/\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> \nthat has been returning data from Mars since 2006.",
