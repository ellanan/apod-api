  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn September 27/28, from all over\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=35218\">the\nplanet's nightside</a> moon watchers enjoyed a total lunar eclipse.\n\nThe dramatic celestial spectacle was\n<a href=\"ap151001.html\">widely imaged</a>, but\nthis lunar eclipse picture may look a little strange and\nunfamiliar, made with a point and shoot camera of\na bygone era.\n\nLoaded with a 4x5 inch sheet of film, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Graphic\">Speed Graphic</a>\ncamera was fixed to a tripod on\nthe Island of Cyprus.\n\nIts shutter locked open for 90 minutes, it recorded the trail of the\n<a href=\"ap150927.html\">Full Moon at perigee</a> from\nthe beginning of the partial eclipse phase (top)\nuntil mid-totality found the Moon near\nthe western horizon.\n\nEntering Earth's shadow, the Moon grew dimmer and its\n<a href=\"ap080220.html\">moontrail narrower</a> as the\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/141119607\">eclipse progressed</a>.",
