  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan you find which day is the winter solstice? \n\nEach panel shows one day.\n\nWith 360 movie panels, the sky over (almost) an entire year is shown in time lapse format \n<a href=\"http://www.murphlab.com/hsky/\">as recorded</a> by a video camera on the roof of the \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/\">Exploratorium</a> museum in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco\">San Francisco</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>.\n\nThe camera recorded an image every 10 seconds from before \n<a href=\"ap120920.html\">sunrise</a> to after \n<a href=\"ap120522.html\">sunset</a> and from mid-2009 to mid-2010. \n\nA time stamp showing the local time of day is provided on the lower right.\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/32095756\">The videos</a> are arranged chronologically, with July 28 shown on the upper left, \nand January 1 located about half way down. \n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNln_me-XjI&amp;f\">the videos</a>, darkness indicates night, blue depicts clear day, \nwhile gray portrays pervasive daytime cloud cover.\n\nMany videos show \n<a href=\"ap110516.html\">complex patterns of clouds moving</a> \nacross the camera's wide field as that day progresses.\n\nThe initial darkness in the middle depicts the delayed dawn and fewer daylight hours of winter.\n\nAlthough every day lasts 24 hours, <a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130118171218AAbk8TE\">nighttime lasts longest</a> in the northern hemisphere in December and the surrounding winter months.\n\nTherefore, finding the panel with the longest night will locate the day of winter \n<a href=\"http://scijinks.jpl.nasa.gov/solstice/\">solstice</a> -- \nwhich happens to be today in the northern hemisphere. \n\nAs the videos collectively end, \n<a href=\"ap120520.html\">sunset</a> and then \n<a href=\"ap110711.html\">darkness descend</a> first on the winter days just above the middle, \nand last on the mid-summer near the bottom.",
