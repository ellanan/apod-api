  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill Comet Catalina become visible to the unaided eye?\n\nGiven the unpredictability of comets, no one can say for sure, but it seems like a good bet.\n\nThe comet was discovered in 2013 by observations of the \n<a href=\"http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/\">Catalina Sky Survey</a>.\n\nSince then, \n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2013US10/2013US10.html\">Comet C/2013 US10</a> (Catalina) \nhas steadily brightened and is currently brighter than 8th\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude\">magnitude</a>, making it visible with binoculars and \nlong-duration camera images. \n\nAs <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/120726/comet-c2013-us10-catalina-a-preview-for-act-i/\">the comet</a> \nfurther approaches the inner Solar System it will surely \n<a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK13U10S\">continue</a> to intensify, \npossibly becoming a naked eye object sometime in October and \n<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/66/96/77/6696774f0521a0294581449599d10a90.jpg\">peaking</a> sometime in late November.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planets/cometpage.html\">comet</a> will reside primarily in the skies of the southern hemisphere until mid-December, at which time its highly inclined orbit will bring it quickly into northern skies.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astro-sharp.com/images/comets/C2013US10/c2013us10_20150811.544_ids.jpg\">Featured above</a>, \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2013_US10\">Comet Catalina</a> was imaged last week sporting a \n<a href=\"ap130207.html\">green coma</a> and \n<a href=\"ap131013.html\">two growing tails</a>.",
