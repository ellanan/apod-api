  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created these bright spots on Ceres?\n\nThe spots were \n<a href=\"ap150218.html\">first noted</a> as the \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/dawn/\">robotic Dawn spacecraft</a> approached \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)\">Ceres</a>, \nthe largest object in the \n<a href=\"ap060319.html\">asteroid belt</a>, in February, with the expectation that \n<a href=\"ap150514.html\">the mystery</a> would soon be solved in higher resolution images.\n\nHowever, even after Dawn arrived at Ceres in March, the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Inc9BtRip04\">riddle remained</a>.\n\nSurprisingly, although images including the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/dawn-takes-a-closer-look-at-occator\">featured</a> \n<a href=\"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news-detail.html?id=4714\">composite</a> \ntaken in the last month do resolve many details inside \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occator_(crater)\">Occator crater</a>, they do not resolve \n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/9pDd2VsMuXH\">the mystery</a>.\n\nAnother recent clue is that a \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/mystery-haze-appears-above-ceres-s-bright-spots-1.18032\">faint haze develops</a> over the crater's bright spots.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/marc-rayman/20150401-dawn-journal-preparing-to-photograph-ceres.html\">Dawn is scheduled</a> to continue to spiral down toward \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/09/10/ceres_hi_res_bright_spots_and_cracks.html\">Ceres</a> and scan the dwarf planet in \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/marc-rayman/20150401-dawn-journal-preparing-to-photograph-ceres.html\">several new ways</a> that, it is hoped, \nwill determine the chemical composition of the region and finally reveal the nature and history of the spots.\n\nIn several years, after running out of power, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(spacecraft)#Mission_conclusion\">Dawn will continue</a> \nto orbit Ceres indefinitely, becoming an artificial satellite and an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_on_the_Moon\">enduring monument</a> to \n<a href=\"ap141208.html\">human exploration</a>.",
