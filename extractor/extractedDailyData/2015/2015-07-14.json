  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill the New Horizons spacecraft survive its closest approach to Pluto and return useful images and data?\n\nHumanity will know in a few hours.\n\nRegardless of how well it functions, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html\">New Horizon</a>'s \nrapid speed will take it whizzing past Pluto and its moons today, \nwith the time of closest approach being at 11:50 \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/universal-time\">UT</a> (7:50 am \n<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/edt\">EDT</a>).\n\nTo better take images and data, though, the robotic spacecraft was \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNSGTbS3xuQ\">preprogrammed</a> and taken intentionally out of contact with the Earth until about 1:00 am \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time\">UT</a> July 15, which corresponds to about 9:00 pm \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone\">EDT</a> on July 14. \n\nTherefore, much of mankind will be holding its breath through this day, hoping that the \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Payload.php\">piano-sized spacecraft</a> \ncommunicates again with \n<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/australian-centre-helps-new-horizons-getting-up-close-with-pluto/6616834\">ground stations</a> on Earth. \n\nHopefully, at that time, \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceanswers.com/solar-system/five-amazing-facts-about-the-new-horizons-probe/\">New Horizons</a> will begin beaming back new and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/pluto-s-bright-mysterious-heart-is-rotating-into-view\">enlightening</a> data about a world that has remained remote and mysterious since its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh\">discovery</a> \n85 years ago.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-big-is-pluto-new-horizons-settles-decades-long-debate\">Featured above</a> is a New Horizons composite image of the moon \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(moon)\">Charon</a> (left) and \n<a href=\"ap150713.html\">Pluto</a> (right) taken 3 days ago, already showing \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/121330/charon-up-close-reveals-colossal-chasms-and-craters-1-day-and-1-million-miles-out-from-pluto-flyby/#more-121330\">both worlds</a> in unprecedented detail.",
