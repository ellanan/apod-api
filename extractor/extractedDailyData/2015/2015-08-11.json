  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever seen a halo around the Moon?\n\nSuch <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halosim.htm\">22 degree rings</a> around the Moon -- caused by \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/crhal.htm\">ice crystals</a> \nfalling in the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> -- are \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLiu8Fto4XY\">somewhat rare</a>. \n\nOK, but have you ever seen a blue moon?\n\nGiven the modern definition of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_moon\">blue moon</a> -- the second full moon occurring in a calendar month -- these are also rare. \n\nWhat is featured above might therefore be considered doubly rare -- a \n<a href=\"ap121120.html\">halo</a> surrounding a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyBp-EYrwTA\">blue moon</a>.\n\nThe featured image was taken late last month near \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Zhongshan_Station\">Zhongshan Station</a> \nin Antarctica. \n\nVisible in the foreground are a power generating house and a \n<a href=\"ap111211.html\">snowmobile</a>.\n\nWhat might seem to be stars in the background are actually illuminated snowflakes near the camera.",
