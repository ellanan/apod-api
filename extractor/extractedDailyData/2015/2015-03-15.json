  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWould you go to the end of the world to see a total eclipse of the Sun?\n\nIf you did, would you be surprised to find someone else \n<a href=\"http://www.icstars.com/Antarctica/Eclipse2003.html\">there already?</a>\n\nIn 2003, the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun\">Sun</a>, the Moon, Antarctica, and two photographers all lined up in\n<a href=\"ap991116.html\">Antarctica</a> during an unusual\n<a href=\"ap100730.html\">total solar eclipse</a>.  \n\nEven given the extreme location, a group of\n<a href=\"http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html\">enthusiastic eclipse chasers</a> ventured near the\nbottom of the world to\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUNau9YjA2U\">experience the surreal</a> momentary\ndisappearance of the <a href=\"ap010706.html\">Sun behind the Moon</a>.  \n\nOne of the treasures collected was the\n<a href=\"http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html\">above picture</a> -- a composite of four separate images\ndigitally combined to realistically simulate how the adaptive human\n<a href=\"ap010408.html\">eye saw</a> the eclipse.  \n\nAs the image was taken, both the\n<a href=\"ap031127.html\">Moon and the Sun</a>\npeeked together over an Antarctic ridge.  \n\nIn the\n<a href=\"ap030106.html\">sudden darkness</a>, the\n<a href=\"ap100316.html\">magnificent corona</a>\nof the Sun became visible around the Moon.  \n\nQuite by accident, another photographer was caught\nin one of the images checking his video camera.   \n\nVisible to his left are an equipment bag and a\n<a href=\"http://www.abriefourie.com/crossingcontinue_01.html\">collapsible chair</a>. \n\nA total solar eclipse will \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_March_20,_2015\">occur on Friday</a> and be visible from the north Atlantic Ocean.",
