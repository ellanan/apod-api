  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTen <a href=\"ap140304.html\">Earths</a> \ncould easily fit in the \"claw\" of this seemingly solar monster.  \n\nThe monster, actually a huge eruptive prominence, is seen moving out from our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun\">Sun</a> in this condensed half-hour time-lapse sequence.  \n\n<a href=\"image/1501/proanim3_soho_640.mp4\">This \nlarge prominence</a>, though, is significant \nnot only for its size, but its shape.  \n\nThe twisted figure eight shape \nindicates that a complex \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml\">magnetic field</a> threads \nthrough the emerging \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">solar particles</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/press/00/pr0015.htm\">Differential rotation</a> of gas just inside the surface of the \nSun might help account for the surface explosion.  \n\n<a href=\"image/1501/proanim3_soho_640.mp4\">The five frame sequence</a> was taken in early 2000 by the \nSun-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/about/spacecraft.html\">SOHO satellite</a>.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"ap110307.html\">large prominence</a>s \nand energetic \n<a href=\"ap070206.html\">Coronal Mass Ejection</a>s \n(CMEs) are relatively rare, \nthey are again occurring more frequently now that we are near the \n<a href=\"http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2013/solarmax/\">Solar Maximum</a>, a time of \npeak sunspot and \n<a href=\"ap140720.html\">solar activity</a> in the eleven-year \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle\">solar cycle</a>.",
