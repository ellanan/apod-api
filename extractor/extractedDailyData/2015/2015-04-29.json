  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening to Comet 67P/Churyumov�Gerasimenko?\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">3-km wide comet</a> moves closer to the Sun, heat causes the nucleus to\n<a href=\"ap150203.html\">expel gas and dust</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Rosetta spacecraft</a> \narrived at the \n<a href=\"ap140807.html\">comet's craggily double nucleus</a> \nlast July and now is co-orbiting the Sun with the \n<a href=\"http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/67P-LA-anosmicovni-credit-BEST.jpg\">giant dark iceberg</a>. \n\nRecent <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6220/1261952.abstract\">analysis</a> of data beamed back to Earth from the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Orbiter_Instruments\">robotic Rosetta spacecraft</a> has shown that water being expelled by 67P has a significant difference with water on Earth, indicating that \n<a href=\" http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/science/rosetta-mission-data-rules-out-comets-as-a-source-for-earths-water.html\">Earth's water could not have originated from ancient collisions with comets</a> like 67P.\n\nAdditionally, neither Rosetta nor its \n<a href=\"ap141112.html\">Philae lander</a> detected a magnetic field around the comet nucleus, indicating that <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_and_Philae_find_comet_not_magnetised\">magnetism might have been unimportant</a> in the evolution of the early Solar System. \n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/04/22/crescent-comet-cometwatch-15-and-16-april/\">Comet 67P</a>, shown in a \n<a href=\"ap130414.html\">crescent phase</a> in false color, \nshould increase its evaporation rate as it nears its closest approach to the Sun in 2015 August, \nwhen it reaches a Sun distance just a bit further out than the Earth.",
