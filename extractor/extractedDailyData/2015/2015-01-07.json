  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/01/\">To\ncelebrate 25 years</a> (1990-2015) of exploring the Universe from\nlow Earth orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope's cameras were\nused to revisit its most iconic image.\n\nThe result is this sharper, wider view of the region dubbed the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/01/\nfastfacts/\">Pillars of Creation</a>, first imaged by Hubble in\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1995/\n1995/44/\">1995</a>.\n\nStars are forming deep inside the towering structures.\n\nThe light-years long columns of cold gas and dust are some\n6,500 light-years\n<a href=\"ap140607.html\">distant in M16</a>, the Eagle Nebula, toward the\nconstellation Serpens.\n\nSculpted and eroded by the energetic ultraviolet light and\npowerful winds from M16's cluster of young, massive stars,\nthe cosmic pillars themselves are destined for destruction.\n\nBut the turbulent environment of star formation within M16, whose\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2015/01/supplemental.html\">spectacular\ndetails</a> are captured in this Hubble visible-light\nsnapshot, is likely similar to the environment that formed our own Sun.",
