  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTelescopic observers on Earth have been treated to spectacular\nviews of Saturn lately as the ringed planet reached its 2015\nopposition on May 23 at 0200 UT.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/\nindex.html\">Of course</a> opposition means opposite the Sun in Earth's sky.\n\nSo near\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/120162/\na-guide-to-saturn-through-opposition-2015/\"> opposition Saturn is\nup all night</a>, at its closest and brightest\nfor the year.\n\n<a href=\"http://saturn.cstoneind.com/\">These sharp images</a>\ntaken within hours of the Sun-Earth-Saturn\nalignment also show the strong brightening  of Saturn's rings\nknown as the opposition surge or the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_surge\">Seeliger Effect</a>.\n\nDirectly illuminated, the ring's icy particles cast no shadows and\nstrongly backscatter sunlight toward planet Earth,\ncreating the dramatic surge in brightness.\n\nSaturn currently stands in the\n<a href=\"ap150423.html\">sky not far</a> from bright Antares,\nalpha star of the constellation Scorpius.",
