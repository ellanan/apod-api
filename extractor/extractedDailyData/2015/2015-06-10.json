  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to fly over dwarf planet Ceres?\n\nAnimators from the \n<a href=\"http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10002/\">German Aerospace Center</a> recently took actual images and height data from NASA's robotic Dawn mission -- currently visiting Ceres -- to generate several \n<a href=\"ap120514.html\">fascinating virtual sequences</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-hYSBghEn0\">featured video</a> begins with a mock orbit around the 950-km wide space rock, with the crater featuring two of the \n<a href=\"ap150514.html\">enigmatic white spots</a> soon rotating into view.\n\nThe next sequences take the viewer around the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)\">Ceres'</a> \nnorth and south poles, and then over a \nlimb of the dark world highlighting its heavily cratered surface.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=1380\">Here</a>, \nterrain height on the \n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/185-What-is-the-asteroid-belt-\">asteroid belt</a>'s largest object has been digitally doubled, \nwhile an artificial star field has been added in the background. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Dawn</a> \n<a href=\"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/\">spacecraft</a> \nwill likely remain an unusual \n<a href=\"ap010127.html\">artificial moon</a> of \nCeres long after its mission concludes.",
