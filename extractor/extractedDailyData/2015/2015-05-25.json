  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nFirst came the trees.\n\nIn the town of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamanca\">Salamanca</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, the photographer noticed how distinctive a grove of \n<a href=\"https://www.arborday.org/shopping/trees/oak.cfm\">oak trees</a> \nlooked after being \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOUmwURwl1M\">pruned</a>. \n\nNext came the galaxy.\n\nThe photographer \n<a href=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2545/3690526146_80a01c34a5_z.jpg\">stayed up</a> until 2 am, waiting until the \n<a href=\"http://mwmw.gsfc.nasa.gov/mmw_product.html#poster\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nrose above the level of a majestic looking oak. \n\nFrom this carefully chosen perspective, \n<a href=\"ap140724.html\">dust lanes in the galaxy</a> \nappear to be natural continuations to branches of the tree. \n\nLast came the light.\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.energizer.com/about-flashlights/how-does-a-flashlight-work\">flashlight</a> was used on the far side of the tree to project a \n<a href=\"ap140803.html\">silhouette</a>.\n\nBy coincidence, other trees also appeared as similar \n<a href=\"ap120528.html\">silhouettes</a> across the relatively bright horizon.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/109130405/sombras-chinescas-by-c%C3%A9sar-vega\">featured image</a> was captured as a single 30-second frame earlier this month and processed to digitally enhance the Milky Way.",
