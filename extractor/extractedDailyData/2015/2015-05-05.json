  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that under the surface of Mercury?\n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/f_messenger-extreme.html\">MESSENGER spacecraft</a> that had been orbiting planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury\">Mercury</a> for the past four years had been transmitting its data back to Earth with \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves.html\">radio waves</a> of very precise energy. \n\nThe planet's gravity, however, \nslightly changed this energy when measured on Earth, which enabled the reconstruction of a \n<a href=\"ap141215.html\">gravity map</a> of unprecedented precision. \n\n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=4&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=1565\">Here</a> gravitational anomalies are shown in \n<a href=\"http://cdn.instructables.com/FO6/KUMA/GZUAFBQ9/FO6KUMAGZUAFBQ9.LARGE.jpg\">false-color</a>, superposed on an image of the \n<a href=\"ap081008.html\">planet's cratered surface</a>.\n\nRed hues \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014JGRE..119.2417M\">indicate</a> areas of slightly higher gravity, \nwhich in turn indicates areas that must have unusually dense matter under the surface.\n\nThe central area is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloris_Basin\">Caloris Basin</a>, \na huge impact feature measuring about 1,500 kilometers across.\n\n<a href=\"ap150501.html\">Last week</a>, after completing \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwD31EDFjc\">its mission</a> and running low on fuel, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> was purposely crashed onto Mercury's surface.",
