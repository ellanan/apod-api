  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis dramatic outburst from the nucleus of\nComet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\noccured on August 12, just hours before perihelion,\n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/08/13/\nrosettas-big-day-in-the-sun/\">its closest approach to the Sun</a>.\n\nCompleting an orbit of the Sun once every 6.45 years,\nperihelion distance for this periodic comet is about 1.3\nastronomical units (AU),\nstill outside the orbit of planet Earth (at 1 AU).\n\nThe stark image of the\n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/08/13/\nnew-interactive-viewer-for-comet-67pc-g/\">4 kilometer wide,\ndouble-lobed nucleus</a>\nin bright sunlight and dark shadows\nwas taken by the Rosetta spacecraft's science camera\nabout 325 kilometers away.\n\nToo close to see the\n<a href=\"http://sen.com/images/damian-peach#2092\">comet's growing tail</a>,\nRosetta maintains its\n<a href=\"http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/\">ringside seat to watch</a>\nthe nucleus warm and become more active in coming weeks, as primordial ices\n<a href=\"ap130907.html\">sublimating</a>\nfrom the surface produce jets of gas and dust.\n\nOf course, dust from the nucleus of periodic comet Swift-Tuttle,\nwhose last perihelion passage was in 1992 at a distance of 0.96 AU,\n<a href=\"ap150814.html\">fell to Earth</a> just this week.",
