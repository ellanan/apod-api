  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's back. \n\nNever before has an observed supernova been predicted.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1505/\">unique astronomical event</a> \noccurred in the field of galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223.\n\nMost bright spots in the \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/ann15088a/\">featured image</a> are galaxies in this cluster. \n\nThe actual supernova, dubbed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_Refsdal\">Supernova Refsdal</a>, \noccurred just once far across the universe and well behind this massive galaxy cluster. \n\nGravity caused the cluster to act as a massive \n<a href=\"http://www.cfhtlens.org/public/what-gravitational-lensing\">gravitational lens</a>, \nsplitting the image of Supernova Refsdal into \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/fermi_gravitational_lensing/\">multiple bright images</a>.\n\nOne of these images arrived at Earth about ten years ago, likely in the upper red circle, and was missed. \n\nFour <a href=\"ap150309.html\">more bright images</a> \npeaked in April in the lowest red circle, spread around a massive galaxy in the cluster as the first \n<a href=\"ap130102.html\">Einstein Cross</a> supernova.\n\nBut there was more. \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800L..26S\">Analyses revealed</a> that a sixth bright \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-supernova.html\">supernova</a> image was likely still on its way to Earth and likely to arrive within the next year. \n\nEarlier this month -- right on schedule -- this sixth bright image was \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=8402\">recovered</a>, \nin the middle red circle, as predicted. \n\nStudying image sequences like this help humanity to understand how matter is distributed in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/what-is-dark-matter.html\">galaxies and clusters</a>, how \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_expansion.html\">fast the universe expands</a>, \nand how massive \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgfbjHz_UTo\">stars explode</a>.",
