  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n4631.html\">NGC\n4631 is a spiral galaxy</a> found only 25 million light-years away,\ntoward the well-trained northern constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cvn/index.html\">Canes\nVenatici</a>.\n\nSeen egde-on, the galaxy is similar in size to\nthe Milky Way.\n\nIts distorted wedge shape suggests to\nsome a cosmic herring and to others its popular moniker,\nThe Whale Galaxy.\n\nThe large galaxy's small, remarkably bright elliptical\ncompanion NGC 4627 lies just above its dusty yellowish core,\nbut also identifiable are recently\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04446\">discovered</a>,\nfaint dwarf galaxies within the halo of NGC 4631.\n\nIn fact, the faint extended features below (and above)\nNGC 4631 are now recognized as tidal star streams.\n\nThe star streams are remnants of a dwarf satellite galaxy\ndisrupted by repeated <a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\nsmall_new_ngc4631.html\">encounters with the Whale</a> that began\nabout 3.5 billion years ago.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\ngalaxy_formation_and_evolution.html\">Even in nearby galaxies</a>,\nthe presence of tidal star streams is\npredicted by cosmological models of galaxy formation, including the\n<a href=\"ap100125.html\">formation of our own Milky Way</a>.",
