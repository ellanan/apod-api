  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nRising at the start of a northern summer's night, these\nthree bright stars form the familiar asterism known as\n<a href=\"ap150506.html\">the Summer Triangle</a>.\n\nAltair, Deneb, and Vega\nare the alpha stars of their respective constellations, Aquila, Cygnus,\nand Lyra, nestled near the Milky Way.\n\nClose in apparent brightness the three do look similar in these\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DeepSkyColors/photos/\npb.511507152249936.-2207520000.1435352560./\n891106127623368/?type=1&amp;theater\">telescopic portraits</a>,\nbut all have\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/whitesta.html\">their own\nstellar stories.</a>\n\nTheir similar appearance hides the fact that\nthe Summer Triangle stars actually span a large range in\nintrinsic luminosity and distance.\n\nA <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence\">main sequence</a>\ndwarf star, Altair is some 10 times brighter\nthan the Sun and 17 light-years away, while\nVega, also a hydrogen-fusing dwarf, is around 30 times brighter than\nthe Sun and lies 25 light-years away.\n\nSupergiant Deneb, at about 54,000 times the solar luminosity,\nlies some 1,400 light-years distant.\n\n<a href=\"ap110211.html\">Of course</a>, with a whitish blue hue,\nthe stars of the Summer Triangle are all hotter than\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/main/index.html\">the Sun</a>.",
