  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was a typical Texas sunset except that most of the Sun was missing. \n\nThe location of the missing piece of the Sun was not a mystery -- it was \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=28634\">behind the Moon</a>. \n\nFeatured here is one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ25zCJlUm0\">more interesting</a> images taken of a partial solar eclipse that occurred in 2012, capturing a temporarily crescent Sun setting in a reddened sky behind brush and a windmill.\n\nThe image was taken about 20 miles west of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown,_Texas\">Sundown</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>, USA, just after the \n<a href=\"ap090125.html\">ring of fire</a> effect was broken by the \nMoon <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr8kIzNP8SI\">moving away</a> \nfrom the center of the Sun. \n\nToday a new \n<a href=\"ap150322.html\">partial</a> \n<a href=\"ap131104.html\">solar</a> \n<a href=\"ap120528.html\">eclipse</a> of the Sun will be visible from Earth. \n\nUnfortunately for people who live in Texas, today's \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2015.html\">eclipse</a> \ncan only be seen from southern Africa and Antarctica.",
