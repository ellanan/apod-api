  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA long solar filament stretches across the relatively calm\nsurface of the Sun in this telescopic snap shot from April 27.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap121015.html\">negative or inverted</a>\nnarrowband image was made in the light of\nionized hydrogen atoms.\n\nSeen at the upper left, the magnificent curtain of magnetized plasma\ntowers above surface and actually reaches beyond the Sun's edge.\n\nHow long is the solar filament?\n\nAbout as long as the distance from Earth to Moon, illustrated\nby the scale insert at the left.\n\nTracking toward the right across\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\narchive.php?view=1&amp;day=28&amp;month=04&amp;year=2015\">the solar disk a day later</a>\nthe long filament erupted, lifting away from the Sun's surface.\n\nMonitored by\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/soho/index.html\">Sun\nstaring satellites</a>, a coronal mass ejection was\nalso blasted from the site but is expected to swing wide of\n<a href=\"ap150319.html\">our fair planet</a>.",
