  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne of these two bright sky objects is moving.\n\nOn the right is the famous star Polaris.\n\nAlthough only the 45th \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars\">brightest star</a> in the sky, \n<a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a> is famous for appearing stationary.\n\nOnce you find it, it will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqC4kWHMfVc\">always appear</a> \nin the same direction -- \nall night and all day -- for the rest of your life. \n\nThis is because the northern spin pole of the Earth -- called the \n<a href=\"http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/concepts/northerncelestialpole.html\">North Celestial Pole</a> -- points near \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...274..755A\">Polaris</a>.\n\nOn the left, about ten million times closer, is \n<a href=\"ap150227.html\">Comet Lovejoy</a>, \nwhich noticeably changes its sky position by the hour.\n\nThe featured image was taken last week. \n\nOfficially designated \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2014_Q2_(Lovejoy)\">C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)</a>, \nthis disintegrating snowball is on a visit from the outer \n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Solar System</a> \nand will only appear near the \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star\">North Star</a> for a few more weeks.\n\nThat should be \n<a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK14Q020\">long enough</a>, however, for northerners with binoculars or a small telescope \n<a href=\"http://cometbase.net/en/observation/listObserv/1104\">to see</a> the greenish coma of this fleeting newcomer, perhaps with the help of a \n<a href=\"http://www.bluewaterastronomy.info/files/lovejoy-to-jun-3.jpg\">good star map</a>.",
