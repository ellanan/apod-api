  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Sun return to the same spot on the sky every day?  No. \n\nA better and more visual answer to that question is an \n<a href=\"ap130922.html\">analemma</a>, \na composite image taken from the same spot at the same time over the course of a year.\n\nThe featured weekly analemma was taken despite \n<a href=\"http://cdn.cutestpaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/s-bundle-up-for-winter.jpg\">cold temperatures</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKUipxR3bDc\">high winds</a> near the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia Station\">Concordia Station</a> in Antarctica.\n\nThe position of the Sun at 4 pm was captured on multiple days in the digital composite image, \nbelieved to be the first <a href=\"ap131014.html\">analemma</a> constructed from \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-antarctica-k4.html\">Antarctica</a>.\n\nThe reason the image only shows the Sun from September to \nMarch is because the Sun was below the horizon for much of the rest of the year.\n\nIn fact, today being an \n<a href=\"ap140319.html\">equinox</a>, the Sun rises today at the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/dictionary/South_Pole.html\">South Pole</a> \nafter a six month absence and won't set again until the next \n<a href=\"ap120923.html\">equinox</a> in March, baring \n<a href=\"http://www.novayazemlya.net/Novaya-Zemlya-Effect.html\">large atmospheric refraction effects</a>.\n\nConversely, today the Sun <i>sets</i> at the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/thick-melt.html\">North Pole</a> \nafter half a year of continuous daylight.\n\nFor all of the Earth in between, though, the \n<a href=\"ap140922.html\">equinox</a> means that today will have a nighttime and daytime that are both 12 hours long.",
