  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nPluto surface is strange.\n\nAs the robotic \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a> \nbarrels toward its closest approach to Pluto and its moons tomorrow, \nimages already coming back show Pluto's surface to be \n<a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-II.html\">curiouser and curiouser</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150711-2\">featured image</a>, taken two days ago, shows the side of Pluto that always faces Pluto's largest moon \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(moon)\">Charon</a>.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the \n<a href=\"ap150711.html\">dark belt near the bottom</a> that circles Pluto's equator.\n\nIt is currently unclear whether regions in this dark belt are mountainous or flat, why boundaries are so sharply defined, and why the light regions seem to be nearly evenly spaced. \n\nAs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaElspuqbUA\">New Horizons</a> will be flying past the other side of Pluto, this should be the best image of this distant landscape that humanity sees for a long time. \n\nAssuming the robotic spacecraft operates as hoped, images taken of the other side of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-pluto-k4.html\">Pluto</a>, taken near closest approach, will be about 300 times more detailed.",
