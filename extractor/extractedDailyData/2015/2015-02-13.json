  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNot from a snowglobe, this expansive fisheye\nview of ice and sky was captured on February 1, from\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=a7pLQeioQMo\">Jökulsárlón Beach</a>,\nsoutheast Iceland, planet Earth.\n\nChunks of glacial ice on the black sand beach glisten in the\nlight of a nearly full moon surrounded by\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circular.htm\">a shining halo</a>.\n\nThe 22 degree lunar halo itself is created by ice crystals in\nhigh, thin clouds refracting the moonlight.\n\nDespite the bright moonlight, curtains of aurora still\ndance through the surreal scene.\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\narchive.php?view=1&amp;day=01&amp;month=02&amp;year=2015\">In early February</a>,\ntheir activity was triggered by Earth's restless magnetosphere\nand the energetic wind from a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/\nsolar-dynamics-observatory-welcomes-the-new-year/\">coronal hole</a>\nnear the Sun's south pole.\n\nBright Jupiter, also near opposition, is visible at the\nleft, beyond the icy lunar halo.",
