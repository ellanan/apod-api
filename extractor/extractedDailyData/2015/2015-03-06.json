  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe faint and somehow menacing cometary globule CG4\nreaches through the center of\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophoton.com/cg04.htm\">this deep southern\nskyscape</a>.\n\nAbout 1,300 light-years from Earth toward the constellation Puppis,\nits head is about 1.5 light-years in diameter and its tail about\n8 light-years long.\n\nThat's far larger than the Solar System's comets that\nit seems to resemble.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1180\">In fact,\nthe dusty cloud</a> contains enough material to form several Sun-like\nstars and likely has ongoing star formation within.\n\nHow its distinctive form came about is still debated, but its\nlong tail trails away from the\n<a href=\"ap150101.html\">Vela Supernova remnant</a> near the\ncenter of the Gum Nebula, while its head could represent\nthe rupture of an originally more spherical cloud.\n\nStill, the edge-on spiral galaxy also near picture center is not\nactually being\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1503/\">threatened by CG4</a>.\n\nThe galaxy lies in the distant background more than 100 million\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_%28Dune%29\">light-years\naway</a>.",
