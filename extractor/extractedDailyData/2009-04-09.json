  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis remarkable picture of a slender crescent Venus\nwas made during\n<a href=\"ap070620.html\">daylight hours</a> on March 26.\n\nVenus was then very near\n<a href=\"http://transientsky.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/venus/\">inferior\nconjunction</a>, its closest approach\nto a point on a line directly\n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/astro/cosmos/\nI/Inferior+Planet\">between Earth and the Sun</a>.\n\nSo, daylight was a good time to <i>carefully</i>\nrecord the telescopic view when both\n<a href=\"http://www.ancientstarlight.com/Venus_Conjunctions.html\">Venus\nand Sun</a> were high in the daytime sky.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/\n41202957.html\">Near inferior conjunction</a>, Venus is closest\nto us and at its largest <a href=\"ap040521.html\">apparent size</a>,\nbut Venus is also strongly backlit by sunlight, presenting\nits night side partially outlined by a narrow crescent.\n\nWhat makes the image remarkable are the faint arcs extending\nbeyond the sunlit crescent around to the night side of Venus,\ndue to sunlight filtering through the planet's\n<a href=\"ap080226.html\">dense atmosphere</a>.\n\nAstronomer Eddie Guscott reports from his site in Essex, England\nthat the faint extensions came and went as the Earth's atmospheric\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUw8WtR_7us\">blurring\nchanged</a>.\n\nHis image was constructed from 85 of the sharpest frames\nchosen from thousands taken with a webcam and telescope.",
