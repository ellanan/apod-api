  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nEven from the top of a volcanic crater, this vista was unusual.  \n\nFor one reason,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a> was dazzlingly\nbright two weeks ago, when this picture was taken, as\n<a href=\"ap080714.html\">it</a> was nearing its brightest time of the entire year.\n\n<a href=\"ap100129.html\">Mars</a>, on the far upper left,\nis the brightest object in the above picture.  \n\nThe brightness of the\n<a href=\"http://seds.org/~spider/spider/Mars/mars2010.html\">red planet</a> peaked last week near when Mars reached\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(planets)\">opposition</a>, the time when Earth and Mars are closest together in their orbits.\n\nArching across the lower part of the image is a rare lunar \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_bow\">fog bow</a>.\n\nUnlike a more commonly seen\n<a href=\"ap060702.html\">rainbow</a>,\nwhich is created by sunlight reflected\n<a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/prism/\">prism</a>atically\nby falling rain, this\n<a href=\"ap080529.html\">fog bow</a> was created by\n<a href=\"ap090810.html\">moonlight reflected</a> by the small water \ndrops that compose <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog\">fog</a>.\n\nAlthough most <a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3001972&amp;Sort=Photographer\">fog bows</a> appear white, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum\">all of the colors</a> \nof the rainbow were somehow visible here.  \n\nThe above image was taken from high atop\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakala\">Haleakala</a>,\na huge volcano in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii\">Hawaii</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.",
