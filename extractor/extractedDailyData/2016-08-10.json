  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill either of these galaxies survive? \n\nIn what might be dubbed as a semi-final round in a galactic elimination tournament, the two spirals of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7318\">NGC 7318</a> are colliding.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/astromet/28337999901/in/album-72157634385115181/\">featured picture</a> was created from images taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nWhen galaxies crash into each other, many things may happen including gravitational \n<a href=\"ap120930.html\">distortion</a>, gas condensing to produce \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...42F\">new episodes of star formation</a>, and ultimately the \n<a href=\"ap120604.html\">two galaxies combining</a> into one.\n\nSince these two galaxies are part of \n<a href=\"ap140327.html\">Stephan's Quintet</a>, \na final round of battling galaxies will likely \noccur over the next few billion years with the \neventual result of many scattered stars and one large galaxy.\n\nQuite possibly, the \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">remaining galaxy</a> \nwill not be easily identified with any of its initial galactic components. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVDq0C6qn-0\">Stephan's Quintet</a> was the first identified galaxy group, lies about 300 million light years away, and is \n<a href=\"http://www.thedistractionnetwork.com/images/smart-dogs-192.jpg\">visible through</a> a moderately-sized telescope \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gczyyDMnfKU\">toward</a> \nthe constellation of the Winged Horse \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(constellation)\">Pegasus</a>).",
