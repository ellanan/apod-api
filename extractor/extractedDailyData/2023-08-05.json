  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/0qzjt9/\">This pretty nebula</a>\nlies some 1,500 light-years away,\nits shape and color in this telescopic view\nreminiscent of a robin's egg.\n\nThe cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the\nboundaries of the southern constellation Fornax.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2395.html\">Recognized</a>\nas a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn't represent a beginning\nthough.\n\nInstead it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the\nevolution of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Mature_stars\">aging star</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10891\">In fact</a>,\nvisible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360\nis known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved\n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html\">white dwarf stars</a>,\nless massive but much hotter than the Sun. \n\nTheir intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has\nstripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually\nsurrounding gaseous shroud.\n\nThe predominant blue-green hue of NGC 1360 seen here is the\nstrong emission produced as electrons recombine with\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium\">doubly ionized oxygen atoms</a>.",
