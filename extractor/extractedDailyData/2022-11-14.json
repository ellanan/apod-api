  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat powers are being wielded in the Wizard Nebula? \n\nGravitation strong enough to form stars, and \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">stellar winds</a> \nand radiations powerful enough to create and dissolve \n<a href=\"ap221020.html\">towers of gas</a>. \n\nLocated only 8,000 light years away, the Wizard nebula, \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkWyWUEP8KB/\">featured here</a>, surrounds developing open star cluster \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7380\">NGC 7380</a>. \n\nVisually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that \n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/krusefeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Surprised-squirrel.jpg\">appears to some</a> like a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)#/media/File:Saluzzo-Castello_della_Manta-mago.jpg\">fictional medieval sorcerer</a>. \n\nThe active star forming region spans 100 about \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a>, making it appear larger than the \n<a href=\"https://lco.global/spacebook/sky/using-angles-describe-positions-and-apparent-sizes-objects/\">angular extent</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">Moon</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap140829.html\">Wizard Nebula</a> \ncan be located with a small telescope toward the constellation of the \nKing of Aethiopia \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_%28constellation%29\">Cepheus</a>). \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...71C/abstract\">nebula may last</a> only a few million years, \nsome of the stars being formed may outlive our Sun.",
