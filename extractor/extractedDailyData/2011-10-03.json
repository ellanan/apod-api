  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat if you could fly through the universe and see dark matter?\n\nWhile the technology for taking such a flight remains under development, the technology for visualizing such a  flight has taken a grand leap forward with the completion of the\n<a href=\"http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Movies.html\">Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation</a>.\n\nAfter 6 million <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU\">CPU</a> hours, the world's\n<a href=\"http://www.top500.org/list/2011/06/100\">seventh fastest supercomputer</a> output many scientific novelties including the\nabove flight simulation.\n\nStarting from the relatively smooth <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/dark_matter.html\">dark matter</a> distribution of the early universe discerned from the\n<a href=\"ap031231.html\">microwave background</a> and other large sky data sets, the Bolshoi tracked the universe's evolution to the present epoch shown above, given the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model\">standard concordance cosmology</a>.\n\nThe bright spots in the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2011/11-77AR.html\">above video</a> are all knots of normally invisible dark matter, many of which contain\n<a href=\"ap100911.html\">normal galaxies</a>.  \n\nLong filaments and\n<a href=\"ap100502.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>, all gravitationally dominated by dark matter, become evident.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1002.3660K\">Statistical comparison</a> between the Bolshoi and current real sky maps of actual galaxies show\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/28674578\">good agreement</a>.\n\nAlthough the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFgpi9qj46s#!\">Bolshoi simulation</a> bolsters the existence of dark matter, many questions about our universe remain, including the composition of dark matter, the nature of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a>, and how the\n<a href=\"ap070102.html\">first generation of stars</a> and galaxies formed.",
