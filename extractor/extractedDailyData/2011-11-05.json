  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nEarly in the\n<a href=\"http://www.aavso.org/vsots_gkper\">20th century, GK Persei</a>\nbriefly became one of the brightest stars in planet Earth's sky,\nan event known as Nova Persei 1901.\n\nDocumented in\n<a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/\ngkper.shtml\">this modern day composite</a> of two images\nfrom 2003 and 2011 the ejecta from the explosion,\npopularly called the Firework Nebula, continues to expand into space.\n\nThese images are part of a\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/31120259\">time lapse video</a>\ntracking the nebula's expansion over the last 17 years.\n\nAbout 1500 light-years away, the nebula is still just under\na light-year in diameter.\n\nGK Per and similar\n<a href=\"ap091117.html\">cataclysmic variable stars</a> known as\nclassical novae are understood to be binary\nsystems consisting of a compact\n<a href=\"ap060726.html\">white dwarf star and\nswollen cool giant star</a> in a close orbit.\n\nThe build up of mass transferred to the surface of the\nwhite dwarf from the giant star through an accretion disk\neventually triggers a thermonuclear outburst, blasting\nthe stellar material into space without destroying the\nwhite dwarf star.\n\nWith a 2 day orbital period, the\n<a href=\"ap980704.html\">GK Per system</a> has produced\nmuch smaller outbursts\n<a href=\"http://www.aavso.org/node/1555/3095\">in recent years</a>.",
