  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWelcome to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary#Latin-derived_numerical_names\">quindecennial</a> year of the Astronomy Picture of the Day!\n\nPerhaps a source of web consistency for some,\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap_faq.html\">APOD</a> is still here.  \n\nAs during each of the 15 years of selecting images, writing text, and editing the\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a> web pages, the occasionally industrious Robert Nemiroff (left) and frequently persistent Jerry Bonnell (right) are pictured above plotting to highlight yet another unsuspecting image of our cosmos.\n\nAlthough the above image may appear similar to the whimsical\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermeer\">Vermeer</a> composite that ran on\n<a href=\"ap000616.html\">APOD's fifth anniversary</a>, a perceptive eye might catch that this year it has been digitally re-pixelated using many of the\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/1006/thumbnails.zip\">over 5,000 APOD images</a> that have \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html\">appeared</a> over APOD's tenure.  \n\n(Can you find any notable APOD images?)\n\nOnce again, we at APOD would like to offer a sincere thank you to our readership for  continued interest, support, and many gracious <a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/discuss_apod.php?date=100616\">communications</a>.",
