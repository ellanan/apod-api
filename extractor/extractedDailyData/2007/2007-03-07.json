  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n A new spacecraft is headed for the outer Solar System.  \n\nNamed <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/mission/mission_timeline.html\">New Horizons</a>, this robotic explorer passed Jupiter last week after being \n<a href=\"ap060124.html\">launched</a> only in early 2006.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a> is being \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_slingshot\">pulled</a> \nby Jupiter's gravity to a greater speed toward its next target: \n<a href=\"ap060903.html\">Pluto</a> in 2015.\n\nDuring its \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/\">encounter with Jupiter</a>, \nNew Horizons was able to capture new images of many \n<a href=\"ap070211.html\">Jovian moons</a>, Jupiter's complex and \n<a href=\"ap001123.html\">ever-changing atmosphere</a>, and Jupiter's \n<a href=\"ap060505.html\">Little Red Spot</a>, \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/missionPhotos/pages/022807_3.html\">pictured above</a>.\n\nFormed over the past few years from several smaller storms, Jupiter's \n<a href=\"ap060725.html\">Little Red Spot survived</a> \na near miss with Jupiter's better-known \n<a href=\"ap990806.html\">Great Red Spot</a> last year.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/missionPhotos/pages/022807_3.html\">above image</a> of Jupiter covers over twice the diameter of the \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">Earth</a>.",
