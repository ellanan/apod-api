  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nYou don't have to be at \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/\">Yellowstone</a> \nto see a sky this beautiful, but it helps.\n\nOnly at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone\">Yellowstone National Park</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming\">Wyoming</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>, would you see the picturesque foreground of the famous \n<a href=\"http://www.yellowstoneparknet.com/old_faithful/old_faithful_faqs.php\">Old Faithful Geyser</a> erupting in front an already picturesque sky.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful_Geyser\">Old Faithful Geyser</a>, \nvisible in the foreground, is seen \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPt6FZzriXQ\">propelling a stream of hot water</a>\nover 30 meters in the air.  This happens predictably for a few minutes about every 90 minutes.  \n\nAlso predictable are the brightest orbs that populate the nighttime sky, although those visible at any one time keep changing.  \n\nVisible far in the background sky of this mid-July image are the plane of our \n<a href=\"ap050605.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> on the left, and the bright planet \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">Jupiter</a> on the right.  \n\nJupiter is the brightest celestial object in the entire image.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.zeitcam.com/webcam/oldfaithful/\">Old Faithful</a> has been erupting at least since the late 1800s.",
