  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis image of Saturn could not have been taken from Earth. \n\nNo <a href=\"ap000701.html\">Earth</a> based picture could possibly view the night side of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a> and the corresponding \n<a href=\"ap061016.html\">shadow</a> cast across Saturn's rings. \n\nSince Earth is much closer to the Sun than Saturn, \nonly the day side of the planet is visible from the Earth. \n\nIn fact, <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08362\">this image mosaic</a> was taken in January by the robotic \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn.   \n\nThe beautiful rings of Saturn are seen in full expanse, while \n<a href=\"ap051010.html\">cloud details</a> are visible near the night-day \n<a href=\"ap050611.html\">terminator</a> divide.",
