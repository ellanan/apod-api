  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's that new star in the sky?  \n\nThe star might appear new, but it's actually just the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/mira.html\">variable star Mira</a> \nnear its brightest.  \n\nRolling your cursor over the above vertically compressed \n<a href=\"image/0702/mira_seip_big.jpg\">image</a> will identify the unusual star \n<a href=\"ap060722.html\">Mira</a>, a star that can change from practical invisibility to one of the brighter stars on the sky over the course of a year.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.photomeeting.de/astromeeting/constellations/070215mira1024.htm\">Pictured above</a> a castle in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart\">Stuttgart</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>,  last week, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant\">red giant</a> star \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Mira_variable.html\">Mira</a> appeared near its maximum brightness of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude\">magnitude</a> 2.\n\nAlthough similar in mass to our Sun, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira\">Mira</a> tenuous and cool \natmosphere could extend out past the orbit of Mars, and achieve a \nluminosity over 10,000 times greater than our Sun.\n\nMira is near the end of its life and its variability is somewhat erratic.  \n\nDetails of Mira's variability are still \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004MNRAS.352..318I\">being researched</a>, but the reason for Mira's pulsations are \nthought related to periodic changes in the thickness of parts of Mira's atmosphere. \n\nRecent <a href=\"ap010121.html\">high resolution images</a> show that \nMira is not even round. \n\n\nMira lies 420 \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> distant toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of the Monster Whale \n(<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cet/index.html\">Cetus</a>).\n\n<a href=\"http://isi.ssl.berkeley.edu/aavso_mira_information.htm\">Mira</a> \nwill fade over the next 200 days, but climb back to naked-eye visibility early next year.",
