  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow do we know that dark matter isn't just normal matter exhibiting strange gravity?  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0709a.html\">new observation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://astro.berkeley.edu/~jcohn/lens.html\">gravitationally magnified</a> \nfaint galaxies far in the distance behind a massive cluster of galaxies is \nshedding new dark on the subject.   \n\nThe  <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/17/image/\">above detailed image</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nindicates that a huge ring of dark matter likely exists surrounding the \ncenter of CL0024+17 that has no normal matter counterpart. \n\nWhat is visible in the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/17/image/a/format/zoom/\">above image</a>, first and foremost, \nare many spectacular galaxies that are part of \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2007/05/15/hubble-finds-dark-matter-smoke-ring/\">CL0024+17 itself</a>, typically appearing tan in color.  \n\nNext, a close inspection of the cluster center shows \n<a href=\"ap040807.html\">several unusual and repeated galaxy shapes</a>, \ntypically more blue.  \n\nThese are <a href=\"ap040627.html\">multiple images</a> of a few distant galaxies, \nshowing that the cluster is a \n<a href=\"ap070311.html\">strong gravitational lens</a>.  \n\nIt is the relatively \n<a href=\"ap000315.html\">weak distortions</a> of the many distant \nfaint blue galaxies all over the image, however, that indicates the existence of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter\">dark matter</a> ring.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.computersciencelab.com/ComputerHistory/HtmlHelp/Images2/eniac1.jpg\">computationally modeled</a> dark matter ring spans about five million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> \nand been digitally superimposed to the image in diffuse blue.  \n\nA hypothesis for the formation of the huge dark matter \n<a href=\"ap060625.html\">ring</a> holds that it is a transient feature formed when galaxy cluster CL0024+17 collided with another cluster of galaxies about one billion years ago, \nleaving a ring similar to when a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFdiNzPoTU\">rock is thrown</a> in a pond.",
