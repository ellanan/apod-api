  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDust pillars are like \n<a href=\"ap070218.html\">interstellar mountains</a>.  \n\nThey survive because they are more dense than their \nsurroundings, but they are being slowly \n<a href=\"http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/pugetsound/tips/erosion.html\">eroded away</a> by a hostile environment.  \n\nVisible in the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1999/42/\">above picture</a> is the end of a \nhuge gas and dust pillar in the \n\n<a href=\"ap070813.html\">Trifid Nebula</a>, \npunctuated by a smaller pillar pointing up and an unusual \n<a href=\"ap970619.html\">jet</a> pointing to the left.  \n\nThe pink dots are newly formed low-mass stars.\n\nA star near the small pillar's end is slowly being stripped of its \n<a href=\"ap060528.html\">accreting gas</a> by radiation from a tremendously brighter star \nsituated off the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1999/42/\">above picture</a> to the upper right.  \n\nThe jet extends nearly a \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-year</a> and would \nnot be visible without external illumination.  \n\nAs gas and <a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> evaporate from the pillars, \nthe hidden stellar source of this \n\n<a href=\"ap990211.html\">jet</a> will likely be uncovered, \npossibly over the next 20,000 years.",
