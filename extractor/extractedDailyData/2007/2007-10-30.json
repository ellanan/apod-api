  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGo outside tonight and see \n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/10775326.html\">Comet Holmes</a>.\n\nNo binoculars or telescopes are needed -- just \n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Curious_kitten.jpg\">curiosity</a> and a \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/images2007/24oct07/skymap_north_holmes.gif\">sky map</a>.  \n\nLast week, \n<a href=\"ap071026.html\">Comet 17P/Holmes</a> underwent an \nunusual outburst that vaulted it unexpectedly from obscurity into \none of the brightest comets in recent years.\n\n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">Sky enthusiasts</a> \nfrom the northern hemisphere have been following the \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_holmes.html\">comet's \nprogress</a> closely. \n\nIn\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_holmes_page4.htm\">\nthis animation</a> recorded from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec\">Quebec</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/coma.html&amp;edu=high\">coma</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2007/10/28/comet-17p-holmes-update/\">Comet Holmes</a> is seen noticeably expanding over the past few days.  \n\n<a href=\"ap050911.html\">Jupiter</a> has been placed artificially nearby to \nallow for a comparison of \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html\">angular sizes</a>\nand scaled to the size it would appear at the current location of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17P/Holmes\">Comet Holmes</a>.\n\nHow <a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/017p.html\">Comet Holmes will further evolve</a> is unknown, \nwith one possibility being that the expanding gas cloud that started from its \n<a href=\"ap071029.html\">recent outburst</a> will slowly disperse and fade.",
