  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLight-years in length, this cosmic tornado is actually\na powerful jet cataloged as HH (Herbig-Haro) 49/50 blasting\ndown from the top of a\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/mediaimages/\nsig/sig06-002.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope view</a>.\n\nThough such\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n1995/24/astrofile/\">energetic outflows</a> are\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/shst2/ballyj.html\">well\nknown</a> to be associated with the formation of\n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/images_ysos.html\">young\nstars</a>, the exact cause of the spiraling structures apparent in\nthis case is still mysterious.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/\nStarForm.html\">embryonic star</a>\nresponsible for the 100-kilometer per second\njet is located just off the top of the picture, while the bright\nstar seen near the tip of the jet may just by chance lie\nalong the line of sight.\n\nIn the false-color <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\nlight_lessons/our_world_different_light/astronomy.html\">infrared</a>\nimage, the tornado glows \nwith infrared light generated as the outflow heats surrounding\n<a href=\"ap060130.html\">dust clouds</a>.\n\nThe color coding shows a trend from red to blue hues at the tornado's\ntip indicating a systematic increase in emission at shorter wavelengths.\n\nThe trend is thought to indicate an increase in molecular excitation\ncloser to where the head of the jet is impacting\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu//cosmic_classroom/\nir_tutorial/ism.html\">interstellar</a> gas.\n\nHH49/50 is about 450 light-years distant, located in the\n<a href=\"ap020609.html\">Chamaeleon</a> I molecular cloud.",
