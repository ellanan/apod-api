  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are there dark spots on the sun?\n\nAlthough noted for thousands of years, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot\">sunspots</a> \nhave been known for decades to be regions of the Sun that are \nslightly depressed and cooled by the Sun's complex and changing \n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/Magnetic/what.html\">magnetic field</a>.\n\nHigh resolution pictures like the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/solar-b/solar_018.html\">above image</a> from Japan's new Sun-watching \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinode\">Hinode satellite</a>, \nhowever, are helping to increase modern understanding. \n\nIn the center of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/solar-b/solar_018.html\">above image</a> \nis a sunspot, but not seen in the usual orientation --this \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/sunspots/\">sunspot</a> is seen sideways.  \n\nOf particular interest is \n<a href=\"ap060611.html\">erupting glowing gas</a> \nthat shows how the Sun's magnetic field comes \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mov/171957main_Roll_In_FOUR_Limb_Flare_Vid1.mov\">right out</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/feature1.shtml\">spot</a> center, \nbut curves markedly around the spot edges.  \n\nBetter <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/mar/HQ_07072_Hinode_Images_of_Sun.html\">understanding</a> of how the Sun ejects particles into space may result in more accurate predictions of \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/news/stereo_astronauts.html\">solar storms that affect</a> satellites, astronauts, and even power grids on Earth.",
