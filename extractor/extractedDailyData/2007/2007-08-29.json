  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen a gigantic jet?  \n\nThey are extremely rare but tremendously powerful.\n\n<a href=\"http://band.unk.edu/src/naturearticle.html\">Gigantic jets</a> \nare a newly discovered type of lightning discharge between some \n<a href=\"ap041007.html\">thunderstorms</a> and the Earth's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere\">ionosphere</a> high above them.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.okdig.com/images.net/astro/20070820/M20070820_092538_stealth_stP.jpg\">Pictured above</a><a> is one such jet caught by accident by a meteor camera in \n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma\">Oklahoma</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America\">USA</a>.  \n\nThe gigantic jet, at the lower left, traversed perhaps 70 kilometers in just under one second.  \n\nClicking on the image will bring up a movie in many browsers, also visible \n<a href=\"http://www.okdig.com/images.net/astro/20070820/20070820_sprites.wmv\">here</a>.\n\nGigantic jets are much different from regular cloud-to-cloud and \n<a href=\"ap040818.html\">cloud-to-ground lightning</a>.\n\nThe bottoms of gigantic jets appear similar in appearance to another type \n<a href=\"ap990616.html\">cloud-to-ionosphere strike</a> called \n<a href=\"http://elf.gi.alaska.edu/\">blue jets</a>, while the tops appear similar to \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning\">upper-atmosphere</a> \n<a href=\"ap951111.html\">red sprites</a>.\n\nAlthough the mechanism and \n<a href=\"ap060814.html\">trigger</a> that causes gigantic jets is a topic of research, \nit is clear that the jets reduce charge imbalance between different parts of Earth's atmosphere.  \n\nA good way to look for \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFMAE11A..02F\">gigantic jets</a> is to watch a powerful but distant thunderstorm from a clear location.",
