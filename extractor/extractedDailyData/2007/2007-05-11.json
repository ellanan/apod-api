  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe silhouette of an intriguing\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_nebula\">dark nebula</a>\ninhabits this cosmic scene, based on images from the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html\">Palomar\nObservatory Sky Survey</a>.\n\nLynds' Dark Nebula\n(<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/\nnebula-catalog/ldn.html\">LDN</a>) 1622 appears against a faint background\nof glowing hydrogen gas only easily seen in long telescopic\nexposures of the region.\n\nLDN 1622 lies near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy,\nclose <a href=\"ap030404.html\">on the sky</a> to\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/b-loop.html\">Barnard's\nLoop</a> - a large cloud surrounding the rich\n<a href=\"ap070125.html\">complex of emission nebulae</a> found\nin the Belt and Sword\n<a href=\"http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/Education/OrionTourCenter/\noptical.html\">of Orion</a>.\n\nBut the obscuring dust of LDN 1622 is thought to be much closer\nthan Orion's more famous nebulae, perhaps only 500 light-years away.\n\nAt that distance, this 1 degree wide field of view\nwould span less than 10 light-years.",
