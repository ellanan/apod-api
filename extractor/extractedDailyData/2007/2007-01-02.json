No one is yet sure.  \n\n<a href=\"sun.html\">Our Sun</a> is not a \nfirst-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_I_stars\">generation</a>\nstar.  \n\nIt is not even second generation.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap030610.html\">first stars</a> to appear in the universe \nlikely came and went about 13 billion years ago.\n\nHowever,\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2006-22/\nrelease.shtml\">deep observations</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space\nTelescope</a> \nin <a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a> \nhave detected a diffuse glow, possibly from first generation stars \nhundreds of times more massive than our Sun.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2006-22/\nssc2006-22a.shtml\">above image</a> shows infrared background light with \nbright patches that might have originated from clusters of these\nfirst objects.    \n\nGray areas depict places where nearby foreground stars from our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nwere digitally removed.",
