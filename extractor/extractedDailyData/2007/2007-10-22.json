  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nScroll right to see the largest crater yet visited by a rover on Mars.  \n\nReaching the expansive \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_crater\">Victoria Crater</a> \nhas been a \n<a href=\"ap060605.html\">goal</a> for the \n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">robotic Opportunity rover</a> rolling across \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> for the past two years.  \n\nVictoria crater has about five times the diameter of \n<a href=\"ap040510.html\">Endurance Crater</a>, which Opportunity spent six months exploring.  \n\nOpportunity reached Victoria last year,\nand was cautiously probing the edges of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium\">stadium</a>-sized \ncrevice while waiting for large \n<a href=\"ap070725.html\">dust storms</a> to clear.  \n\nA safe path was found, and \n<a href=\"ap070917.html\">Opportunity has slowly entered</a> into\nVictoria Crater.\n\nIt is hoped that Victoria Crater will show a \n<a href=\"ap041115.html\">deep stack of layers</a> uncovered by\nthe initial impact, \nand hence new clues into the ancient surface history of Mars.\n\nVisible in the distance in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10007\">above mosaic</a> \nis the far rim of Victoria Crater, lying about 800 meters away and rising about \n70 meters above the crater floor.   \n\nThe alcove in front has been dubbed \n<a href=\"http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/Duck_Bay_Victoria_Crater_Planet_Mars_999.html\">Duck Bay</a>.",
