  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nNo natural clouds appear in this picture.  \n\nOn the left, an airplane cruises through the atmosphere leaving a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail\">contrail</a> in its wake.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap041013.html\">contrail</a> would normally appear white, \nbut the large volume of air toward the setting Sun preferentially \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html\">knocks away blue light</a>, giving the reflected trail a bright orange hue.  \n\nFar in the distance, to the right of the plane, is the \n<a href=\"ap050513.html\">young Moon</a>.  \n\nThis vast world shows only a sliver of itself because the Sun is nearly lined up behind it. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://vjac.free.fr/skyshows/conjunctions/17mai2007/slides/0148.html\">above image</a> is framed by an eerie gray sky, \ntoo far from day to be blue, too far from night to be black.  \n\nWithin minutes the \n<a href=\"http://vjac.free.fr/skyshows/conjunctions/17mai2007/index.html\">impromptu sky show</a> ended.  \n\nThe plane crossed the Moon.  The contrail dispersed.  The Sun set.  The Moon set.  \n\nThe sky faded to black, only to \n<a href=\"ap070508.html\">reveal thousands of stars</a> that had been hiding below the gray din.",
