  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSurprising Comet Holmes remains easily visible\nas a round, fuzzy cloud in the northern constellation\n<a href=\"ap071026.html\">Perseus</a>.\n\nSkywatchers with telescopes, binoculars, or those that\njust decide to look up\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_holmes_page7.htm\">can\nenjoy</a> the solar system's latest\nprodigy as <a href=\"http://www.shadowandsubstance.com/\">it glides</a>\nabout 150 million kilometers from Earth, beyond the orbit of Mars.\n\n<a href=\"ap071030.html\">Still expanding</a>,\nHolmes now appears to be about 1/3 the\nsize of the Full Moon, and many observers report a\nyellowish tint to the dusty\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/comet_worldbook.html\">coma</a>.\n\nA golden color does dominate this\n<a href=\"http://dg-imaging.astrodon.com/gallery/\ndisplay.cfm?imgID=104\">telescopic view</a> recorded on November 1,\nshowing variations across the coma's bright central region.\n\nBut where's the comet's tail?\n\nLike any good\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/017p.html\">comet, Holmes'</a>\ntail would tend to point away from the Sun.\n\nThat direction is nearly along our line-of-sight behind the comet,\nmaking its tail very difficult to see.",
