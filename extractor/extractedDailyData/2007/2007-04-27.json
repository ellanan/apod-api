  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOne of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky and similar in size\nto the <a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way</a>,\nbig, beautiful <a href=\"ap060707.html\">spiral M81</a>\nlies 11.8 million light-years away\nin the northern constellation Ursa Major.\n\n<a href=\"http://astrophoto.com/M81LRGBDEEP.htm\">This remarkably deep image</a>\nof the region reveals details in the bright\nyellow core, but at the\nsame time follows fainter features along the galaxy's gorgeous blue\nspiral arms and\nsweeping dust lanes.\n\nAbove M81 lies a dwarf companion galaxy,\n<a href=\"http://seds.org/MESSIER/more/m081_hom9.html\">Holmberg IX</a>,\nsporting a large,\n<a href=\"ap061123.html\">pinkish star-forming</a>\nregion near the top.\n\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu//cosmic_classroom/\nmultiwavelength_astronomy/multiwavelength_museum/m81.html\">While M81</a>\nand Holmberg IX are seen through a foreground of stars in our\nown Milky Way galaxy, they\nare also seen here through a much fainter complex of dust clouds.\n\nThe relatively <a href=\"ap050929.html\">unexplored clouds</a>\nare likely only some hundreds of light-years distant and lie high\nabove our galaxy's plane.\n\nScattered through the image, especially at the the right, the dust\nclouds reflect the combined light of the\nMilky Way's stars and have been dubbed\n<a href=\"http://www.galaxyimages.com/UNP_IFNebula.html\">integrated\nflux nebulae</a>.",
