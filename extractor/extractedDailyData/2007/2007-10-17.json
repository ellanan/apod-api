  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHow old is this galaxy?  \n\nThe galaxy on the left, \n<a href=\"ap041203.html\">I Zwicky 18</a>, \nwas once thought to be one of the youngest galaxies on record \nsince its bright stars indicated an age of only 500 million years.  \n\nThe galaxy was also intriguing because it resembled \n<a href=\"ap070910.html\">galaxies forming</a> in the very early universe, \nbut mysterious since it is so nearby -- only 59 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light\nyears</a> away -- and surrounded by galaxies that are significantly older.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0716a.html\">Recent\nimages</a> of I Zwicky 18 by the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nhave helped resolve this mystery, discovering a population of \n<a href=\"ap060520.html\">old faint stars</a> intermixed with the \n<a href=\"ap060501.html\">bright star</a> population.\n\nTherefore \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Zwicky_18\">I Zwicky 18</a>\nis now thought to be just as old as its neighbors,\nroughly 10 billion years old, \nbut with an intense episode of relative \n<a href=\"ap060226.html\">new star formation</a>.\n\nPossibly the trigger for this recent episode of bright star formation \nis the changing gravitational influence of  \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...667L.151A\">I Zwicky\n18</a>'s smaller companion galaxy, visible at the upper right.",
