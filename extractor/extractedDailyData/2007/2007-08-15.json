  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are they?\n\nFive streaks near the bottom of the above image taken near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara\">Ankara</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a> \non Sunday would be identified at first glance as meteors from the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/11jul_greatperseids.htm\">Perseids meteor shower</a> peaking just that night.  \n\nUnexpectedly, however, these streaks do not point back to the Perseids \n<a href=\"ap070812.html\">radiant</a> in \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/perseus.html\">Perseus</a>. \n\nTheir origin is therefore somewhat unclear.  \n\nThe above image was captured over the time span of 40 minutes.  \n\nOther visible celestial icons include the constellation \n<a href=\"ap070203.html\">Orion</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap060109.html\">Pleiades star cluster</a>. \n\nOne hypothesis is that the \n<a href=\"ap061023.html\">streaks</a> are part of a microburst from a \nmuch less active meteor shower known as the \n<a href=\"http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/alpha_ursa_majorids.html\">Alpha Ursae Majorids</a>.\n\nAnother possibility is that they are parts of a \n<a href=\"http://www.reentrynews.com/2007023b.html\">satellite</a> \nthat broke up as it \n<a href=\"ap000603.html\">re-entered</a> the Earth's atmosphere.  \n\nA discussion of these possibilities can be found \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?p=87509\">here</a>.\n\nThis year's\n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/live/perseids2007/\">Perseids meteor shower</a> \nwas a good one, as it was particularly active and \ncorresponded with the dark skies that come with a \n<a href=\"ap050513.html\">new moon</a>.",
