  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow would it look to have four suns in the sky?\n\nPlanets of the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/happenings/20070724/\">HD 98800 system</a>, \nif they exist, would experience such a view.  \n\nHD 98800 is a  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_star\">multiple star system</a> \nabout 150 light years from Earth -- right in our section of the \n<a href=\"http://cassfos02.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nFor years it has been known that \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0380\">HD 98800</a> consists of two pairs of \n<a href=\"ap991002.html\">double stars</a>, \nwith one pair surrounded by a disk of dust.   \n\nThe star pairs are located about 50 \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/au.html\">AU</a> \nfrom each other -- in comparison just outside the orbit of \n<a href=\"ap060903.html\">Pluto</a>.  \n\nRecent data from the Earth-trailing\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> \nin <a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared</a> light, \nhowever, indicate that the dust disk has gaps that appear consistent with being \ncleared by planets orbiting in the disk.  \n\nIf so, one planet appears to be orbiting at a distance similar to Mars of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">our own Solar System</a>.  \n\nPictured \n<a href=\"http://gallery.spitzer.caltech.edu/Imagegallery/image.php?image_name=sig07-013\">above</a> is an artist's drawing of how the \n<a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v498n1/37029/sc0.html\">HD 98800 system</a> might appear to a nearby observer.",
