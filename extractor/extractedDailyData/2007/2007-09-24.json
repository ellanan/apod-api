  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHow do stars form?  \n\nTo help study this complex issue, astronomers took a \ndeep image in infrared light of an active part of our \n<a href=\"http://cassfos02.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nwhere star formation is rampant.  \n\nIn IRDC G11.11-0.11, thick clouds of \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> and gas are congealing into stars \nthat are so dark that humans living there would see an empty night sky.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2006-20/\nssc2006-20a.shtml\">The image</a>, though, taken last year by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope\">Spitzer\nSpace Telescope</a> in <a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/\nimagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a>, \nshows vast glowing fields of gas and dust, \nindicating that much of this dust is heated by forming stars.  \n\nThe centers of some clouds, such as the \n<a href=\"ap050521.html\">snake-like structure</a> \non the upper left, are so thick and cold that they are dark even in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared\">infrared light</a>.\n\nMany of the red dots are glowing \n<a href=\"ap030816.html\">dust shrouds</a> \ncentered on very young newly formed stars.  \n\nThe unusual red sphere below the snake is actually a \n<a href=\"ap051226.html\">supernova remnant</a>, \nthe glowing shell of a young star so massive it evolved rapidly and exploded.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2006-20/\nssc2006-20a.shtml\">The region</a> spans about 150 light years and\nlies about 10,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> \naway toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/\narticle.php?articleid=72\">constellation of Sagittarius</a>.",
