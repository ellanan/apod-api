  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over the South Pole of Venus?  \n\nTo find out, scientists sent the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEMBD3808BE_0.html\">robot Venus Express spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html\">Venus</a> \ndirectly over the lower spin axis of Earth's overheated twin.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Express\">Venus Express</a> \nconfirmed there a spectacular massive swirling storm system with \nsimilarities to the \n<a href=\"ap061113.html\">vortex recently imaged over Saturn's South Pole</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEMUTYNFGLE_0.html\">above composite image</a> in \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a> features Venus' daytime side on the left, \nshining primarily by reflected sunlight, and nighttime side on the right, \nshining primarily by \n<a href=\"http://tes.asu.edu/MARS_SURVEYOR/MGSTES/TIR_description.html\">thermal light</a>.  \n\nA Venusian polar vortex is visible as \nthe small circular feature near the center of the thermal infrared image pictured on the right.  \n\nClose inspection of \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMYGQEFWOE_index_0.html\">other South Pole images</a> unexpectedly showed a second vortex, \nmeaning that the unusual swirling clouds are like an \n<a href=\"ap040915.html\">Earth-hurricane</a> that has two eyes.\n\nWhy a double vortex has formed is now a topic of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006IAUJD..10E...8S\">research</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEMUTYNFGLE_0.html\">above image</a> was taken last year, and \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esa-mmg/mmg.pl?mission=Venus+Express&amp;type=I\">more recent images</a> from Venus Express \nare being processed that have as much as 100 times more detail.",
