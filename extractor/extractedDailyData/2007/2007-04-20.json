  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nCould this be a picture of the Earth and Moon\n<a href=\"ap030526.html\">from space</a>?\n\nIt certainly looks like it at first glance, with a cratered Moon \nstanding off from planet Earth's lovely blue disk\nsurrounded by a nurturing\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Topics/\natmosphere.html\">atmosphere</a>.\n\nIn fact, this\n<a href=\"http://www.arounder.eu/pantheon/pantheon.html\">view looks</a>\nup into the dome of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome\">ancient Pantheon</a>\nin Rome.\n\nThe Earth's blue disk is really the daytime sky with clouds seen\nthrough a nine meter diameter central opening in the dome.\n\nThe circular opening, or oculus, was intended as the\nsource of light for the building's interior.\n\nThe Moon is actually direct sunlight streaming through the oculus\nonto the dome's inner ribbed structure.\n\nHistorian Soeren Dalsgaard snapped\n<a href=\"http://www.dalsgaard.eu/Pantheon/index.html\">the evocative\npicture</a> in February and\ncomments that for almost two thousand years the rays of the Sun have traced a\nsteady path on the inside of\n<a href=\"http://www.dalsgaard.eu/Pantheon/Pantheon2.html\">the\nPantheon's</a> cupola.\n\nA testament to Roman architecture and engineering,\n<a href=\"http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2005/12/\nimperium_in_the_pantheon_in_ro.html\">the Pantheon's</a> dome\nis said to symbolize the vault of the heavens.",
