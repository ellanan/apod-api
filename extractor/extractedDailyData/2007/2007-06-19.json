  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_%28dwarf_planet%29 \">Eris</a>, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a> \ncurrently orbiting the Sun at about twice Pluto's distance, \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/24\">has\nbeen measured</a> \nto have about 27 percent more mass than Pluto.  \n\nThe mass was calculated by timing the orbit of Eris' moon \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysnomia_(moon)\">Dysnomia</a>.  \n\nImages taken with a ground-based \n<a href=\"ap971227.html\">Keck telescope</a>,\nwhen combined with existing images taken by \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>,\nshow that Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days.  \n\nCataloged as 2003 UB313 only a year ago, \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared images</a> also showed previously that Eris is actually\nlarger in diameter than <a href=\"ap060903.html\">Pluto</a>.  \n\nThe plane of Eris' orbit is well out of the plane of the \n<a href=\"http://nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>'s planets.  \n\nIn the above drawing, a scientific artist has imagined Eris and Dysnomia orbiting our distant Sun. \n\nNo space missions are currently planned to Eris, although the robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a> spacecraft bound for \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/faqs.php\">Pluto</a> has recently  \n<a href=\"ap070307.html\">passed Jupiter</a>.",
