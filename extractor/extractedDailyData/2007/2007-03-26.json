  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are bullets of gas shooting out of the Orion Nebula?\n\nNobody is yet sure.  \n\nFirst discovered in 1983, each bullet is actually about the size of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system\">our Solar System</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000MNRAS.315...11L\">moving at about 400 km/sec</a> from a central source dubbed IRc2.  \n\nThe age of the bullets, which can be found from their speed and distance from \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...534..976N\">IRc2</a>, is very young -- typically less than 1,000 years.\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4526819805867391097\">bullets rip</a> through the interior of the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m042.html\">Orion Nebula</a>, \na small percentage of iron gas causes the tip of each bullet to glow blue, \nwhile each bullet leaves a tubular pillar that glows by the light of heated hydrogen gas.   \n\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/bullets\">Pictured above</a>, the Orion bullets were captured in unprecedented detail by the adaptive optics technology of the Gemini North telescope.  \n\n<a href=\"ap061120.html\">M42</a>, the Orion Nebula, \nis the closest major star forming region to us and filled with changing \n<a href=\"ap070106.html\">dust, gas, and bright stars</a>.  \n\nThe Orion Nebula, is located about 1,500 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away and \n<a href=\"ap030207.html\">can be seen</a> with the unaided eye toward the \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/constellations/orion.html\">constellation of Orion</a>.",
