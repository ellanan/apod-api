  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's that cloud drifting in space?  \n\nIt's not an astronomical nebula -- those appear to stay put.  Atmospheric clouds don't look like this.  \n\nThe answer to last week's \n<a href=\"ap070222.html\">sky mystery</a> turned out to be \norbiting and expanding debris from the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronautix.com/craft/brizm.htm\">upper stage</a> of a \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceflightnow.com/proton/arabsat4a/\">failed Russian rocket</a> \nthat exploded unexpectedly.  \n\nThe cloud became visible to unaided southern hemisphere observers, \nand its cause was initially unknown.\n\nThe above time lapse movie shows the cloud drifting as seen from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>.  \n\nStreaks in and near the cloud are likely large pieces of debris.  \n\nThe debris cloud is more than an \n<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/health/astronomical-curiosity-a-must/2005/09/22/1126982153539.html?from=moreStories\">astronomical curiosity</a> -- particles from this \ncloud and others could become projectiles \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/multimedia/sts115/MMOD_impact.html\">damaging</a> existing satellites.   \n\nAs the <a href=\"http://members.ozemail.com.au/%7Eloomberah/themis.htm\">cloud disperses</a>, many particles will fall to Earth, but many more may help make low Earth orbit an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_cascade\">increasingly</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\">hostile</a> environment.",
