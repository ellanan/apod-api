  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Moon was up continuously for 14 days in August -- when viewed\nfrom <a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/cara/vtour/\">the South Pole</a>.\n\nBut during the total lunar eclipse on August 28, it circled\nonly about 10 degrees <a href=\"ap051125.html\">above the horizon</a>.\n\nFor Robert Schwarz, the resulting long line-of-sight through the\n<a href=\"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dpeach78/seeing2002.htm\">atmosphere\nthat blurred</a> his images was a minor\nproblem when he recorded this four hour long lunar\n<a href=\"ap070901.html\">eclipse sequence</a>.\n\nA more severe problem was the outdoor air temperature\nof -68 C (-90 F).\n\nThe extreme cold required him to\nmake the series of exposures through a slit in a window\nfrom inside a heated room.\n\nThough the heat produced <a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/\nconvection_currents.html\">convection</a> and further blurring,\nit was the only way to keep the camera\nat a reasonable operating temperature for an extended\nperiod of time.\n\nStill, he was rewarded with this impressive\nrecord of <a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/eclipses/\ngallery_28aug07_page4.htm\">August's lunar eclipse</a> from a\n<a href=\"http://www.antarctic-adventures.de/2007/spole07.html\">unique\nperspective</a> on\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">planet Earth</a>.",
