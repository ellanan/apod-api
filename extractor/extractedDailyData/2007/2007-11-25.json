  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would a cloud appear to be different colors?\n\nA relatively rare phenomenon known as\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/irid1.htm\">iridescent clouds</a> can show unusual colors vividly or a whole\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nemspectrum.html\">spectrum</a> of colors simultaneously.\n\nThese\n<a href=\"http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/weather/pricloud/\">clouds</a>\nare formed of small\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm\">water\ndroplets</a> of nearly uniform size.\n\nWhen the <a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> is in the\nright position and mostly hidden by thick clouds,\n<a href=\"http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/class/iredsnce.html\">these\nthinner clouds</a> significantly\n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction.html\">diffract</a>\nsunlight in a nearly coherent manner,\nwith different colors being deflected by different amounts.\n\nTherefore,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence\">different colors</a>\nwill come to the observer from slightly different directions.\n\nMany clouds start with uniform regions that could show\n<a href=\"http://www.meteoros.de/iris/irise.htm\">iridescence</a> but\nquickly become too thick, too mixed,\nor too far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors.\n\nThis iridescent cloud was photographed above\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder%2C_Colorado\">Boulder</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado\">Colorado</a> last week.",
