  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over the horizon?  \n\nMany a <a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky enthusiast</a> who thought they had \nseen it all had never seen anything like this.  \n\nTo the surprise of many Northern Hemisphere observers, the tail of \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006p1.html\">Comet McNaught</a> \nremained visible even after the comet's head set ahead of the Sun.  \n\nWhat's more, visible were bright but extremely rare \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AGM....14..P02B\">filamentary striae</a> from the comet's expansive dust tail.  \n\nThe cause of dust tail striae are not known for sure, but are possibly related to \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AGM....14..P02B\">fragmentation</a> \nof comet's nucleus.\n\nThe last comet to show \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999STIN...0073719S\">prominent striae</a> was \n<a href=\"ap050522.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> in 1997.\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_mcnaught_page13.htm\">Pictured above</a>, the tail of \n<a href=\"ap070122.html\">Comet McNaught</a> was caught just after sunset last Friday \nabove the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnic_Alps\">Carnic Alps</a> of northern \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>.",
