  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDoes this moon look familiar?  Possibly not, even though it is Earth's Moon.  \n\nLocked in synchronous rotation, the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html\">Moon</a> \nalways presents its well-known near side to Earth. \n\nBut from lunar orbit, \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/cover.html\">Apollo astronauts</a>\nalso grew to know the Moon's far side. \n\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/a16_m_3021.html\">This \nsharp picture</a> from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16\">Apollo 16</a>'s \nmapping camera shows the eastern edge of the \n<a href=\"ap040829.html\">familiar near side</a> (top) \nand the strange and heavily cratered \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Far_Side\">far side</a> of the Moon. \n\nSurprisingly, the rough and \n<a href=\"ap061210.html\">battered surface</a> of the far side \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon\">looks very different</a> \nfrom the near side which is covered with \n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/planet_volcano/lunar/mare/mlm.html\">smooth dark lunar maria</a>. \n\nThe likely explanation is that the \n<a href=\" ap950914.html\">far side</a> crust is thicker, \nmaking it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=800\">smooth maria</a>.",
