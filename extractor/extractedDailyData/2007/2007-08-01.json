  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does one half of Dione have more craters than the other?\n\nStart with the fact that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>'s moon Dione \nalways has one side that faces Saturn, and always has one side that faces away.  \n\nThis is similar to \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">Earth's Moon</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking\">tidal locking</a> \nmeans that one side of \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Dione\">Dione</a> always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit, \nwhile the other side always trails.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29\">Dione</a> \nshould therefore have undergone a significant amount of impacts on its leading half.\n\nBut the current leading half of \n<a href=\"ap060905.html\">Dione</a> \nis less cratered than the trailing half!  \n\nA possible explanation is that some impacts were so large they spun \n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2034.pdf\">Dione</a>, \nsometimes changing the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the \nmoon's spin again became locked.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08956\">Pictured above</a>, \nit is the top part of Dione that appears significantly more cratered than the bottom half.",
