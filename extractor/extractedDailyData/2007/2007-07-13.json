  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday, if it is clear, well placed New Yorkers can go outside at \nsunset and watch their city act like a modern version of Stonehenge.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\">Manhattan</a> will flood dramatically with \nsunlight just as the Sun sets precisely on the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/city_of_stars/19_sunset_34th.html\">centreline</a> of every street.  \n\nUsually, the tall buildings that line the gridded streets of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City\">New York City</a>'s tallest borough will hide the setting Sun.  \n\nThis effect makes <a href=\"ap970408.html\">Manhattan</a> \na type of modern \n<a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/h7.html\">Stonehenge</a>, \nalthough only aligned to about 30 \n<a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/trig/angle.html\">degrees</a> east of north.  \n\nWere <a href=\"http://home.nyc.rr.com/jkn/nysonglines/\">Manhattan</a>'s road grid perfectly aligned to east and west, \ntoday's effect would occur on the \n<a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/VernalEquinox.html\">Vernal</a> and \n\n<a href=\"ap030923.html\">Autumnal Equinox</a>, \nMarch 21 and September 21, the only two days that the \n<a href=\"ap040320.html\">Sun rises and sets due east and west</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://research.amnh.org/users/tyson/ManhattanSunset.php\">Pictured above</a> in this horizontally stretched image,\nthe Sun sets down\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Street\">34th Street</a> as\nviewed from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Avenue\">Park Avenue</a>.\n\nIf today's sunset is hidden by clouds \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TiryN8Lz10\">do not despair</a> -- the same thing happens twice each year, \nin late May and mid July.  \n\nOn none of these occasions, however, should you ever \nlook directly at the Sun.",
