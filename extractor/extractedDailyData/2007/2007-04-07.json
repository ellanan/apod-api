  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nUsing an image recorded just last month as a base,\nthis composite illustration tracks the\nmotion of <a href=\"ap070406.html\">bright Saturn</a> as it wanders\nthrough planet\n<a href=\"http://soc.jpl.nasa.gov/viewing.cfm\">Earth's night sky</a>.\n\nStarting at the upper right, Saturn's position is shown about\nevery two weeks beginning in August 2005 and projected\nthrough September 2008.\n\nOver the three year period, Saturn actually appears to reverse\nits general eastward (leftward) drift,\ntracing out three flattened curves.\n\nThe periodic backwards or\n<a href=\"ap060422.html\">retrograde motion</a> with\nrespect to the background stars is a\nreflection of the motion of the Earth itself.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/\nretrograd.html\">Retrograde motion</a> can be seen each time Earth overtakes\nand laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the\nEarth moving more rapidly through its own\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/retrograde/\ncopernican.html\">closer-in</a> orbit. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap060128.html\">Beehive</a> star cluster in Cancer\nlies near the track at the upper right.\n\nStars along the \"backward question mark\" at the head\n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/constellations/leo.html\">of Leo</a>\nare in the left half of the frame.\n\nSaturn's position\n<a href=\"http://skytonight.com/observing/home/April_podcast.html\">this\nmonth</a> is near the right hand limit \nof the middle curve.\n\nClick on the picture to download and view the gif animation.",
