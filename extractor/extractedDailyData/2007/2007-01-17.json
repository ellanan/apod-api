  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe brightest comet of recent decades was a surprising first sight for a new camera in space.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/\">Sun Earth Connection Coronal \nand Heliospheric Investigation</a> (SECCHI) instrument onboard the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO\">Solar TErrestrial \nRElations Observatory</a> (STEREO) satellite had just opened up \non January 11 when it snapped the above image of \n<a href=\"ap070115.html\">Comet McNaught</a>.  \n\nVisible was a spectacular view of the \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000825/\">Comet McNaught</a> \nbeing swept away from the Sun by the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/sun/wind.html\">solar wind</a> \nin filamentary rays.   \n\nThe comet tail is seen to extend at least seven degrees across the \n<a href=\"http://ares.nrl.navy.mil/sungrazer/index.php?p=latest_news\">above image</a>, while the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/coma.html\">central coma</a> is so bright it saturates.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2007/01/14/comet-mcnaught-daytime-comet/\">Comet McNaught</a> is now reportedly so bright that it is visible \neven in broad daylight by blocking out the Sun with your hand.   \n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006p1.html\">Comet McNaught</a> \nhas rounded the Sun and will slowly \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2006P1_1.html\">fade away</a> for observers in \n<a href=\"ap021222.html\">Earth's Southern Hemisphere</a> \nas it recedes from the Sun.",
