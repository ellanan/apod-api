  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHuge clusters of galaxies are surely colliding in Abell 520 but astrophysicists aren't sure why the dark matter is becoming separated from the normal matter.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/darkmatter.html\">dark matter</a> \nin the <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/a520/\">above multi-wavelength image</a>\nis shown in false blue, determined by carefully detailing how the \n<a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~hoekstra/lensing.html\">cluster distorts light</a> \nemitted by more distant galaxies.  \n\nVery hot gas, a form of normal matter, is shown in false red, determined by the \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/xrays.html\">X-rays</a> \ndetected by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>.  \n\nIndividual galaxies dominated by \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/209/may10/baryon.html\">normal matter</a> appear yellowish or white.  \n\nConventional wisdom holds that dark matter and normal matter are attracted the same gravitationally, and so should be distributed the same in \n<a href=\"http://www.saguaroastro.org/content/Abel-Galaxy-Clusters.htm\">Abell</a> 520.\n\nInspection of the \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/a520/\">above image</a>, \nhowever, shows a surprising a lack of a concentration of \n<a href=\"ap070719.html\">visible galaxies</a> along the dark matter.  \n\nOne hypothetical answer is that the discrepancy is caused by the \n<a href=\"ap070516.html\">large galaxies</a> \nundergoing some sort of conventional gravitational slingshots.   \n\nA more controversial hypothesis holds that the dark matter is colliding with itself in some non-gravitational way that has never been seen before.  \n\nFurther <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/a520/animations.html#cluster_merger\">simulations</a> and study of this cluster may resolve this scientific conundrum.",
