  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen six rainbows at once?  \n\nThey are not only rare to see -- they are a puzzle to understand.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow\">common rainbow</a> \nis caused by sunlight internally reflected by the backs of falling raindrops, while also being \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction\">refracted</a> at the air / water boundary.   \n\nTo see a rainbow, look opposite the Sun towards a rainstorm.   \n\nThis primary <a href=\"ap060702.html\">rainbow</a> is the brightest color swath in the \n<a href=\"http://epod.usra.edu/archive/epodviewer.php3?oid=275872\">above image</a>.  \n\nMultiple internal reflections inside water droplets sometimes make a \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/rbowpri.html\">secondary rainbow</a> to become visible outside the first, with colors reversed.  \n\nJust such a secondary rainbow is visible of the far left.  \n\n<a href=\"ap040913.html\">Harder to explain</a> is the intermediate rainbow, between the two.   \n\nThis rainbow is likely caused by sunlight that has first \n<a href=\"ap070718.html\">reflected off the lake</a> before striking the \ndistant raindrops that is reflecting sunlight back toward the observer.\n\nEach of these \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/bowim6.htm\">rainbows appear</a>s \nto be reflected by the calm lake, although because the positions of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Prisma.gif\">rainbows</a> \ndepend on the location of the observer, a slightly displaced image of each \nrainbow is actually being imaged.",
