  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAre <a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/I_ASTROP/TRIPOD/\nTRIPOD2.HTM\">photographs of star trails</a> really evidence of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/celsph.html\">Earth's rotation</a>\nabout its axis?\n\nYes they are, and\nscience journalist Trudy E. Bell discovered that there is a\nsimple way to demonstrate this, if you have the stomach for it.\n\n\nFirst, find a playground equipped with a standard\n<a href=\"http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/\nPHTEAH-ft/vol_45/iss_2/85_1.html\">Merry-Go-Round</a> (MGR)\nlocated under or near a large, leafy tree.\n\nSeat yourself near the middle of the MGR platform.\n\nAsk a local playground expert (KID) to get you\nspinning very, very fast.\n\nAs the scenery flashes by at a dizzying rate, point your camera\nskyward and take a picture with a slow shutter speed setting.\n\nThe result will be similar to this excellent image of concentric,\narcing leaf trails centered at a point corresponding to the MGR's\naxis of rotation - a convincing imitation of\n<a href=\"ap061202.html\">circumpolar star trails</a> recorded in\n<a href=\"ap060915.html\">hours-long exposures</a>\nof planet Earth's night sky.\n\nThen, just stand up and walk away ...\n<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=bWKUjKQxg0A\">if you still can</a>.",
