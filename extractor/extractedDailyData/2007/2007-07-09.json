  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhen is the Sun most distant from Earth?  \n\nIt <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion\">happened again</a>\njust this past weekend.  \n\nA common misconception is that the Sun is most distant during\nthe winter, when it's the coldest.  \n\nIn truth, however, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season\">seasonal temperatures</a>\nare more\n<a href=\"http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/seasons_orbit.html\">greatly\ninfluenced</a> \nby the number of daylight hours and how high the Sun rises.  \n\nFor example, during northern winter, the tilt of the Earth causes the \n<a href=\"ap051221.html\">Sun to be</a> above the horizon for a\nshorter time and remain lower in the sky than in northern summer.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.thesuperspace.com/\nImagenes%20web/Perihelio%20Afelio%202006.jpg\">The picture</a>\ncompares the\nrelative size of the Sun during Earth's closest approach in\nJanuary (northern winter) on the left,\nand in July (northern summer) on the right.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://astsun.astro.virginia.edu/~jh8h/glossary/\nangularsize.htm\">angular size</a> of the Sun is\nnoticeably smaller during July, when it is farther away.\n\nIf the <a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/\nlink=/the_universe/uts/earth3.html\">Earth's orbit</a>\nwas <a href=\"ap970101.html\">perfectly circular</a>, \nthe Sun would always appear to be the same size. \n\nThese <a href=\"http://www.thesuperspace.com/\nImagenes%20web/Perihelio%20Afelio%202006.jpg\">two solar images</a>\nwere taken from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a> during 2006, \nbut the same effect can be seen in any year from any \n<a href=\"ap060620.html\">Earth-bound location</a>.",
