  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSkygazers recently following\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/\ngallery_holmes_page24.htm\">Comet Holmes</a>\nhave probably also chanced across this\n<a href=\"http://www.spiegelteam.de/NGC884.htm\">lovely starfield</a>,\nnot far from the comet on the sky in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_constellation\">Perseus</a>.\n\nSome 7,000 light-years away, this pair of open or galactic\n<a href=\"ap050804.html\">star clusters</a> is an easy\nbinocular target and is visible to the unaided eye from\ndark sky areas.\n\nIn fact, it was cataloged in 130 BC\nby Greek astronomer <a href=\"http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/\nhipparchus.html\">Hipparchus</a>.\n\nNow known as\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n0869.html\">h and\nchi Persei</a>, or\n<a href=\"http://www.messier45.com/cgi-bin/dsdb/\ndsb.pl?str=NGC869\">NGC 869</a>(left) and NGC 884, the clusters\nthemselves are separated by only a few hundred light-years and\ncontain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun. \n\nIn addition to being physically close together, the clusters' ages\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104179v2\">based on</a>\ntheir individual stars are similar - evidence that\nboth clusters were likely a product of the same star-forming\nregion.",
