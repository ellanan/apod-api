  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft took some stunning images of \nJupiter earlier this year while on the way out to Pluto.\n\nFamous for its\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/aug5/jupgrstable.html\">Great\nRed Spot</a>, \nJupiter is also known for its regular, equatorial cloud bands,\n<a href=\"http://www.observers.org/reports/97.08.18.html\">visible through</a>\neven modest sized telescopes.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/pages/100907_7.html\">above image</a> was taken near Jupiter's \n<a href=\"ap030424.html\">terminator</a>, and shows that the \nJovian giant possibly has the widest diversity of \n<a href=\"ap050911.html\">cloud patterns</a> in our Solar System.  \n\nOn the far left are clouds closest to Jupiter's south pole.  \n\nHere turbulent \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lA5az6ucG8\">whirlpools</a> \nand swirls are seen in a dark region,\ndubbed a belt, that rings the planet.  \n\nEven light colored regions, called zones, show tremendous structure, \ncomplete with \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00001187/\">complex wave patterns</a>.   \n\nThe energy that drives these waves likely comes from below.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a>\nis the \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/\nfastest_spacecraft.html\">fastest space probe</a>\never launched, and is zipping through the \n<a href=\"http://www.kidsastronomy.com/solar_system.htm\">Solar System</a> \non track to reach Pluto in 2015.",
