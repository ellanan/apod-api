  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat does the Sun look like in all three spatial dimensions?  \n\nTo find out, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> launched two \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO\">STEREO satellites</a> \nto perceive three dimensions on the Sun much like two eyes allow \n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/\">humans</a> to \n<a href=\"http://www2.iicm.tugraz.at/0x811bc833_0x000dacca\">perceive three dimensions</a> \non the Earth.\n\n\nSuch a perspective is designed to allow new insight into the surface of the \n<a href=\"ap000403.html\">rapidly changing Sun</a>, \nallowing humans to better understand and predict things like \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml\">Coronal Mass Ejections</a> \nand <a href=\"ap060502.html\">solar flares</a> \nthat affect the Earth as well as satellites and astronauts orbiting the Earth.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/news/stereo3D_press.html\">Pictured above</a> are two simultaneous images of the Sun taken by STEREO A and \n<a href=\"ap070303.html\">STEREO B</a>, now digitally combined to give one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/stereo3DPressReleaseApril23.html\">first 3-D pictures of the Sun</a> ever taken.   \n\nTo fully appreciate the image, one should view it with \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/sun/3D_Glasses.html\">3-D red-blue glasses</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap061204.html\">teeming</a> and \n<a href=\"ap000110.html\">bubbling</a> solar surface can be seen sporting a \n<a href=\"ap040330.html\">prominent solar prominence</a> \nnear the top of the image.",
