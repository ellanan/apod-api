And fortunately (sometimes) the sky\ngenerously rewards its observer\".\n\nNow very close to the Sun,\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006p1.html\">Comet McNaught</a>\n(along with Mercury) is visible in\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/\nrealtime/c3/512/\">realtime images from the SOHO spacecraft</a>.\n\nOtherwise, skywatchers will find the comet hard to see this weekend.\n\nBut southern hemisphere observers could be rewarded\nnext week as Comet McNaught begins to climb\n<a href=\"http://skytonight.com/observing/highlights/5133461.html\">higher\nin southern skies</a>.",
