  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat was the very early universe like?  \n\nTo help find out, astronomers pointed the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nbetween bright nearby objects to create one of the deepest images ever -- the \n<a href=\"ap040309.html\">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> (HUDF).  \n\nThe resulting HUDF is like a \n<a href=\"ap060501.html\">jewel box</a> of strange and distant galaxies.  \n\nA recent analysis of the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2004/07/\">HUDF</a> \nfocused on the smallest, faintest and most compact galaxies imaged.   \n\nThese small galaxies are thought to be the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution\">building blocks</a> of \n<a href=\"ap061126.html\">modern galaxies</a>.\n\nAnalysis shows that these small galaxies are indeed themselves frequently merging to form large galaxies.   \n\nAn image of this field with the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> \nshows a lack of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared\">infrared</a> \nemission that would be expected from old stars, \nindicating that these small galaxies are very young, possibly only a few million years old.  \n\nTherefore the young blue stars might be members of the \n<a href=\"ap070102.html\">first-ever generation of stars</a>.\n\nPart of the HUDF is \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/31/full/\">shown above</a>, \nwhile one blue building-block galaxy, highly \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/cosmological_redshift.html\">redshifted</a> by the universe so as to appear more yellow, \nis shown in the upper left inset.",
