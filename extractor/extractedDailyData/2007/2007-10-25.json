  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTonight, those blessed with clear skies can enjoy\na <a href=\"ap070926.html\">glorious Full Moon</a>,\n(exact full phase at 0452 UT, October 26).\n\nIn fact, the Moon will\nreach its full phase within a few hours of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion\">perigee</a>,\nthe closest point in its\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/physical_science/\nphysics/mechanics/orbit/ellipse.html&amp;edu=high\">elliptical orbit</a>,\nmaking it the largest Full Moon of 2007.\n\nOn April 3, the Full Moon was within hours of apogee,\nthe farthest point in the <a href=\"ap991108.html\">lunar orbit</a>,\ncorresponding to the smallest Full Moon of 2007.\n\nThe difference in apparent size between the largest and smallest Full\nMoon is quite dramatic and similar to\n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Lunar-Scenes-Apo-Perigee-2006.htm\">this\nside by side</a> comparison of the lunar\n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html\">apogee/perigee</a>\napparitions from 2006.\n\nBut seen in the sky many months apart, the change is difficult to notice.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.aaa.org/aaawhatsup.htm\">Skygazers should</a>\nalso enjoy <a href=\"http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/\nmoon.html\">the Moon</a> on Saturday, October 27, as\nit encounters the lovely\n<a href=\"ap070428.html\">Pleiades</a> star cluster.\n\nBecause the Moon will be so bright, it will be easiest to spot the\nPleiades stars near the Moon with binoculars or a small telescope.",
