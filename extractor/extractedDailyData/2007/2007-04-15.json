  "title": "M3: Inconstant Star Cluster",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nStar clusters appear constant because photographs of \nthem are frozen in time.  \n\nIn reality, though, \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/glob.html\">cluster stars</a> \nswarm the center and frequently fluctuate in brightness.  \n\nAlthough the time it takes for stars to \n<a href=\"http://www.maths.tcd.ie/EMIS/journals/LRG/Articles/Volume5/2002-2benacquista/node4.html\">cross a cluster</a> is about 100,000 years, \nthe time it takes for a star to fluctuate noticeably \ncan be less than one night.  \n\nIn fact, the <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~jhartman/M3_movies.html\">above time lapse movie</a> of bright \n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular</a> cluster \n\n<a href=\"ap030915.html\">M3</a> was taken over a single night.  \n\nMost of the variable stars \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~jhartman/M3_movies.html\">visible above</a> are \n<a href=\"http://etacar.umn.edu/~martin/rrlyrae/rrlyrex.htm\">RR Lyrae stars</a>, stars that can quickly double their \nbrightness while becoming noticeably bluer.  \n\nFurthermore, <a href=\"http://www.dibonsmith.com/lyr_rr.htm\">RR Lyrae</a> stars vary their light in a distinctive pattern \nthat allows unique identification.  \n\nLastly, since <a href=\"\nhttp://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/RR_Lyrae_star.html\">RR Lyrae stars</a> all have the same intrinsic brightness, \nidentifying them and measuring how dim they appear \ntells how far they are, since \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder\">faintness means farness</a>.  \n\nThese distances, in turn, help calibrate the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate96.html\">scale of the entire universe</a>.",
