  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nPlanet <a href=\"ap991115.html\">HD 209458b</a> is evaporating.  \n\nIt is so close to its parent star that its heated atmosphere is simply expanding away into space.  \n\nSome astronomers studying this distant planetary system now believe they have detected water vapor among the gases being liberated.   \n\n<a href=\"http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/0704.1114\">This controversial claim</a>, \nif true, would mark the first instance of planetary water beyond our Solar System, and indicate anew that life might be sustainable elsewhere in the universe.  \n\n<a href=\"ap011128.html\">HD 209458</a>b is known as a \n<a href=\"http://www.physorg.com/news11909.html\">hot Jupiter</a> \ntype system because it involves a Jupiter-type planet in a Mercury-type orbit.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy\">spectroscopic</a> \nobservations from the <a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nare the basis for the water detection claim, \nthe planetary system is too small and faint to image.  \n\nTherefore, an artist's impression of the HD 209458b system is \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0303b.html\">shown above</a>.  \n\nResearch into the atmospheric composition of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_209458_b\">HD 209458b</a> and other \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet\">extrasolar planets</a> \nis continuing.",
