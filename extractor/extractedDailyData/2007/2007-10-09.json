  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes, after your eyes adapt to the dark, a spectacular sky appears.\n\nIn this case, a picturesque lake lies in front of you, beautiful green \n<a href=\"ap051120.html\">aurora flap</a> high above you, brilliant stars shine far in the distance, and, for a brief moment, a \n<a href=\"ap011118.html\">bright meteor</a> streaks by.  \n\nThis digitally fused breathtaking panorama was captured late last month across one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.co.fairbanks.ak.us/ParksandRecreation/ChenaLakes/\">Chena Lakes</a> \nin \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole%2C_Alaska\">North Pole</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska\">Alaska</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>, and includes the \n<a href=\"ap060109.html\">Pleiades</a> \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a> of stars on the image right.  \n\nThe shot is unusual not only for the \n<a href=\"ap070508.html\">many wonders</a> it has captured simultaneously, \nbut because lakes this far north tend to freeze and become \nnon-<a href=\"ap070912.html\">reflecting</a> before a \n<a href=\"ap070816.html\">sky this dark</a> can be photographed.",
