  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAcross the heart of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster lies\na string of galaxies known as\n<a href=\"ap061011.html\">Markarian's Chain</a>.\n\nProminent in Markarian's Chain are these two interacting\ngalaxies, NGC 4438 (left) and NGC 4435 - also known as The Eyes.\n\nAbout 50 million light-years away, the two\n<a href=\"http://www.messier45.com/cgi-bin/dsdb/\ndsb.pl?str=NGC+4438\">galaxies appear</a>\nto be about 100,000 light-years apart in\n<a href=\"http://www.rdelsol.com/Galaxy/NGC4435_NGC4438.html\">this\nsharp close-up</a>, but have likely approached\nto within an estimated 16,000 light-years of each other\nin their <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\ncosmic_lookback.html\">cosmic past</a>.\n\nGravitational tides from\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/ngc4438/\">the\nclose encounter</a> have ripped away at\ntheir stars, gas, and dust.\n\nThe more massive NGC 4438 managed to hold on\nto much of the material torn out in the\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/main.html\">collision</a>,\nwhile material from the smaller NGC 4435 was more\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/wp/2007/05/13/\nngc-4438-and-ngc-4435/\">easily lost</a>.\n\nThe remarkably deep image of this crowded region\n<a href=\"http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/\">of the universe</a> also\nincludes many more distant background galaxies.",
