  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did this unusually large nebula form?  \n\nOne of the largest nebulas yet detected is actually a complex ring of \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebulas</a> \nconnected by glowing filaments.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/~heydari/projects/N11/big.html\">unusual network</a>, known as N11, spans over 1000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> and is a \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaSC/Pr_7_2004_h_en.html\">prominent structure</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap040902.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>, \nthe largest satellite galaxy of our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nIn the center of the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0866.html\">above image</a> is open star cluster LH9, also known as NGC 1760, \ncomposed of about 50 bright blue stars that emit radiation \nthat has eroded a hole in their surroundings.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996A%26A...308..588R\">leading hypothesis</a> \nfor the formation of N11 is shells of successive generations of \nstars being formed further out from the center.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap040707.html\">bright region just above center</a> is \n<a href=\"http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/~heydari/projects/N11/big.html\">N11B</a>, \nan explosive domain where stars are being formed even today.",
