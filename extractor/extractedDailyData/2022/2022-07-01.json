  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nStars trail through a clear morning sky in\nthis postcard from\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/\">a rotating planet</a>.\n\nThe timelapse image is constructed from consecutive exposures made\nover nearly three hours with a camera fixed to a tripod beside\nthe Forbidden City in Beijing, China on June 24.\n\nArcing above the eastern horizon after the series of\nexposures began,\na waning crescent Moon left the brightest streak and watery reflection.\n\nOn that date the\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/rare-planetary-lineup-morning-june-2022/\">planets of the Solar System</a>\nwere also\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4827325410704973\">lined up along the ecliptic</a>\nand left their own trails before sunrise.  \nSaturn was first to rise on that morning and the ringed planet's trail\nstarts close to the top right edge, almost out of the frame.\n\nInnermost planet Mercury rose only just before the Sun though.\n\nIt left the shortest trail, visible against the twilight\nnear the horizon at the far left.\n\nUranus and Neptune are faint and hard to find,\nbut mingled with the star trails the\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">Solar System's</a>\nplanet trails are all labeled in the scene.",
