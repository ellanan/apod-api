  "title": "A Long Snaking Filament on the Sun",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nEarlier this month, the Sun exhibited one of the longer filaments on record. \n\nVisible as the bright curving streak around the image center, \nthe snaking filament's full extent was estimated to be over\nhalf of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a>'s radius -- more than 350,000 kilometers long.\n\nA filament is composed of  \n<a href=\"ap120820.html\">hot gas held aloft</a> \nby the Sun's magnetic field, so that viewed from the side it would appear as a \n<a href=\"ap140304.html\">raised prominence</a>.  \n\nA different, smaller prominence is simultaneously visible at the Sun's edge.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://avertedimagination.com/img_pages/great_wall_2022.html\">featured image</a> is in false-color and \ncolor-inverted to highlight not only the \n<a href=\"ap150210.html\">filament</a> but the Sun's \n<a href=\"ap971106.html\">carpet</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosphere\">chromosphere</a>. \n\nThe bright dot on the upper right is actually a \n<a href=\"ap150629.html\">dark sunspot</a> about the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/by-the-numbers/\">size of the Earth</a>. \n\nSolar\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence\">filaments</a> \ntypically last from hours to days, eventually collapsing to return hot \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)\">plasma</a> back to the Sun.\n\nSometimes, though, they \n<a href=\"ap190526.html\">explode</a> and \n<a href=\"ap180902.html\">expel particles</a> into the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">Solar System</a>, some of which trigger \n<a href=\"ap220322.html\">auroras</a> on Earth.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=188146\">pictured filament</a> appeared in early September and continued to \n<a href=\"https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/cute-kitten-hanging-on-to-rope-isolated-on-white-picture-id152959821\">hold steady</a> for about a week.",
