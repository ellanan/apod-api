  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is one of the largest nebulas on the sky -- why isn't it better known?\n\nRoughly the same angular size as the \n<a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-m31fsqblock/\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, the Great Lacerta Nebula can be found toward the \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/static/public/constellations/gif/LAC.gif\">constellation of the Lizard (Lacerta)</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4sybbzoATrJzKm7rwciljM\">emission nebula</a> is difficult to see with wide-field binoculars because \n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/66XQphfVLgljelmB4gYOp3\">it is so faint</a>, but also usually \n<a href=\"https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/cat-looking-surprised-peering-over-the-edge-of-the-picture-john-daniels.jpg\">difficult to see</a> with a \nlarge telescope because it is so great in angle -- spanning about three \n<a href=\"https://www.geogebra.org/m/atq6mr3a\">degrees</a>.\n\nThe depth, breadth, waves, and beauty of the nebula -- cataloged as \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/6egtl5/\">Sharpless 126 (Sh2-126)</a> -- \ncan best be seen and appreciated with a \n<a href=\"ap200329.html\">long duration camera exposure</a>.\n\nThe featured image is one such combined exposure -- in this case \n10 hours over five different colors and over six nights during \nthis past June and July at the \n<a href=\"https://icastronomy.com/\">IC Astronomy Observatory</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap161024.html\">hydrogen</a> gas in the Great Lacerta Nebula \n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5mPR3yiM9UKLRjaGe6jobu\">glows red</a> because it is excited by light from the bright star \n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6KLAtMAMknWsqpvmMHna0C\">10 Lacertae</a>, one of the bright blue stars just above the red-glowing nebula's center. \n\nThe stars and nebula are about 1,200 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> distant.",
