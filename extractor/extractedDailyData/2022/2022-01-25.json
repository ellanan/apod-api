  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhich direction is this comet heading? \n\nJudging by the tail, one might imagine that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2021_A1_(Leonard)\">Comet Leonard</a> is traveling towards the bottom right, \nbut a full 3D analysis shows it traveling \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2021_A1_(Leonard)#/media/File:Animation_of_C%EF%BC%8F2021_A1's_orbit_around_Sun_-_2021_close_approach.gif\">almost directly away</a> from the camera. \n\nWith this perspective, the \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/cometary+dust+tail\">dust tail</a> is trailed towards the camera and can only be seen \nas a short yellow-white glow near the head of the comet. \n\nThe bluish <a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a>, however, is made up of escaping ions that are \nforced directly away from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a> by the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2288/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/\">solar wind</a> -- \nbut channeled along the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun\">Sun's magnetic field</a> lines. \n\nThe Sun's magnetic field is quite complex, however, and occasionally \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8NDPsSZCcz0?t=23\">solar magnetic reconnection</a> will \n<a href=\"ap220110.html\">break the ion tail</a> into knots that are pushed away from the Sun.\n\nOne such knot is visible in the featured one-hour \ntime-lapse video captured in late December from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand\">Thailand</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/where-is-cometleonard\">Comet Leonard</a> is now fading as it heads out of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">our Solar System</a>.",
