  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is one of the more unusual rocks yet found on Mars.\n\nSmaller than a penny, the rock has several appendages that make it look, to some, like a flower.\n\nAlthough it would be a major discovery if the rock was truly a fossilized ancient \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia25077-curiosity-finds-a-martian-flower\">Martian flower</a>, there are \n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/mrfrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MRFRS_SadCat.jpg\">less spectacular</a> -- and \n<a href=\"https://www.pethealthnetwork.com/sites/default/files/why-should-i-spay-my-new-kitten-138101629.jpg\">currently preferred</a> -- \nexplanations for its unusual structure. \n\nOne theory that has emerged is that the rock is a type of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concretion\">concretion</a> \ncreated by minerals deposited by water in cracks or divisions in existing rock.\n\nThese concretions can be compacted together, can be harder and denser than surrounding rock, and can remain even after the surrounding rock \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion\">erodes</a> away. \n\nThe flower structure may also be caused by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_cluster\">crystal clusters</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/154699/curiosity-finds-a-bizarre-rock-on-mars-that-looks-like-a-flower/\">small rock</a>, named Blackthorn Salt, has similarities to \n<a href=\"ap140929.html\">previously</a> \n<a href=\"ap060126.html\">imaged</a> \n<a href=\"ap040817.html\">Martian</a> \n<a href=\"ap040405.html\">pebbles</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/26587/curiosity-finds-a-martian-flower/\">featured image</a> was taken by the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity rover</a> on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/\">Mars</a> \nin late February. \n\nScientists will continue to study data and images taken of this \n-- and similar -- surprising \n<a href=\"ap991030.html\">Martian rocks</a>.",
