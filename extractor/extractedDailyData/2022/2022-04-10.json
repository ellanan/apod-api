  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWas this image of the Moon's surface taken with a microscope?\n\nNo -- it's a \n<a href=\"https://www.lroc.asu.edu/posts/271\">multi-temporal illumination map</a> made with a wide-angle camera.\n\t\nTo create it, the \n<a href=\"https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft</a> collected \n1,700 images over a period of 6 lunar days (6 Earth months), \nrepeatedly covering an area centered on the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole\">Moon's south pole</a> from different angles. \n\nThe resulting images were stacked to produce the \n<a href=\"https://www.lroc.asu.edu/posts/271\">featured map</a> -- \nrepresenting the percentage of time each spot on the surface was illuminated by the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a>. \n\nRemaining convincingly \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4043\">in shadow</a>, \nthe floor of the 19-kilometer diameter \n<a href=\"https://www.south-pole.com/p0000097.htm\">Shackleton</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shackleton_(crater)\">crater</a> \nis seen near the map's center. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap200206.html\">lunar south pole</a> \nitself is at about 9 o'clock on the crater's rim. \n\nCrater floors near the lunar south and north poles can remain in permanent \n<a href=\"ap190722.html\">shadow</a>, \nwhile mountain tops can remain in nearly \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlngRTDQMAk/hqdefault.jpg\">continuous sunlight</a>. \n\nUseful for \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/\">future outposts</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/EA46nq6klPw\">shadowed crater</a> floors could offer \n<a href=\"ap101025.html\">reservoirs of water-ice</a>, while the \nsunlit mountain tops offer \n<a href=\"https://www.whatnextnow.com/home/solar/where-is-the-best-location-on-earth-for-solar-energy\">good locations</a> to collect \n<a href=\"https://climatekids.nasa.gov/concentrating-solar/\">solar power</a>.",
