  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe world is waking up to a picturesque planet parade.\n\nJust before dawn, the eastern skies over much of \n<a href=\"ap220206.html\">planet Earth</a> \nare decorated by a notable line of familiar planets.\n\nIn much of Earth's northern hemisphere, this \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/\">line of planets</a> appears most \n<a href=\"ap220420.html\">nearly horizontal</a>, \nbut in much of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere\">Earth's southern hemisphere</a>, the line appears more nearly vertical.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcpEDd4JTj-/\">Pictured</a> over the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mGFz4T5W2qY\">Sydney Opera House</a> in southern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, \nthe planet line was captured nearly vertical about five days ago. \n\nFrom top to bottom, the morning planets are \n<a href=\"ap220123.html\">Saturn</a>, \n<a href=\"ap210701.html\">Mars</a>, \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-venus/en/\">Venus</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap190205.html\">Jupiter</a>. \n\nAs April ends, the angular distance between <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/venus-and-jupiter-conjunction-april-30-may-1-2022/\">Venus and Jupiter will gradually pass</a> below a degree as they switch places. \n\nThen, as May ends, \n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20220529_20_100\">Jupiter will pass near Mars</a> as those two planets \n<a href=\"https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/1007292391/thumb/1.jpg\">switch places</a>. \n\nIn June, the parade will briefly expand to include Mercury.",
