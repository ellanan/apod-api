  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could see the entire sky -- all at once -- for an entire year?\n\nThat, very nearly, is what is pictured here. \n\nEvery 15 minutes during 2021, an \n<a href=\"ap011119.html\">all-sky camera</a> took an image of the sky over the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands\">Netherlands</a>.\n\nCentral \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Keogram_explainer.gif\">columns</a> from these images were then aligned and combined to create the featured\n<a href=\"https://victoriaweather.ca/keogram.php#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20keogram\">keogram</a>, with January at the top, \nDecember at the bottom, \nand the middle of the night running vertically just left of center.\n\n<a href=\"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000064777927-e3ahj5-t500x500.jpg\">What do we see?</a> \n\nMost obviously, the daytime \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">sky is mostly blue</a>, while the nighttime sky is mostly black. \n\nThe twelve \n<a href=\"ap220301.html\">light bands</a> crossing the night sky are caused by the \n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/how-bright-moon-exactly/\">glow of the Moon</a>.\n\nThe thinnest part of the black hourglass shape occurs during the summer \n<a href=\"https://scijinks.gov/solstice/\">solstice</a> when days are the longest, \nwhile the thickest part occurs at the winter \n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/tag/solstice/\">solstice</a>.\n\nYesterday was an \n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/tag/equinox/\">equinox</a> -- when night and day were equal -- and the northern-spring \n<a href=\"ap220320.html\">equinox</a> from one year ago \ncan actually be located in the keogram -- about three-quarters of the way up.",
