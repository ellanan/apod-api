  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYou couldn't see Comet Leonard’s \n<a href=\"ap211230.html\">extremely long tail</a> with a telescope — it was just \ntoo long.\n\nYou also couldn't see it with binoculars — still too long.\n\nOr with your eyes -- it was too dim.\n\nOr from a city — the <a href=\"ap200408.html\">sky was too bright</a>.\n\nBut from a dark location with a low horizon — \n<a href=\"https://delavanlakesvet.com/images/uploads/general_images/smiling-cat-for-web.jpg\">your camera could</a>.\n\nAnd still might -- if \n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-leonard-a-gift-at-christmastime/\">the comet</a> survives today's closest encounter with the Sun, \nwhich occurs between the orbits of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury/overview/\">Mercury</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus\">Venus</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanHattenbach/status/1476896626312679430/photo/1\">featured picture</a> was created from two deep and \nwide-angle camera images taken from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/O0_YXaP-7yw\">La Palma</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a> \nof <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a> late last month. \n\nAfterwards, if it survives, what is left of \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/cometleonard-info\">Comet Leonard</a>'s \nnucleus will head out of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">our Solar System</a>, never to return.",
