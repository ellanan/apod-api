  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMany details of Saturn appear clearly in infrared light. \n\nBands of clouds show great structure, including long \n<a href=\"ap190915.html\">stretching storms</a>. \n\nAlso quite striking in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> is the unusual \n<a href=\"ap130220.html\">hexagonal cloud pattern</a> surrounding \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>'s North Pole. \n\nEach side of the dark \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/hexagon.html\">hexagon</a> spans roughly the width of our Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon\">The hexagon</a>'s existence was not predicted, \nand its origin and likely stability remains a \n<a href=\"http://laplazagigi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dog-with-glasses.jpg\">topic of research</a>.  \n\nSaturn's famous \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/saturn-rings/en/\">rings</a> \ncircle the planet and \n<a href=\"ap120703.html\">cast shadows</a> below the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/side_image/public/thumbnails/image/equator_.png?itok=fpt9ejEa\">equator</a>.\n\nThe featured image was taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> in 2014 in several infrared colors. \n\nIn 2017 September, the \n<a href=\"ap110613.html\">Cassini mission</a> was brought to a \ndramatic conclusion when the spacecraft was  \n<a href=\"ap170125.html\">directed to dive</a> into ringed giant.",
