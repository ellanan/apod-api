  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMars looks sharp in these two rooftop telescope views captured in\nlate November from Singapore, planet Earth.\n\nAt the time,\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/why-is-mars-sometimes-bright-and-sometimes-faint/\">Mars was about 82 million kilometers</a>\nfrom Singapore and approaching its\nopposition, opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky on December 8.\n\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/olympus-mons.html\">Olympus Mons</a>,\nlargest of the volcanoes in the Tharsis Montes region\n(and largest known volcano in the Solar System), is near Mars'\nwestern limb.\n\nIn both images it's the whitish donut-shape at the upper right.\n\nThe dark area visible near center is the\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/new-gully-channel-terra-sirenum-pia17958/\">Terra Sirenum</a>\nregion while the long dark peninsula closest to the\nplanet's eastern limb is Sinus Gomer.\n\nNear its tip is Gale crater,\nthe Curiosity rover's\n<a href=\"ap120808.html\">landing site in 2012</a>.\n\nAbove Sinus Gomer, white spots are other volcanoes in the\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6056/elysium/\">Elysium</a>\nregion.\n\nAt the top of the planet is the <a href=\"ap171219.html\">north polar cap</a>\ncovered with ice and clouds.\n\nTaken about two days apart, these images of the same\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">martian hemisphere</a>\nform a stereo pair.\n\nLook at the center of the frame and cross your eyes until\nthe separate images come together to see the Red Planet in 3D.",
