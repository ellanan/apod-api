  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNear the center of a nearby star-forming region lies a massive cluster containing some of the largest and hottest stars known. \n\nCollectively known as star cluster \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2070\">NGC 2070</a>, \nthese stars are part of the vast \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_Nebula\">Tarantula Nebula</a> \nand were captured in two kinds of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared light</a> by the new \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/james-webb-space-telescope/in-depth/\">Webb Space Telescope</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/041/01GA76MYFN0FMKNRHGCAGGYCVQ\">main image</a> shows the group of stars at NGC 2070's center -- known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R136\">R136</a> -- in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/F_The_Infrared_Region.html\">near-infrared</a>, light just a bit too red for \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">humans</a> to see.\n\nIn contrast, the \n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/041/01GA77BCCQDQ8JZ0D5FCN70QHK\">rollover image</a> captures the cluster center in mid-infrared light, \nlight closer to \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio waves</a>. \n\nSince <a href=\"ap210110.html\">R136</a>'s brightest stars emit \nmore of their light in the near infrared, they are much \n<a href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/8623/16525162295_6d833e5c55_b.jpg\">more prominent</a> on that image.\n\nThis <a href=\"ap190905.html\">LMC</a> cluster's massive stars emit particle winds and energetic light that are evaporating the gas cloud from which they formed.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/041/01GA77EN9DSRGNGXWECYX1H1FP\">Webb images</a>, released yesterday, shows details of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xsq1oaehLG4\">R136</a> and \n<a href=\"ap201113.html\">its surroundings</a> \nthat have never been seen before, \ndetails that are helping humanity to a better understanding of how all \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars are born, evolve and die</a>.",
