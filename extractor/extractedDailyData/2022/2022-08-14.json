  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOver 4000 planets are now known to exist outside our Solar System.\n\nKnown as \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/about-exoplanets/\">exoplanets</a>, this milestone was passed last month, as recorded by \n<a href=\"https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/\">NASA's Exoplanet Archive</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAUwsXSENA4\">featured video</a> \nhighlights these exoplanets in sound and light, \nstarting chronologically from the first confirmed detection in 1992 and continuing into 2019. \n\nThe entire night sky is first \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjkWi9pf0dM\">shown compressed</a> with the \n<a href=\"ap180418.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> making a giant U. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/how-to-search-for-exoplanets.html\">Exoplanets detected</a> \nby slight jiggles in their parents-star's colors (<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/radial-velocity.html\">radial velocity</a>) appear in pink, \nwhile those detected by slight dips in their parent star's brightness \n(<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/transit-photometry.html\">transit</a>) are shown in purple.\n\nFurther, those exoplanets \n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/direct-imaging.html\">imaged directly</a> appear in orange, \nwhile those detected by \n<a href=\"ap220705.html\">gravitationally magnifying</a> \nthe light of a background star \n(<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/microlensing.html\">microlensing</a>) are shown in green. \n\nThe faster a planet orbits its parent star, \nthe higher the accompanying \n<a href=\"https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano\">tone played</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7272\">retired</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html\">Kepler</a> satellite has discovered \n<a href=\"https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html\">about half of these first 4000 exoplanets</a> \nin just one region of the sky, while the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess\">TESS mission</a> \nis on track to find even more, all over the sky, orbiting the \n<a href=\"ap190625.html\">brightest</a> nearby stars. \n\nFinding \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet\">exoplanets</a> \nnot only helps humanity to better understand the potential \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/how-do-we-find-life/\">prevalence of life</a> elsewhere in the universe, but also how our \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> were formed.",
