  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nJust now, before you hit the button, two future universes are possible. \n\nAfter pressing the button, though, you will live in only one. \n\nA real-web version of the famous \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat\">Schrödinger's cat experiment</a>\nclicking the red button in the \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7678545042\">featured astronaut image</a> should transform that image into \na picture of the same astronaut holding one of two cats -- one living, or one dead. \n\nThe timing of your click, combined with the \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v9/n4/full/nrn2258.html\">wiring of your brain</a> and the millisecond timing of your device, will all conspire together to create a \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PhRvD..90l3514A/abstract\">result dominated</a>, potentially, by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy\">randomness of quantum mechanics</a>. \n\nSome believe that your personally-initiated \n<a href=\"https://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21138\">quantum decision</a> \nwill split the universe in two, and that both the \nlive-cat and dead-cat universes exist in separate parts of a \n<a href=\"https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2011/05/26/are-many-worlds-and-the-multiverse-the-same-idea/\">larger multiverse</a>.\n\nOthers believe that the result of your click will \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse\">collapse</a> the two possible \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/universe-missions-list\">universes</a> \ninto one -- in a way that could not have been predicted beforehand. \n\nYet others believe that \n<a href=\"ap220316.html\">the universe</a> is classically \n<a href=\"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2021/12/does-superdeterminism-save-quantum.html\">deterministic</a>, so that by pressing the button you did not <i>really</i> split the universe, but just carried out an action predestined since time began.   \n\n<a href=\"ap200616.html\">We</a> at \n<a href=\"ap150616.html\">APOD</a> believe that however \n<a href=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/how-win-social-media-right-now-silly-cat-pics-dont-cut.jpg?crop=1:1\">silly</a> \nyou may feel clicking the red button, and regardless of the outcome,  \nyou should have a thought-provoking day. \n\nOr two.",
