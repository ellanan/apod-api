  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does Comet Leonard look like up close?\n\nAlthough we can't go there, imaging the comet's coma and inner tails through a small telescope gives us a good idea. \n\nAs the name implies, the \n<a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a> is made of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0uPclhKPpM\">ionized gas</a> -- gas energized by \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> \nfrom the Sun and pushed outward by the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zOlkIyg3iE\">solar wind</a>. \n\nThe solar wind is quite structured and sculpted by the Sun's complex and ever \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/dynamo.shtml\">changing magnetic field</a>.\n\nThe effect of the variable solar wind combined with different gas jets venting from the comet's nucleus accounts for the tail's complex structure. \n\nFollowing the wind, structure in Comet Leonard's \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky/videos/409238244216491\">tail can be seen</a> to move outward from the Sun even alter its <a href=\"ap020515.html\">wavy appearance</a> over time. \n\nThe blue color of the ion tail is dominated by recombining \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide\">carbon monoxide</a> molecules, while the green color of the coma surrounding the \nhead of the comet is created mostly by a slight amount of recombining \n<a href=\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/comets-green-colour-comes-from-dicarbon-dissociation-experiments-confirm/4014966.article\">diatomic carbon</a> molecules.\n\nDiatomic carbon is destroyed by sunlight in \n<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/52/e2113315118\">about 50 hours</a> -- which is \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/science/why-comets-are-green.html\">why its green glow</a> does not make it far into the ion tail.\n\nThe featured image was taken on January 2 from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0bzO0ZnhdU\">Siding Spring Observatory</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>. \n\n<a href=\"ap220103.html\">Comet Leonard</a>, presently best viewed \nfrom Earth's Southern Hemisphere, has \n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-seeking-on-cold-crunchy-nights/\">rounded the Sun</a> and is now headed out of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a>.",
