  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBluish reflection nebulae seem to fill this dusty expanse.\n\nThe sharp\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/j5dpn5/\">telescopic frame</a>\nspans over 1 degree on the sky toward\nthe faint but fanciful constellation\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/monoceros.html\">Monoceros</a>,\nthe Unicorn.\n\nSeen within the Monoceros R1 cloud complex some 2,500 light-years away,\nbluish IC 447 is on the left, joined by a long dark filament of dust to \nIC 446 at lower right.\n\nEmbedded in IC 447 are young, massive blue stars much hotter than\nthe Sun, whose light is reflected by the cosmic cloud\n<a href=\"ap210123.html\">of star stuff</a>.\n\nObservations reveal that IC 446 also contains a\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-looks-at-light-and-dark-in-the-universe\">young stellar object</a>,\na massive star still in an early stage of evolution.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13894\">The dark filament</a>\nof dust and molecular gas joining\nthe two star-forming regions is over 15 light-years long.",
