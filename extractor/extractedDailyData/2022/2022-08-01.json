  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning.\n\nMore precisely, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the \n<a href=\"ap061022.html\">dusty stellar nurseries</a> in which they formed.\n\nLocated in the \n<a href=\"ap090524.html\">Carina Nebula</a> and known informally as \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/image/2707/news_release/2010-13\">Mystic Mountain</a>, \nthese pillar's appearance is dominated by the dark dust \neven though it is composed mostly of clear \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/rjn/apod/lib/lament.html\">hydrogen</a> gas.\n\nDust pillars such as these are actually much thinner than air and only appear as \n<a href=\"ap100426.html\">mountains</a> due to relatively small amounts of \nopaque interstellar <a href=\"http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html#dust\">dust</a>.  \n\nAbout 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and highlights \nan interior region of Carina which spans about three \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a>.\n\nWithin a few million years, the stars will likely \n<a href=\"https://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/images/2013/01/Cats-Standing/30-Cats-Standing.jpg\">win out</a> completely and the entire dust mountain \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_iAYY3HuSM\">will evaporate</a>.",
