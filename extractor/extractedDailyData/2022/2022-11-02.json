  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWatch for three things in this unusual eclipse video. \n\nFirst, watch for a big dark circle to approach from the right to \n<a href=\"ap170730.html\">block out</a> more and more of the Sun.\n\nThis dark circle is the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">Moon</a>, and the video was made primarily to capture this \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_October_25,_2022\">partial solar eclipse last week</a>.\n\nNext, watch a \n<a href=\"ap220302.html\">large solar prominence</a> \nhover and shimmer over the \n<a href=\"ap080807.html\">Sun's edge</a>.\n\nA close look will show that part of it is actually \n<a href=\"ap180527.html\">falling back</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a>.\n\nThe prominence is made of hot \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)\">plasma</a> that is temporarily held aloft by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun\">Sun's changing magnetic field</a>.\n\nFinally, watch the Sun's edge \n<a href=\"https://www.chelmsfordma.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=9965\">waver</a>.\n\nWhat is \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/scientists-uncover-origins-of-the-sun-s-swirling-spicules\">wavering</a> is a dynamic carpet of \n<a href=\"ap081102.html\">hot gas tubes</a> rising and falling through the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosphere\">Sun's chromosphere</a> -- \ntubes known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_spicule\">spicule</a>s.\n\nThe entire 4-second \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dh5VL5YGoA\">time-lapse video</a> \ncovers a time of about ten minutes, although the Sun itself is expected to \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-age/en/\">last another 5 billion years</a>.",
