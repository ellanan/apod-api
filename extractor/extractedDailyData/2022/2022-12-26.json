  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe star at the center created everything. \n\nKnown as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Egg\">Dragon's Egg</a>, this star -- a rare, hot, luminous\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html\">O-type</a>\nstar some 40 times as massive as the Sun -- \ncreated not only the complex nebula \n(<a href=\"ap060606.html\">NGC 6164</a>) that immediately surrounds it, \nbut also the encompassing blue halo.\n\nIts name is derived, in part, from the region's proximity \nto the picturesque NGC 6188, known as the fighting \n<a href=\"ap220607.html\">Dragons of Ara</a>.\n\nIn another three to four million years the massive star will likely end its\nlife in a <a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/supernovae1.html\">supernova explosion</a>.\n\nSpanning around 4 light-years,\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/188\">the nebula itself</a>\nhas a bipolar symmetry making it similar in appearance to more common \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary\nnebulae</a> - the gaseous shrouds\n<a href=\"ap120831.html\">surrounding</a> dying sun-like stars.\n\nAlso like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have\nan extensive, <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985PASP...97..780F/abstract\">faint halo</a>, revealed in blue in \n<a href=\"https://www.rc-astro.com/photo/id1255_big.html\">this deep telescopic image</a> of the region.\n\nExpanding into the surrounding\n<a href=\"http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar medium</a>,\nthe material in the blue halo was likely expelled \nfrom an earlier active phase of the O-star.\n\nNGC 6164 lies 4,200 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a> away in the\nsouthern constellation of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_square\">Carpenter's Square</a> \n(<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/nor/index.html\">Norma</a>).",
