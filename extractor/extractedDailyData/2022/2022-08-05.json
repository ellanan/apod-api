  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe beautiful Trifid Nebula is a cosmic\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/m/m020.html\">study in contrasts</a>.\n\nAlso known as M20, it lies about\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/5000lys.html\">5,000 light-years</a>\naway toward the <a href=\"ap130712.html\">nebula rich</a>\nconstellation Sagittarius.\n\nA star forming region in the plane of our galaxy,\nthe Trifid does illustrate three different types of\nastronomical nebulae;\nred <a href=\"ap080424.html\">emission nebulae</a> dominated by\nlight from hydrogen atoms,\nblue <a href=\"ap090521.html\">reflection nebulae</a> produced\nby dust reflecting starlight, and\n<a href=\"ap090522.html\">dark nebulae</a> where\ndense dust clouds appear in silhouette.\n\nBut the red emission region, roughly separated into three\nparts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifid_Nebula\">popular name</a>.\n\nPillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of\nthe emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/image/915/news_release/1999-42\">close-up\nimages</a> of the region.\n\nThe Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across.\n\nToo faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers the\narea of a full moon in planet Earth's sky.\n\nOpen star cluster M21 just peeks into this telescopic field of view \nalong the bottom right edge of the frame.",
