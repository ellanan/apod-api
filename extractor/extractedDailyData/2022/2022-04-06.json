  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs Earendel the farthest star yet discovered?\n\nThis <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-003\">scientific possibility</a> started when the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> observed a huge \n<a href=\"ap100502.html\">cluster of galaxies</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens\">gravitational lens</a> effect&nbsp;of this cluster was seen to \n<a href=\"ap190319.html\">magnify and distort</a> a galaxy far in the background.\n\nThis distorted background galaxy -- so far away it has a \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">redshift</a> of 6.2 -- appears in the \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2022/003/01FWS5FJ468Q4HV8C67PEQPVND\">featured image</a> as a long red string, \nwhile beads on that string are likely to be star clusters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe <a href=\"ap170506.html\">galaxy cluster lens</a> \ncreates a line of maximum magnification line where \nsuperposed background objects may appear magnified many thousands of times.\n\nOn the intersection between the galaxy line and the maximum magnification line is one \"bead\" which shows evidence of originating from a \n<a href=\"ap180411.html\">single bright star</a> in the early universe -- now named Earendel.\n\nFuture <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04449-y\">investigation</a>s may include more imaging&nbsp;by Hubble to see how \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/science/hubble-star-big-bang.html\">Earendel's brightness</a> varies, and, quite possibly, by the new \n<a href=\"https://jwst.nasa.gov/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> when it \n<a href=\"https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/faqs/faqLite.html\">becomes operational</a> later this year.&nbsp;\n\nEarendel's  \n<a href=\"https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/surprised-cat-picture-id154887818\">great distance</a> exceeds that of any known stable star -- \nalthough the star that exploded creating \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_090423\">GRB 090423</a> had a \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">redshift</a> of 8.2.",
