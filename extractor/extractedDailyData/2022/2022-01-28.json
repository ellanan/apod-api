  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/189\">The Mare Orientale</a>,\nLatin for Eastern Sea, is one of the most striking\nlarge scale lunar features.\n\nThe youngest of the large lunar impact basins it's \nvery difficult to see from an\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/set-your-sights-on-this-lunar-bulls-eye/\">earthbound perspective</a>.\n\nStill, taken during a period of favorable tilt, or libration of the lunar\nnearside, the Eastern Sea can be found near top center in this sharp\ntelescopic view, extremely foreshortened\n<a href=\"image/2201/WesternMoonTomGlennLabels.jpg\">along the Moon's western edge</a>.\n\nFormed by the impact of an asteroid over 3 billion years\nago and nearly 1000 kilometers across, the\n<a href=\"https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/orbiter/lunar_orbiter/impact_basin/\">impact basin's</a>\nconcentric circular features are ripples in the lunar crust.\n\nBut they are a little easier to spot in\nmore direct images of the region taken from\n<a href=\"ap960112.html\">lunar orbit</a>.\n\nSo why is the Eastern Sea at the Moon's western edge?\n\nThe Mare Orientale lunar feature was named before 1961.\n\nThat's when the convention labeling\n<a href=\"https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2007JBAA..117..129B\">east and west on lunar maps</a>\nwas reversed.",
