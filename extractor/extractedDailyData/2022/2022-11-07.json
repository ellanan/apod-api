  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see?\n\nThe answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/25808333\">video</a> \ntaken during the total lunar\n<a href=\"ap110625.html\">eclipse in 2011</a> \nfrom\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan\">Tajikistan</a>.\n\nDuring a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_lunar_eclipse\">total lunar eclipse</a>, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, \ncausing the moon to fade dramatically.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap180120.html\">Moon never gets completely dark</a>, \nthough, since the Earth's atmosphere\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/refr.html\">refracts</a> some light.\n\nAs the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQeejHExrGI\">featured video</a> begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is a nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon.\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/moon\">Moon</a> \nbecomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become \nvisible and here can be seen reflected in a lake.\n\nMost spectacularly, the\n<a href=\"ap110617.html\">sky surrounding</a> the eclipsed moon\nsuddenly appears to be\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1DNbkKBW0K8\">full of stars</a> \nand highlighted by the busy plane of our\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nThe sequence repeats with a closer view, \nand the final image shows the placement of the eclipsed Moon near the\n<a href=\"ap221004.html\">Eagle</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960829.html\">Swan</a>,\n<a href=\"ap210812.html\">Trifid</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap181112.html\">Lagoon</a> nebulas.\n\nNearly two hours after the eclipse started, the moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full \n<a href=\"https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-cat-glare-745763242.jpg\">glare</a> again dominated the sky.\n\nLater today or tomorrow, depending on your location relative to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line\">International Date Line</a>, a new  \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2022-november-8\">total lunar eclipse</a> will take place -- \nwith totality being primarily visible over northeastern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia\">Asia</a> and northwestern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a>.",
