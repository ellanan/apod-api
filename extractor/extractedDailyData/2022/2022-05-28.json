  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nIn 185 AD,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astronomy\">Chinese astronomers</a>\nrecorded the appearance of a new star in the Nanmen asterism.\n\nThat part of the sky is\nidentified with Alpha and Beta Centauri on modern star charts.\n\nThe new star was visible for months and is thought to be the earliest\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301603\">recorded supernova</a>.\n\nThis deep image shows emission nebula RCW 86,\nunderstood to be the remnant of that stellar explosion.\n\nThe narrowband data trace gas ionized by the still\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1207\">expanding</a> shock wave.\n\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/rcw86/\">Space-based images</a>\nindicate an abundance of the element iron\nand lack of a neutron star or pulsar\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1207\">in the remnant</a>,\nsuggesting that the original supernova was Type Ia.\n\n<a href=\"ap060728.html\">Unlike the core collapse</a>\nsupernova explosion of a massive star, a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia supernova</a>\nis a thermonuclear\n<a href=\"ap110430.html\">detonation on a a white dwarf</a>\nstar that accretes material from a companion in a binary star system.\n\nNear the plane of our\n<a href=\"ap110520.html\">Milky Way</a>\ngalaxy and larger than a full moon on the sky this supernova remnant\nis too faint to be seen by eye though.\n\nRCW 86 is some 8,000 light-years distant and around 100 light-years across.",
