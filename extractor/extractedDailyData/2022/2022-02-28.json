  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYou don't have to look through a telescope to know where it's pointing.\n\nAllowing the <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/telescopes/en/\">telescope</a> to project its image onto a \nlarge surface can be useful because it dilutes the \nintense brightness of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_natural_objects_in_the_sky\">very bright sources</a>.\n\nSuch dilution is useful for looking at \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-sun/en/\">the Sun</a>, \nfor example during a \n<a href=\"ap080802.html\">solar eclipse</a>.\n\nIn the featured single-exposure image, though, it is a \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/episode-19-we-asked-a-nasa-scientist-why-can-you-see-the-moon-during-the-day\">too-bright</a> \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">full moon</a> that is projected.\n\nThis February full moon occurred two weeks ago and is \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/full-moon-names.html\">called the Snow Moon</a> by some northern cultures.  \n\nThe projecting instrument is the main 62-centimeter telescope at the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/snB8f_4KoB0\">Saint-Véran</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory_of_Saint-Veran\">Observatory</a> high in the French \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a>.\n\nSeeing a full moon directly is easier because it is not \n<a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0591/9784/9807/products/cat-with-sunglasses-advanced-animals-cats-paint-by-numbers-global-figuredart-free-shipping_972_640x.jpg\">too bright</a>, although you won't see this level of detail. \n\nYour <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4955\">next chance</a> \nwill occur on March 17.",
