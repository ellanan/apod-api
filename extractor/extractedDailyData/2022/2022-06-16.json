  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThere are four Full Supermoons in 2022.\n\n<a href=\"http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/moon/fullperigee2001.html\">Using\nthe definition</a> of a supermoon as\na Full Moon near perigee, that is\nwithin at least 90% of its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit,\nthe year's Full Supermoon dates are May 16, June 14, July 13, and August 12.\n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/2239/full-moon-guide-june-july-2022/\">Full Moons</a>\nnear perigee really are the brightest\nand largest in planet Earth's sky.\n\nBut size and brightness differences between Full Moons\nare relatively small and an actual\n<a href=\"ap121129.html\">comparison</a>\nwith other Full Moons is difficult to make by eye alone.  \n\nTwo exposures are blended in this supermoon and sky view from June 14.\n\nThat Full Moon was also known to northern\n<a href=\"ap150616.html\">hemisphere skygazers</a>\nas the <a href=\"ap190618.html\">Strawberry moon</a>.\n\nThe consecutive short and long exposures allow familiar features\non the fully sunlit lunar nearside to be seen in the same image as a \n<a href=\"ap190916.html\">faint lunar corona</a>\nand an atmospheric cloudscape.\n\nThey were captured in skies over\n<a href=\"ap141011.html\">Chongqing, China</a>.",
