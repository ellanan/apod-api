  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow many galaxies are interacting here? \n\nThis grouping of galaxies is called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild's_Triplet\">Wild Triplet</a>, not only for the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wild_(Australian_scientist)\">discoverer</a>, but for the number of bright galaxies that appear.\n\nIt had been assumed that all three galaxies, \ncollectively cataloged as \n<a href=\"https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/Arp_contents.html\">Arp</a> 248, are \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">interacting</a>, \nbut more \n<a href=\"https://i.insider.com/55a67a7a371d22ce178b6624\">recent investigations</a> reveal that only the \nbrightest two galaxies are sparring gravitationally: \nthe big galaxies at the top and bottom.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral galaxy</a> in the middle of the \n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/potw2244a/\">featured image</a> by the \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> is actually far in the distance, \nas is the galaxy just below it and all of the other \n<a href=\"ap210802.html\">numerous galaxies</a> in the field. \n\nA striking result of these \n<a href=\"ap211004.html\">giants jousting</a> is a tremendous \n<a href=\"ap190325.html\">bridge</a> of stars, gas, and \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">dust</a> that stretches between them -- a bridge almost 200,000 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a> long.\n\nLight we see today from Wild's Triplet left about \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life#Mesozoic_Era\">200 million years ago</a>, when \n<a href=\"ap171007.html\">dinosaurs</a> roamed the Earth.\n\nIn perhaps a billion years or so, the \n<a href=\"ap220606.html\">two interacting galaxies will merge</a> to form a \n<a href=\"ap120717.html\">single</a> large spiral galaxy.",
