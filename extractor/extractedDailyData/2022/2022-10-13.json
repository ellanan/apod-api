  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those strange rings?\n\nRich in dust, the rings are likely 3D shells -- \nbut <i> how </i> they were created remains a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01812-x\">topic of research</a>. \n\n<i> Where </i> they were created is well known: in a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star\">binary star</a> system that lies about 6,000 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> \naway toward the \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cygnus.html\">constellation of the Swan</a> (Cygnus) -- \na system dominated by the Wolf-Rayet star \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_140\">WR 140</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star\">Wolf-Rayet stars</a> are massive, bright, and known for their \n<a href=\"ap200308.html\">tumultuous winds</a>.\n\nThey are also known for creating and dispersing heavy \n<a href=\"ap200809.html\">elements</a> such as \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml\">carbon</a>  \nwhich is a building block of interstellar \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a>.\n\nThe other star in the \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary</a> is also bright and massive -- but \n<a href=\"https://www.purina.co.uk/sites/default/files/2020-12/How%20Long%20Do%20Cats%20SleepTEASER.jpg\">not as active</a>. \n\nThe two \n<a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/extraordinary-phenomenon-in-space-captured-by-spellbinding-new-image\">great stars</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jousting\">joust</a> in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit#/media/File:Animation_of_Orbital_eccentricity.gif\">oblong orbit</a> as they approach each other about every eight years.\n\nWhen at closest approach, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">X-ray</a> \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022HEAD...1911098C/abstract\">emission from the system</a> increases, as, apparently, \ndoes the dust expelled into space -- creating \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ssJ_I5loCbc?list=PLTiv_XWHnOZpegG_WpYvUvvAegH7e02Aw\">another shell</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceGeck/status/1564137949993656320\">featured</a> <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/star-duo-forms-fingerprint-in-space-nasa-s-webb-finds\">image</a> by the new \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/about/index.html\">Webb Space Telescope</a> resolves \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4lQy8v-BWNw\">greater details</a> and \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WR140.png\">more dust shells</a> than ever before.",
