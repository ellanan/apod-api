  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTo some, it looks like a wheel of a cart.\n\nIn fact, because of its outward appearance, the presence of a central \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-are-galaxies\">galaxy</a>, and its connection with what looks like the spokes of a wheel, \nthe galaxy on the right is known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartwheel_Galaxy\">Cartwheel Galaxy</a>.\n\nTo others, however, it looks like a \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">complicated interaction between galaxies</a> awaiting explanation.\n\nAlong with the two galaxies on the left, \n<a href=\"ap060118.html\">the Cartwheel</a> is part of a \n<a href=\"ap070319.html\">group of galaxies</a> \nabout 500 million light years away in the \n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/scl/index.html\">constellation Sculptor</a>. \n\nThe large galaxy's rim spans over 100,000 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> and is composed of star \nforming regions filled with extremely bright and massive stars. \n\nThe Cartwheel's ring-like shape is the result of \ngravitational disruption caused by a smaller galaxy passing through a large one, \ncompressing the interstellar gas and dust and causing a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">star formation</a> wave to move out like a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9QwiBFN9gI\">ripple</a> across the surface of a pond.\n\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-039\">The featured recent image</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bfAjQX-eapc\">Cartwheel Galaxy</a> by the\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/observatory/index.html\">Webb Space Telescope</a> reveals \n<a href=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/3/13/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-30243-1462295029-5.jpg\">new details</a> not only \nabout where stars are forming, but also about activity near the galaxy's \n<a href=\"ap210804.html\">central black hole</a>.",
