  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula\nis very faint, but also very large in planet Earth's sky.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/4ls0b4/\">In the image</a>,\ncomposed with 30 hours of narrowband image data,\nit spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2477\">Discovered in 2011 by</a>\nFrench astro-imager\n<a href=\"http://outters.fr/wp/?page_id=50\">Nicolas Outters</a>,\nthe Squid Nebula's\n<a href=\"ap200913.html\">bipolar shape</a> is distinguished here\nby the telltale blue-green\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium\">emission from</a>\ndoubly ionized oxygen atoms.\n\nThough apparently\n<a href=\"ap161027.html\">surrounded by</a>\nthe reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129,\nthe true distance and nature of the Squid\nNebula have been difficult to determine.\n\nStill, a more\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...570A.105C/abstract\">recent investigation</a>\nsuggests Ou4 really does lie\n<a href=\"http://www.astroanarchy.blogspot.fi/2013/12/a-start-of-new-project-cepheus-mosaic.html\">within Sh2-129</a>\nsome 2,300 light-years away.\n\nConsistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid\nwould represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/orbits.html\">triple system</a>\nof hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119,\nseen near the center of the nebula.\n\nIf so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over\n50 light-years across.",
