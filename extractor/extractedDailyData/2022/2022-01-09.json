  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat will become of Jupiter's Great Red Spot? \n\nGas giant \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> is the solar system's\nlargest world with about 320 times the mass\n<a href=\"https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\nplanet_table_ratio.html\">of planet Earth</a>.\n\nJupiter is home to one of the largest and longest lasting storm systems known,\nthe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/jupiter-s-great-red-spot-a-swirling-mystery\">Great Red Spot</a> (GRS), visible to the left.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot\">GRS</a> is so large it could swallow Earth, although it has been shrinking. \n\nComparison with historical notes indicate that \n<a href=\"ap140518.html\">the storm</a> \nspans only about one third of the exposed surface area it had 150 years ago.\n\nNASA's \n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/opal/\">Outer Planets Atmospheres Legacy</a> (OPAL) program has been monitoring the storm more recently using the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/fitsimages/karol_masztalerz_01/\">featured Hubble OPAL image</a> shows \n<a href=\"ap180221.html\">Jupiter</a> as it appeared in 2016, \nprocessed in a way that makes red hues appear quite vibrant.\n\nModern <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..151S\">GRS data indicate</a> that the storm continues to constrict its surface area, \nbut is also becoming \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/03/jupiters-great-red-spot-is-shrinking-in-length-but-growing-in-height\">slightly taller</a>, vertically. \n\nNo one knows the future of the \n<a href=\"ap171214.html\">GRS</a>, including the possibility that if the shrinking trend continues, the GRS might one day even do what \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/jupiter/atmosphere?show=hs_jupiter_atmosphere_story_the-stripe-that-disappeared\">smaller spots</a> on Jupiter have done -- \n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/theverybesttop10.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ten-Clearly-Visible-Cats-Who-Suck-at-Hide-and-Seek-8-600x719.jpg\">disappear completely</a>.",
