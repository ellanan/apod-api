  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThese cosmic clouds of gas and dust drift\n<a href=\"ap210211.html\">through rich star fields</a> along the\nplane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the high flying constellation\nCygnus.\n\nThey're too faint to be seen with the unaided eye though, even on a\n<a href=\"https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/planner.cfm\">clear, dark night</a>.\n\nImage data from a\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/ldwpn4/\">camera and telephoto lens</a>\nusing narrowband filters\nwas used to construct this 10 degree wide field of view.\n\nThe deep mosaic reveals a region that includes \nstar forming dust clouds seen in silhouette against the\ncharacteristic glow of atomic hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\nNGC 6888 is the standout emission nebula near the top.\n\nBlown by winds from a massive Wolf-Rayet star it's\nabout 25 light-years across and known as the\n<a href=\"ap210617.html\">Crescent Nebula</a>.\n\nA faint bluish curl just below center in the frame is also the\n<a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-wr134/\">signature of a Wolf-Rayet star</a>.\n\nBurning fuel at a prodigious rate and near the end of their stellar\nlives, both stars will ultimately go out with a bang in a spectacular\nsupernova explosion.\n\nToward the right, a massive, young O type star powers the glow of Sh2-101, the\n<a href=\"ap190921.html\">Tulip Nebula</a>.",
