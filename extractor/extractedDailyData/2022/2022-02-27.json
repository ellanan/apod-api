Wow is that pretty!\"\n\nSoon after \n<a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap08fj/16day4_orbit4.html\">that pronouncement</a>, about 53 years ago, \n<a href=\"https://time.com/5479821/earthrise-picture-history-apollo-8/\">one of the most famous images ever taken</a> \nwas snapped from the orbit of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a>.\n\nNow known as \n\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise\">Earthrise</a>\", \nthe iconic image shows the Earth rising above the limb of the Moon, as \n<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/who-took-legendary-earthrise-photo-apollo-8-180967505/\">taken by the crew</a> of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo8.html\">Apollo 8</a>. \n\nBut the well-known \n<a href=\"ap150906.html\">Earthrise</a> image was actually the \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4593\"><i> second </i> image</a> taken of the \n<a href=\"ap181223.html\">Earth rising</a> above the lunar limb -- \nit was just the first in color. \n\nWith modern digital technology, however, \nthe real first Earthrise image -- originally in black and white -- has \n<a href=\"https://jw9c.blogspot.com/2018/01/earthrise-1.html\">now been remastered</a> to have the combined resolution and color of the \n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/as08-13-2329\">first</a> \n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/as08-14-2383\">three</a> \n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/as08-14-2384\">images</a>. \n\nBehold!
