  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere do stars form? \n\nOne place, star forming regions known as \"EGGs\", are being uncovered at \n<a href=\"ap061022.html\">the end</a> of this \n<a href=\"ap201206.html\">giant pillar</a> of gas and \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">dust</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap201228.html\">Eagle Nebula</a> (M16). \n\nShort for \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporating_gaseous_globule\">evaporating gaseous globules</a>, \nEGGs are dense regions of mostly molecular \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> \ngas that fragment and gravitationally collapse to \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">form stars</a>. \n\nLight from the hottest and brightest of these new stars heats the end of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/pillars-of-creation-revealed-in-3-d\">the pillar</a> and causes further evaporation of gas and dust -- \nrevealing yet more \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1995/44/352-Image.html\">EGGs</a> and more young stars. \n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.pampaskies.com/gallery3/Hubble-Palette-Images/Pillars_HST_data_final_small\">featured picture</a> was created from exposures \nspanning over 30 hours with the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 2014, \nand digitally processed with modern software by experienced volunteers in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina\">Argentina</a>.\n\nNewborn stars will gradually \n<a href=\"https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/funny-dog-made-a-mess-in-the-room-playful-puppy-french-bulldog-picture-id686918844\">destroy</a> their birth pillars over the next 100,000 years or so -- if a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aysiMbgml5g\">supernova</a> doesn't destroy them first.",
