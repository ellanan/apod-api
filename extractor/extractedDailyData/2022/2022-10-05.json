  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens if you crash a spaceship into an asteroid?\n\nIn the case of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://dart.jhuapl.edu/Mission/index.php\">DART</a> \n<a href=\"https://dart.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Impactor-Spacecraft.php\">spaceship</a> and the small asteroid \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimorphos\">Dimorphos</a>, \nas happened last week, you get \n<a href=\"ap210424.html\">quite a plume</a>.\n\nThe goal of the planned impact was \n<a href=\"https://sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/planetary-protection\">planetary protection</a> -- \nto show that the path of an asteroid can be \n<a href=\"ap130221.html\">slightly altered</a>, \nso that, if done right, a big space rock will \n<a href=\"ap111109.html\">miss the Earth</a>.\n\nThe high brightness of the plume, though, was \n<a href=\"https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg\">unexpected</a> by many, and what it means remains a topic of research.\n\nOne possibility is that 170-meter wide \n<a href=\"ap220927.html\">Dimorphos</a> is primarily a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile\">rubble pile asteroid</a> and the collision dispersed \nsome of the rubble in the pile. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2022/09/DART_asteroid_impact_impresses_in_ESA_s_view_from_the_ground\">featured time-lapse video</a> covers about 20 minutes and was taken from the \n<a href=\"https://www.observatoiredesmakes.com/\">Les Makes Observatory</a> on \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap120307.html\">Reunion</a> \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MUEVBSiWWR8\">Island</a>, \noff the southeast coast of southern Africa. \n\nOne of \n<a href=\"https://dart.jhuapl.edu/Mission/index.php\">many Earth-based observatories following the impact</a>, \nthe initial dot is primarily Dimorphos's larger companion: asteroid <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/didymos/in-depth/\">Didymos</a>. \n\t\nMost recently, images show that the Didymos - Dimorphos system has \n<a href=\"https://fb.watch/fYoM-zzFJY/\">developed</a>  \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky/photos/a.5083207711783407/5102042659899912/\">comet-like tails</a>.",
