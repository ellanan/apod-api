  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/vsots_raqr\">Variable star R Aquarii</a>\nis actually an interacting binary star system, \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2017/raqr/\">two stars that</a>\nseem to have a close symbiotic relationship.\n\nCentered in this\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2022/archives/\">space-based optical/x-ray</a>\ncomposite image it lies about 710 light years away.\n\nThe intriguing system consists of a cool \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant\">red giant star</a>\nand hot, dense\n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html\">white dwarf star</a>\nin mutual orbit around their common center of mass.\n\nWith binoculars you can watch as R Aquarii\nsteadily changes its brightness over the course of a year or so.\n\nThe binary system's visible light is dominated by the red giant,\nitself a <a href=\"ap060722.html\">Mira</a>-type long period \n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/public\">variable star</a>.\n\nBut material in the cool giant star's extended envelope\nis pulled by gravity\nonto the surface of the smaller, denser white dwarf,\n<a href=\"ap060726.html\">eventually triggering</a>\na thermonuclear explosion, blasting material into space.\n\nAstronomers have seen such outbursts over recent decades.\n\nEvidence for much older outbursts is seen in\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/an-expanse-of-light.html\">these spectacular structures</a>\nspanning almost a light-year as\nobserved by the Hubble Space Telescope (in red and blue).\n\nData from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (in purple) shows\nthe X-ray glow from shock waves created as a jet from the white dwarf\nstrikes surrounding material.",
