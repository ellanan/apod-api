  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nRecorded on May 15/16 this sequence of exposures\nfollows the Full Moon during a total lunar eclipse as it arcs\nabove treetops in the clearing skies of central Florida.\n\nA frame taken every 5 minutes by a digital camera\nshows the progression of the eclipse over three hours.\n\nThe bright lunar disk grows dark and red as it\n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/news/172/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-lunar-eclipse/\">glides through planet Earth's shadow</a>.\n\nIn fact, counting the central frames in the sequence\nmeasures the roughly 90 minute\nduration of the total phase of this eclipse.\n\nAround 270 BC, the Greek astronomer\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos\">Aristarchus</a>\nalso measured the duration of total lunar eclipses,\nbut probably\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/54481-far-out-in-the-uncharted-backwaters-of-the-unfashionable-end\">without the benefit</a>\nof digital watches and cameras.\n\nStill,\n<a href=\"http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Shipprc2.htm\">using geometry</a> he\ndevised a simple and impressively accurate way to calculate\nthe Moon's distance in terms of the radius of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/\">planet Earth</a>,\nfrom the eclipse duration.",
