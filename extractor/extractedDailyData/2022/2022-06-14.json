  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are all those streaks across the background?\n\nSatellite trails.\n\nFirst, the foreground features picturesque rock mounds known as Pinnacles. \n\nFound in the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/7XOkWFIjz_M\">Nambung National Park</a> in Western \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, these human-sized spires are made by unknown processes from ancient sea shells \n(<a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2011-05-11-ct-x-c-fossils-in-chicagoland-buildin20110511-story.html\">limestone</a>).\n\nPerhaps more eye-catching, though, is the sky behind.\n\nCreated by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/leo-economy/faqs\">low-Earth orbit</a> \nsatellites reflecting sunlight, \nall of these streaks were captured in less than two hours \nand digitally combined onto \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CeA8Y5oLWfb/\">the single featured image</a>, with the foreground taken \nconsecutively by the same camera and from the same location. \n\nMost of the <a href=\"ap170221.html\">streaks</a> were made by the developing \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\">Starlink</a> \nconstellation of communication satellites, but some are not.\n\nIn general, the <a href=\"ap140525.html\">streaks</a> \nare indicative of an increasing number of \n<a href=\"ap210601.html\">satellites</a> nearly continuously visible above \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/\">the Earth</a> after dusk and before dawn. \n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/04/08/24/cat-4451003_1280.jpg\">Understanding</a> and \n<a href=\"ap191014.html\">removing</a> the effects of satellite trails on images from Earth's ground-based cameras and telescopes is now important not only for \n<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/starlink-satellites-are-photo-bombing-astronomy-images\">elegant astrophotography</a>, but for humanity's \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924L..30M/abstract\">scientific understanding</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap210802.html\">distant universe</a>.",
