  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nEverybody sees the Sun. \n\nNobody's been there. \n\nStarting in 2018, though, NASA \n<a href=\"ap180815.html\">launch</a>ed the robotic \n<a href=\"https://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/\">Parker Solar Probe</a> \n(PSP) to investigate regions near to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> for the first time. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14865\">featured time-lapse video</a> shows the view looking sideways from \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03665-3\">behind PSP</a>'s Sun shield in December during the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-parker-solar-probe-snaps-closest-ever-images-to-sun/\">closest approach</a> of any human-made spacecraft to the Sun, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe#Timeline\">looping down</a> to only about five solar diameters above the \n<a href=\"ap111106.html\">Sun's hot surface</a>.  \n\nThe PSP's Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe \n(<a href=\"https://wispr.nrl.navy.mil/\">WISPR</a>) cameras took these images over seven hours, but they are digitally compressed here into about 5 seconds. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap230516.html\">solar corona</a>, \nincluding colliding \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-coronal-mass-ejection-or-cme/\">coronal mass ejections</a> (CMEs), is visible here in \n<a href=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSQXmwoxMT4Txn3iwvV4PBzOc2O-WIVJ8wE-Q&amp;s\">unprecedented detail</a>, with stars \n<a href=\"ap240219.html\">passing</a> far in the background. \n\nThe Sun is not only Earth's dominant \n<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energy-sources?nrg_redirect=267706\">energy source</a>, but its variable \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">solar wind</a> also compresses Earth's atmosphere, triggers auroras, affects power grids, and can even \n<a href=\"https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/mission/science/the-impact-of-flares/index.html\">damage orbiting communication satellites</a>.",
