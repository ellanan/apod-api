  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat arm is 17 meters long and sometimes uses humans for fingers?   \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm2\">Canadarm2</a> aboard the \n<a href=\"ap060516.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS).  \n\nCanadarm2 has multiple joints and is capable of maneuvering \npayloads as massive as 116,000 kilograms, equivalent to a fully loaded bus.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/elements/mss/index.html\">Canadarm2</a> is operated by remote control by a human inside the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">space station</a>. \n\nTo help with tasks requiring a particularly high level of precision and detail, \nan astronaut can be anchored to an attached foot constraint.  \n\nThe arm is able <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchworm\">propel itself</a> \nend-over-end around the outside of the space station.\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-114/html/s114e6646.html\">Pictured above</a>, astronaut \n<a href=\"http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/robinson.html\">Stephen Robinson</a> \nrides Canadarm2 during the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/crew/index.html\">STS-114</a> \nmission of the <a href=\"ap050802.html\">space shuttle Discovery</a> \nto the ISS in 2005 August.   \n\nSpace shuttles often deploy their own original version of a \n<a href=\"http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/exploration/canadarm/backgrounder.asp\">robotic arm</a> dubbed \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm\">Canadarm</a>.\n\nNext year, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Robotic_Arm\">second robotic arm</a> is scheduled to be deployed on the space station.",
