  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTonight a bright full Moon will fade to red.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2&amp;v=vKAw_wrIr5s\">Tonight's moon</a> \nwill be particularly bright because it is reaching its fully lit phase \nwhen it is relatively close to the Earth in its \n<a href=\"http://www.cso.caltech.edu/outreach/log/NIGHT_DAY/elliptical.htm\">elliptical orbit</a>. \n\nIn fact, by some measures of size and brightness, tonight's full Moon is designated a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon\">supermoon</a>, although perhaps the \"super\" is \n<a href=\"http://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?key=1e6a1a1efdb011df84894040444cdc60&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBnXQFdZCMAAmw1H.jpg\">overstated</a> because it will be only a few percent larger and brighter than the average full Moon.\n\nHowever, our Moon will \n<a href=\"ap150408.html\">fade to a dim red</a> because it will also undergo a \n<a href=\"ap141005.html\">total lunar eclipse</a> -- \nan episode when the Moon becomes completely engulfed in Earth's shadow.\n\nThe faint \n<a href=\"ap140418.html\">red</a> color results from \nblue sunlight being more strongly scattered away by the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXMZmEOGLRc\">Tonight's moon</a> \ncan also be called a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon#Harvest_moon\">Harvest Moon</a> as it is the full Moon that occurs closest to the September \n<a href=\"ap140319.html\">equinox</a>, a time signaling crop harvest in Earth's northern hemisphere.\n\nTotal eclipses of supermoons are relatively rare -- the last \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/Gallery/SupermoonLunarEclipseSeptember2015.html\">supermoon lunar eclipse</a> was in 1982, and the next will be in 2033.\n\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/22sep_lunareclipse/\">Tonight's supermoon total eclipse</a> will last over an hour and be \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2015Sep28T.pdf\">best visible</a> from eastern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a> after sunset, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America\">South America</a> in the middle of the night, and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe\">Western Europe</a> before sunrise.",
