  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday, \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/comet_bradfield_040313.html\">Comet Bradfield</a> is passing the Sun.  \n\nThe above image, taken yesterday in the direction of the \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/mission/page1.html\">SOHO</a> \n<a href=\"http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/about_lasco.html\">LASCO</a> \ninstrument, shows the comet and its \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/tail.html\">dust tail</a> \nas the elongated white streak.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a> \nwould normally be seen in the very center but has been \nblocked from view.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2004F4.html\">Comet C/2004 F4 (Bradfield)</a> was discovered \njust one month ago and has brightened dramatically \nas it neared the Sun.  \n\nCareful sky gazers can see \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2004f4.html\">Comet Bradfield</a> \nwith the unaided eye near the Sun, although \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \nsun-orbiting SOHO satellite has the best view.  \n\nDuring the day,\nComet Bradfield will continually shift inside the \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/pickoftheweek/\">LASCO frame</a> as it rounds the Sun.  \n\nThere is even the possibility that the comet will \n<a href=\"ap000808.html\">break up</a>. \n\nIf not, the bright comet's trajectory will carry it \noutside the field of LASCO sometime tomorrow.  \n\nAlong with <a href=\"ap040209.html\">T7</a> and \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2001q4.html\">Q4</a>, \nComet Bradfield is now the \n<i><a href=\"http://space.com/spacewatch/comet_update_040416.html\">third</a></i> comet that is currently visible \non the sky with the unaided eye, the most ever of which we are aware \nand quite possibly the most in \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/press/pr0409.html\">recorded</a> \nhistory.",
