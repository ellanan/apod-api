  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe rock formation in the foreground of this night view\nwas recorded on August 10,\nilluminated by light from a waning gibbous Moon.\n\n<a href=\"ap060811.html\">Even though</a> the sky above also\nscatters the bright moonlight, a brilliant meteor was captured as it flashed\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/meteors/gallery_12aug06.htm\">across\nthe scene</a> during the 30 second long exposure.\n\nOf course, the meteor was part of the\n<a href=\"ap050806.html\">annual rain</a> of dust from\nperiodic Comet <a href=\"ap960219.html\">Swift-Tuttle</a> known as the\n<a href=\"http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/\nperseidhistory.html\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>.\n\nLeaving trails that point back to a\n<a href=\"http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/\nperseids.html\">radiant</a> in the\nconstellation Perseus, the\n<a href=\"http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/\nabout.php\">ancient dust</a> particles are\nvaporized as they enter the atmosphere at about 60 kilometers\nper second, their visible streaks beginning at altitudes\nof around 100 kilometers.\n\nAnd though it looks like the knuckles of a giant hand,\nthe curious rock formation can be\nfound in Colorado National Monument park, USA,\n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/colm/\">planet Earth</a>.",
