  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere is a road that connects the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)\">Northern</a> to the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross\">Southern Cross</a> \nbut you have to be at the right place and time to see it.\n\nThe road, as pictured here, is actually the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy; the right place, in this case, is dark \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/TRIdvFmIlFU\">Laguna Cejar</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Atacama\">Salar de Atacama</a> of Northern \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>; \nand the right time was in early October, just after sunset.\n\nMany sky wonders were captured then, including the \n<a href=\"ap110711.html\">bright Moon</a>, inside the \n<a href=\"ap100913.html\">Milky Way</a> arch;  \n<a href=\"ap130512.html\">Venus</a>, just above the Moon; \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> and \n<a href=\"ap130219.html\">Mercury</a>, just below the Moon; \nthe \n<a href=\"ap180428.html\">Large and Small Magellanic Clouds</a> \nsatellite galaxies, on the far left; \nred <a href=\"ap130619.html\">airglow</a> near the horizon on the image left; \nand the lights of small towns at several locations across the \n<a href=\"ap171205.html\">horizon</a>. \n\nOne might guess that composing \n<a href=\"http://www.nicholasbuer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CHILE_4.jpg\">this 30-image panorama</a> would have been a serene experience, \nbut for that one would have required earplugs to ignore the continued \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uanE7YxW0E\">brays</a> of wild \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey\">donkey</a>s.",
