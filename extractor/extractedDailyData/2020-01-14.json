  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAre volcanoes still active on Venus? \n\nMore <a href=\"ap190729.html\">volcanoes</a> are known on Venus than Earth, \nbut when \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/\">Venus</a>ian volcanoes last erupted is not directly known.\n\n<a href=\"https://newsroom.usra.edu/scientists-find-evidence-that-venus-has-active-volcanoes\">Evidence bolstering</a> very recent volcanism on Venus has recently been uncovered, though, right here on Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/1/eaax7445\">Lab results showed</a> that images of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddzU-rkzKF0\">surface lava</a> \nwould become dim in the infrared in only months in the dense Venusian atmosphere, \na dimming not seen in ESA's \n<a href=\"https://astronomynow.com/2016/10/19/recently-active-lava-flows-from-volcano-idunn-mons-on-venus/\">Venus Express images</a>.\n\nVenus Express entered orbit around \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Surface_geology\">Venus</a> in 2006 and \n<a href=\"https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dog-on-phone_yy9dow.jpeg\">remained in contact</a> with Earth until 2014.\n\nTherefore, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> \nglow (shown in false-color red) recorded by Venus Express for \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA13001\">Idunn Mons</a> and featured here on a NASA \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/magellan/\">Magellan</a> image \nindicates that this volcano erupted very recently -- and is still active today. \n\nUnderstanding the \n<a href=\"ap190527.html\">volcanics</a> of \n<a href=\"ap960624.html\">Venus</a> might lead to insight about the \n<a href=\"ap170426.html\">volcanics</a> on Earth, as well as \n<a href=\"ap970915.html\">elsewhere</a> \n<a href=\"ap171009.html\">in</a> \n<a href=\"ap050610.html\">our</a> \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a>.",
