  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDespite clouds and rain showers astronomer Phillip Perkins managed\nto spot a reddened,\n<a href=\"ap040506.html\">eclipsed Moon</a> between the stones of this\nwell known <a href=\"http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~scia17/\nlectures/#B\">monument to the Sun</a> during May's total lunar eclipse,\n<a href=\"http://www.thestonehengeproject.org/about/\nindex.shtml\">from Stonehenge</a>, England.\n\nWhen he recorded\n<a href=\"http://www.astrocruise.com/l_eclipse.htm\">this dramatic\npicture</a>, the rising Moon was\nonly about 5 degrees above the horizon, but conveniently\nlocated through a gap in the\n<a href=\"http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/stonehenge/\nstonehenge.html\">circle of ancient stones</a>.\n\nAlthough at first glance there appears to be an eerie,\nluminous pool of water in the foreground, Perkins notes that his\ndaughter produced the artistic lighting effect.\n\nShe illuminated a fallen stone and surrounding grass with a\nflashgun from her hiding place behind the large\n<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/filestore/\nstonehengegallery2/gallery/gallery.asp?currentSlide=5\">sarsen\nstone</a> to the right of center.\n\nAs the picture looks toward the southeast, the stone just below\nthe Moon is one of the inner bluestones rather than\nthe <a href=\"http://witcombe.sbc.edu/earthmysteries/\nEMStonehengeD.html\">famous Heel Stone</a>, which marks the\nnortheast direction of the <a href=\"ap020621.html\">summer solstice</a>\nsunrise.",
