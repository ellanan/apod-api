  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhat's that strange light down the road?\n\n<a href=\"ap010813.html\">Dust</a> orbiting the Sun.\n\nAt certain times of the year, a band of sun-reflecting dust from the inner \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/solarsystem/needtoknow\">Solar System</a> appears prominently just after sunset -- or just before sunrise -- and is called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light\">zodiacal light</a>. \n\nAlthough the origin of this dust is still being researched, \na leading hypothesis holds that zodiacal dust originates mostly from faint \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/J/Jupiter-family+Comets\">Jupiter-family comets</a> and slowly spirals into the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sun\">Sun</a>.\n\nRecent analysis of \n<a href=\"ap151118.html\">dust emitted by Comet 67P</a>, \nvisited by ESA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Europe_s_comet_chaser\">Rosetta spacecraft</a>, bolster this hypothesis. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rmsphotography95/photos/a.386953088074201/1837984689637693/?type=3&amp;theater\">Pictured</a> when climbing a road up to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5juqIAf0ik\">Teide National Park</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, \na bright triangle of \n<a href=\"ap171010.html\">zodiacal light</a> \nappeared in the distance soon after sunset.\n\nCaptured on June 21, the scene includes bright Regulus, alpha star of\nLeo, standing above center toward the left.\n\nThe Beehive Star Cluster (M44) can be spotted below center, closer to the\nhorizon and also immersed in the zodiacal glow.",
