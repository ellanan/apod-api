  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nPhobos is doomed.\n<a href=\"ap950716.html\">Mars</a>, the red planet named for the Roman god of war, has two tiny moons,\nPhobos and\n<a href=\"ap951003.html\">Deimos</a>,\nwhose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic.\n\nThese <a href=\"ap950717.html\">Martian</a>\nmoons may well be captured <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">asteroids</a> originating\nin the asteroid belt between <a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/mars.htm\">Mars</a> and <a href=\"ap950625.html\">Jupiter</a>\nor perhaps from even more\ndistant reaches of the <a href=\"ap980517.html\">Solar System</a>.\nIn this 1977 Viking orbiter image, the largest moon,\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/phobos.html\">Phobos</a>, is seen to be a heavily cratered asteroid-like object.\n\nIt is about 17 miles across and zips through the Martian sky completing an\norbit in less than 8 hours.  Phobos orbits so close to Mars,\n(about 3,600 miles above the surface compared to 250,000 miles for our\n<a href=\"ap950629.html\">Moon</a>)\nthat gravitational tidal forces are dragging it down.  In 100 million\nyears or so it should crash into the surface or be shattered by stress\ncaused by the relentless tidal forces, the debris forming a ring around\nMars.",
