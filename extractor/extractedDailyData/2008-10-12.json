  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs this what our own Milky Way Galaxy looks like from far away?\n\nSimilar in size and grand design to our \n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">home Galaxy</a> \n(although without the central bar), spiral galaxy \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3370\">NGC 3370</a> \nlies about 100 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> \naway toward the constellation of the Lion \n(<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/leo.htm\">Leo</a>). \n\nRecorded \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/24/image/a/\">above</a> in exquisite detail by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/the_story.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a>, \nthe big, beautiful face-on spiral is not only photogenic, but has proven \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/24/video/a/\">sharp</a> enough to study individual stars known as \n<a href=\"ap960110.html\">Cepheids</a>.\n\nThese <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable\">pulsating stars</a> have been used to accurately determine NGC 3370's distance.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/gallery/pzgallery/0324m.shtml\">NGC 3370</a> was chosen for this study because in 1994 the \n<a href=\"http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/proj/basic/galaxies/spirals.asp\">spiral galaxy</a> was also home to a well studied stellar explosion -- a \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/universe/supernova1a_nf_01.html\">Type Ia supernova</a>. \n\nCombining the known distance to this \n<a href=\"http://www.starstryder.com/2007/10/03/type-1a-supernoave-a-non-standard-candle/\">standard candle</a> supernova, \nbased on the Cepheid measurements, with observations of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8srN24pSQ\">supernovas</a> at even greater distances, \nhas helped to reveal the size and \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~huchra/hubble/\">expansion rate</a> \nof the entire Universe itself.",
