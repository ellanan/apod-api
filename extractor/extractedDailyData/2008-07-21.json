  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat will become of these galaxies?\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">Spiral galaxies</a> \nNGC 5426 and NGC 5427 are passing dangerously close to each other, \nbut each is likely to survive this collision.  \n\nMost frequently when \n<a href=\"ap080224.html\">galaxies collide</a>, \na large galaxy eats a much smaller galaxy.\n\nIn this case, however, the two galaxies are quite similar, each being a \n<a href=\"ap040125.html\">sprawling spiral</a> with expansive arms and a compact core.    \n\nAs the galaxies advance over the next tens of millions of years, their component stars are unlikely to collide, although new stars will form in the bunching of gas caused by \n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/Gravity/tides.html\">gravitational tides</a>.  \n\nClose inspection of the \n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/10979\">above image</a> taken by the 8-meter \n<a href=\"ap030909.html\">Gemini-South Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a> shows a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_suspension_bridges\">bridge</a> of material momentarily connecting the two giants.  \n\nKnown collectively as \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...415..451F\">Arp 271</a>, \nthe interacting pair spans about 130,000 \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> and lies about 90 million light-years away toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/virgo.html\">Virgo</a>.\n\nQuite possibly, our \n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> will undergo a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda-Milky_Way_collision\">similar collision</a> with the neighboring \n<a href=\"http://www.solstation.com/x-objects/andromeda.htm\">Andromeda Galaxy</a> in about five billion years.",
