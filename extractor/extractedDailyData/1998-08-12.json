  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"http://muttley.ucdavis.edu/Book/Vehicles/instructor/gliders-01.html\">Daedalus warned Icarus</a> that if he flew too high, \nthe Sun would melt his wings. \n\nApparently, nobody gave the <a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Projects/erast/Projects/Pathfinder/pathfinder.html\">ERAST Pathfinder-Plus aircraft</a> a similar warning.  \n\nEarlier this month, not only did \n<a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PAO/PressReleases/1998/98-64.html\">Pathfinder-Plus fly higher</a> than any previous propeller-driven aircraft - \nits wings converted sunlight into power.  <a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/Pathfinder-Plus/Small/index.html\">Pictured</a>, Pathfinder-Plus is flying above \n<a href=\"ap980725.html\">Hawaii</a> \nsoon after soaring to a record height of 24,700 meters.  \n\nWhat's more, Pathfinder-Plus is only a prototype -- future aircraft in the \n<a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Projects/erast/erasth.html\">ERAST program</a> may fly higher.  Pathfinder's wings spread nearly 30 meters, and its total mass is only about 270 kilograms.  \n<a href=\"http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/ERAST/pathfinder/index.html\">NASA's Pathfinder-Plus</a> \nis flown by remote control, and can stay aloft for weeks at a time.",
