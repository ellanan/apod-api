  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nM44 is a prominent \n<a href=\"ap970128.html\">open cluster</a> of stars.  Nicknamed \nPraesepe and \"The Beehive\", it is one of the few \n<a href=\"ap971018.html\">open clusters</a> <a href=\"http://www.campus.bt.com/CampusWorld/pub/ScienceNet/astron/const/Cancer/m44.html\">visible</a> to the unaided eye.  \n<a href=\" http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m044.html\">M44</a> \nwas thought to be a \n<a href=\"ap980612.html\">nebula</a> until \n<a href=\"ap960830.html\">Galileo</a> \nused an early telescope to resolve the \ncluster's bright blue stars.  These stars are visible in the\n<a href=\"http://www.psn.net/~airdigital/deepsky_photos_1.html\">above image</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m044_more.html\">M44</a>, which is thought to have formed \nabout 400 million years ago, is larger and older than most \n<a href=\"index/OpenCluster.html\">other open clusters</a>.  \n\nThe Beehive Cluster lies about 580 light-years away, \nand spans about 10 light-years across.  \nWhen viewed with a powerful telescope, \nhundreds of stars become visible.",
