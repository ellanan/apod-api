  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe layers of the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/38/b5.html\">Saturn Nebula</a> \ngive a complex picture of how this \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebula</a> \nwas created.  The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/38/b-js.html\">above picture</a>, \ntaken in April 1996 and released last week, \nallows a better understanding of the mysterious process that \ntransformed a low-mass star into a \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf star</a>.  \nA computer model indicates that the central star of \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/n7009.caption.html\">NGC 7009</a> first expelled the green gas that now appears barrel shaped.  \nThis green gas now confines stellar winds flowing from the central star, \ncreating a jet which forms the \n<a href=\"ap961122.html\">ansae</a> that appear in red at the tips.  \nMuch remains unknown, including why the gas has not become \n<a href=\"http://jcbmac.chem.brown.edu/scissorsHtml/liquids/turbulence.html\">turbulent</a>.",
