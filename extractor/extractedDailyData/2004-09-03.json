  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA major hurricane is heading for \n<a href=\"http://www.state.fl.us\">Florida</a>.  \n\nHurricane <a href=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/2004/0831frances.html\">Frances</a>, one of the stronger storm systems of modern times, \nmay cross the eastern coast of Florida sometime tomorrow.  \n\nThose in the path of a \n<a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqHED.html\">hurricane</a> should take precautions.  \n\nFor example, <a href=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/\">NASA's Kennedy Space Center</a> has completely \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/frances.html\">shut down</a>.  \n\nThe orbiting \n<a href=\"http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/goes/\">GOES-12</a> satellite took the \n<a href=\"http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/index.cgi?page=items&amp;ser=108128\">above image</a> of Hurricane Frances early yesterday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html\">Hurricanes</a> are \n<a href=\"ap960920.html\">huge swirling storms</a> with cloud systems typically larger than a state. \n\nTropical cyclones, called \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/frances_ISS.html\">hurricanes</a> in Earth's Western Hemisphere and \n<a href=\"ap970819.html\">typhoons</a> in the Eastern Hemisphere, get their immense energy from warm evaporated ocean water. \n\nAs this water vapor cools and condenses, it heats the air, \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/hurricane.htm\">lowers pressure</a> and hence causes cooler air to come swooshing in. \n\nWinds can reach over 250 kilometers per hour and become \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/miami/peopleevents/pande07.html\">very dangerous</a>. \n\nMuch remains unknown about cyclones, including \n<a href=\"http://www.comet.ucar.edu/nsflab/web/hurricane/312.htm\">how they are formed</a> and the exact path they will take.",
