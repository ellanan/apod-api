  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nToday, at about 3 pm EST, the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/media/EoM.html\">first human-made spacecraft is scheduled to touchdown</a> \non an <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>.  \n\nAt an impact speed of 8 kilometers per hour, \nit is most probable that the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/intro/faq.html\">robot spacecraft NEAR-Shoemaker</a> \nwill not survive its \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/media/eom_events/index.html\">planned collision</a> with \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/eros/sum.html\">433 Eros</a>.  \n\nA primary reason for the descent, \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20010208/index.html\">diagrammed above</a>, will be to take images during the \nfour hours on the way down.  \n\nIf all goes well, some of those pictures will show \n<a href=\"ap001027.html\">surface features</a> \nas small as 10 centimeters across.  \n\nScientists hope to learn more about this unusual \n<a href=\"ap951119.html\">Manhattan</a>-sized rock that is, \nquite possibly, older than the \n<a href=\"ap001127.html\">Earth</a>.",
