  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nComet McNaught, the Great Comet of 2007, was the brightest comet of the last 40 years.  \n\nIts spectacular\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/tail.html&amp;edu=high\">tail</a> spread across the sky and was breathtaking to behold from dark locations for many Southern Hemisphere observers.  \n\nThe head of the\n<a href=\"http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/SegWayEd/lessons/cometstale/com.html\">comet</a> remained quite bright and was\n<a href=\"http://msowww.anu.edu.au/~rmn/C2006P1new.htm\">easily visible</a>\nto even city observers without any optical aide.  \n\nPart of the\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_mcnaught_page11.htm\">spectacular tail</a> was visible just above the horizon after\nsunset for many northern observers as well.  \n\nComet C/2006 P1 (McNaught), which reached an\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2006P1/2006P1.html\">estimated</a> peak brightness of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude\">magnitude</a> -6 (minus six),  was caught by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._McNaught\">comet's discoverer</a> in the\n<a href=\"http://msowww.anu.edu.au/~rmn/C2006P1.htm\">above image</a> soon after sunset in 2007 January from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siding_Spring_Observatory\">Siding Spring Observatory</a> in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>.\n\nThe robotic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(spacecraft)\">Ulysses spacecraft</a> fortuitously flew through\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_McNaught\">Comet McNaught</a>'s\ntail and found, unexpectedly, that the speed of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind\">solar wind</a>\ndropped significantly.",
