  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/\nsmallest-full-moon-of-year-and-penumbral-eclipse-november-28\">Did\nyou see</a> the big, bright, beautiful Full Moon Wednesday night?\n\nThat was actually a Micro Moon!\n\nOn that night, the smallest Full Moon of 2012 reached its full phase only\nabout <a href=\"http://fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html\">4 hours before\napogee</a>, the most distant point from Earth in the\nMoon's elliptical orbit.\n\nOf course, earlier this year on May 6,\na Full Super Moon was near perigee, the closest\n<a href=\"http://fourmilab.ch/earthview/moon_ap_per.html\">point\nin its orbit</a>.\n\nThe relative <a href=\"ap080801.html\">apparent size</a> of November 28's\nMicro Moon (right) is compared to the famous\n<a href=\"ap120511.html\">May 6 Super Moon</a> in these two panels,\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosnake.com/gallery/moon.htm\">matching\ntelescopic images</a> from Bucharest, Romania.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.gr/\nAstro-Lunar-Scenes-Apo-Perigee-2010.htm\">The difference</a>\nin apparent size represents a difference in distance\nof just under 50,000 kilometers between apogee and perigee, given\nthe Moon's average distance of about 385,000 kilometers.\n\nHow long do you have to wait to see another Full Micro Moon?\n\nUntil January 16, 2014, when the lunar full phase will occur within\nabout 3 hours of apogee.",
