  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does this Martian rock have so much zinc?\n\nRoughly the size and shape of a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PefS8tY_gnI\">tilted</a> coffee-table, this oddly flat, light-topped rock outcropping was chanced upon a few weeks ago by the \n<a href=\"http://marsrover.nasa.gov/overview/\">robotic Opportunity rover</a> currently rolling across Mars.\n\nEarly last month Opportunity reached \n<a href=\"ap110815.html\">Endeavour crater</a>, the largest surface feature it has ever encountered, and is now exploring Endeavour's rim for clues about how \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_on_Mars\">wet Mars</a> \nwas billions of years ago.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14748\">Pictured above</a> and named \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/88571/nasa-robot-arrives-at-%E2%80%98new%E2%80%99-landing-site-holding-clues-to-ancient-water-flow-on-mars/\">Tisdale 2</a>, the unusual rock structure was probed by \n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">Opportunity</a> last week and is now thought to be a remnant thrown off during the impact that created nearby \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/pia11510.html\">Odyssey crater</a>.\n\nThe resulting chemical analysis of \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14749\">Tisdale 2</a>, however, has shown it to have a \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14747\">strangely high</a> amount of the element \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc\">zinc</a>.\n\nThe reason for this is currently unknown, but might turn out to be a clue to the history of the entire region.\n\nOpportunity is already finding rocks older than any previously studied and will \n<a href=\"http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_opportunityAll.html#sol2703\">continue to explore</a> several other \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14539\">intriguing rock formations</a> only now \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZhmePA5r24\">glimpsed</a> from a distance.",
