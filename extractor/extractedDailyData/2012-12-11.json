  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nStars are sometimes born in the midst of chaos. \n\nAbout 3 million years ago in the nearby galaxy \n<a href=\"ap030924.html\">M33</a>, a large cloud of gas \nspawned dense internal knots which gravitationally \ncollapsed to form stars. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m033_n604.html\">NGC 604</a> was so large, however, it could form enough stars to make a \n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular cluster</a>. \n\nMany young stars from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elsz-YtGyPk\">this cloud</a> are <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2003/30/image/\">visible</a> in the \n<a href=\"http://www.waid-observatory.com/NGC0604-2012-09-30-HLA.html\">above image</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nalong with what is left of the initial \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2003/30/supplemental.html\">gas cloud</a>. \n\nSome stars were so massive they have already \nevolved and exploded in a \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap021102.html\">brightest stars</a> that are left emit light \nso energetic that they create one of the largest clouds of \n<a href=\"ap030410.html\">ionized hydrogen</a> gas known, \ncomparable to the \n<a href=\"ap030823.html\">Tarantula Nebula</a> in our \n<a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_milky.html\">Milky Way</a>'s close neighbor, the \n<a href=\"ap010804.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.",
