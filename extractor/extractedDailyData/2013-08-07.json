  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's going on behind that mountain?\n\nQuite a bit. \n\nFirst of all, the mountain itself, named \n<a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkjufell\">Kirkjufell</a>, \nis quite old and located in western Iceland near the town of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundarfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur\">Grundarfj�r�ur</a>.\n\nIn front of the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h49jmcqPQQ4\">steeply-sloped structure</a> lies a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord\">fjord</a> that had just \nbegun to freeze when the above image was taken -- in mid-December of 2012.\n\nAlthough quite faint to the \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/cow_eye/\">unaided eye</a>, \nthe beautiful \n<a href=\"http://odin.gi.alaska.edu/FAQ/#color\">colors</a> of \n<a href=\"ap121017.html\">background aurorae</a> \nbecame quite apparent on the 25-second exposure.\n\nWhat makes <a href=\"http://www.imagesinspiredbynature.com/Gallery%20Night%20Skies.html\">this image</a> is of particular note, though, is that it also captures streaks from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids\">Geminids</a> meteor shower -- \nmeteors that might not have been evident were the aurora much brighter.\n\nFar in the distance, on the left, is the \n<a href=\"ap110710.html\">band</a> of our Milky Way Galaxy, while \n<a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100502114646AAsPqHC\">stars</a> from our local part of the \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way</a> \nappear spread across the background. \n\nThis weekend the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseids</a> \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/10aug_perseids/\">meteor</a> \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/perseids.cfm\">shower</a> \nwill peak and may well provide \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky\">sky</a> enthusiasts with their own \n<a href=\"ap120425.html\">memorable visual experiences</a>.",
