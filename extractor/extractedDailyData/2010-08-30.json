  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCould life once have survived on Mars?\n\nToday, neither\n<a href=\"http://tolweb.org/tree/\">animal</a> nor\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant\">plant</a> life from\n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> could survive for very long on\n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a> because at least one key ingredient -- liquid\n<a href=\"ap980530.html\">water</a> -- is essentially absent on the red planet's rusty surface.\n\nAlthough evidence from the\n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html\">martian rovers</a> indicates that long ago\n<a href=\"ap040303.html\">Mars might</a> once have had\nliquid water on its surface, that water might also have been\n<a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/list_6383560_dangers-acidic-water.html\">too acidic</a> for familiar life forms to thrive.  \n\nRecently, however, a newly detailed analysis of an unusual outcropping of rock and soil chanced upon in 2005 by the robotic\n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">Spirit rover</a> has uncovered a clue indicating that not all of Mars was always so acidic.\n\nThe mound  in question, dubbed\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/pia10126-label.html\">Comanche</a> Outcrop and visible near the top of the\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13175\">above image</a>, appears to contain unusually\nhigh concentrations of elements such as magnesium iron\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate\">carbonate</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13175\">above image</a> is shown in colors exaggerated to highlight the differences in composition.\n\nSince these\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonates_on_Mars\">carbonates</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDBWUV6aTQE\">dissolve</a> in acid, the persistence of these mounds indicates that water perhaps less\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid\">acidic</a> and more\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=diploma-3\">favorable for life</a> might have once flowed across Mars.\n\nMore detailed analyses and searches for other signs will surely continue.",
