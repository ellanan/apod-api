  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening in the sky above Stonehenge?\n\nA meteor shower: specifically, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/\">Perseid meteor shower</a>.\n\nA few nights ago, after the \n<a href=\"ap240228.html\">sky darkened</a>, \nmany images of meteors from this year's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseids</a> were captured separately and merged into a single frame.\n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"ap240811.html\">meteors all</a> traveled on straight paths, these paths appear slightly curved by the wide-angle lens of the capturing camera.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap161213.html\">meteor streaks</a> \ncan all be traced back to a single point on the sky called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(meteor_shower)\">radiant</a>, \nhere just off the top of the frame in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)\">constellation of Perseus</a>.\n\nThe same camera took a deep image of the background sky that brought up the \n<a href=\"ap240805.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way galaxy</a> running nearly vertical through the image center.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-hUGnvsliD/\">featured image</a> was taken from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6rUFClgsrnQ\">Wiltshire</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England\">England</a>, \nbeing careful to include, at the bottom, the famous astronomical monument of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge\">Stonehenge</a>.\n\nAlthough the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/night-sky-network/prepare-for-perseids/\">Perseids</a> peaked last night, \nsome Perseid meteors should <a href=\"https://i.chzbgr.com/full/8572855808/hBCCED02B/cute-cat-hiding-hey-whered-she-go\">still be visible</a> for a few more nights.",
