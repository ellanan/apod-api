  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen the night sky change?\n\nIt does -- sometimes in beautiful and unexpected ways.\n\nTo see it, though, usually requires patience.\n\nThe above \n<a href=\"http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/astrofest/awards/\">award winning</a> \nvideo shows several of the possible changes in dramatic fashion with a time lapse video.\n\nVisible are sunset-illuminated \n<a href=\"ap110516.html\">clouds moving</a>, stars of vivid \n<a href=\"ap021225.html\">colors rising</a>, the long tail of a \n<a href=\"ap111228.html\">Comet Lovejoy</a> rising, bright \n<a href=\"ap110314.html\">satellites crossing</a>, a \n<a href=\"ap011118.html\">meteor exploding</a>, a distant lightning \n<a href=\"ap110618.html\">storm approaching</a>, skyscapes including the \n<a href=\"ap980203.html\">Magellanic Clouds</a> rotating, and a \n<a href=\"ap020310.html\">fisheye sky</a> rotating while the foreground becomes \nilluminated by moonlight.\n\nFrequently featuring an artistic human sculpture in the foreground \nand the southern sky in the background, \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45856570\">the video</a> closes with a time lapse clip of a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse\">total lunar eclipse</a>.\n\nIf you can identify any more of the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky\">sky</a> events depicted -- \nor any of the landscapes shown -- please illuminate them with \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=120806\">a comment</a>.",
