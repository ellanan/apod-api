  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNGC 134 is probably not the best known spiral galaxy in the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nSculptor_%28constellation%29#Notable_features\">constellation Sculptor</a>.\n\nStill, the tantalizing island universe is a clearly a\ntelescopic treasure in southern skies.\n\nIt shares a bright core, clumpy dust lanes, and loosely wrapped\nspiral arms with spiky foreground stars of the Milky Way and the\nmore diminutive galaxy NGC 131 in\n<a href=\"http://www.chart32.de/index.php/component/k2/item/198\">this\nsharp cosmic vista</a>.\n\nFrom a distance of about 60 million light-years,\nNGC 134 is seen tilted nearly edge-on.\n\nIt spans some 150,000 light-years, making it even larger than our\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/\ncharting-the-milky-way-from-the-inside-out\">own Milky Way</a> galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/usa/images/eso0749a/\">NGC 134's</a>\nwarped disk and faint extensions give the\nappearance of past gravitational interactions with neighboring\ngalaxies.\n\nLike the much closer and brighter Sculptor\n<a href=\"ap140726.html\">galaxy NGC 253</a>, tendrils of dust\nappear to rise from a galactic disk sprinkled with blue star clusters\nand pinkish star forming regions.",
