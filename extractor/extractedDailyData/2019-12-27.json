  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happened to the Sun? \n\nYesterday, if you were in the right place at the right time, you could see the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> \nrise partially eclipsed by the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">Moon</a>.\n\nThe unusual sight was captured in dramatic fashion in the featured image not only directly, in a sequence of six images, but also in reflection from \n<a href=\"https://persiadigest.com/en/news/6327/the-largest-natural-mirror-in-iran-photos\">Soltan Salt Lake</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\">Iran</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://solar-center.stanford.edu/SID/activities/GreenSun.html\">almost-white Sun</a> appears dimmer and \n<a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/46-our-solar-system/the-moon/observing-the-moon/142-why-are-the-moon-and-sun-sometimes-orange-or-red-beginner\">redder near the horizon</a> primarily because \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> preferentially scatters away more blue light. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2019\">Yesterday's partial solar eclipse</a> appeared in the sky over much of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia\">Asia</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, but those with a clear enough sky in a thin band across the Earth's surface were treated to a more complete \n<a href=\"ap170302.html\">annular solar eclipse</a> -- where the \n<a href=\"ap170301.html\">Moon appears completely surrounded by the Sun</a> in what is known as a \n<a href=\"ap090125.html\">ring of fire</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_June_21,_2020\">next annular solar eclipse</a> will occur in 2020 June.",
