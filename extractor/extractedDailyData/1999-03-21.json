  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAre stars better appreciated for their art after they die?  \nActually, stars usually create their most artistic displays <i>as</i> they die.  \nIn the case of low-mass stars like our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> and \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/38/a.html\">M2-9 pictured above</a>, \nthe stars transform themselves from normal stars to \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarfs</a> \nby casting off their outer gaseous envelopes.  \n\nThe expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebula</a> that fades gradually over thousand of years.  <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997A%26A%2E%2E%2E319%2E%2E267S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">M2-9</a>, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in\nrepresentative colors, \nhas wings that tell a strange but \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/38/pr.html\">incomplete tale</a>.  In the center, two stars orbit inside a \ngaseous disk 10 times the orbit of \n<a href=\"ap990213.html\">Pluto</a>.  \nThe expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the \ndisk creating the \n<a href=\"ap971021.html\">bipolar appearance</a>.  \nMuch remains unknown about the physical processes that cause \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebulae</a>.",
