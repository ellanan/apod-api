  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but have you seen a <i> movie </i> of Jupiter and Saturn's Great Conjunction?\n\nThe featured time-lapse video was composed from a series of images taken from <a href=\"http://narit.or.th/\">Thailand</a> and shows the two giant planets as they angularly passed about a tenth of a degree from each other. \n\nThe first <a href=\"ap201223.html\">Great Conjunction</a> sequence shows a relative close up over five days with moons and cloud bands easily visible, followed by a second video sequence, zoomed out, over 9 days. \n\nEven though <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> and <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> appeared to pass unusually <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)\">close together</a> on the sky on <a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201221.html\">December 21, 2020</a>, in actuality they were still nearly a <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/great-jupiter-saturn-conjunction-dec-21-2020\">billion kilometers</a> apart. \n\nThe two gas giants are destined for similar <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-great-conjunction-of-jupiter-and-saturn\">meet ups</a> every <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/planets/great-conjunction\">19.86 years</a>. \n\nHowever, they had not come <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction\">this close</a>, angularly, for the past <a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/the-buzz/article/what-happened-the-last-time-saturn-jupiter-aligned-history-and-the-great-conjunction-from/697290\">397 years</a>, and will not again for another <a href=\"https://www.space.com/rare-great-conjunction-jupiter-saturn-2020-wows-skywatchers\">60 years</a>. \n\nIf you're <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/67/23/08/6723087fa7d9e91bfe4b96b858858150.jpg\">willing to wait</a> until the year \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction#7541\">7541</a>, \nthough, you can see Jupiter  \n<a href=\"https://sparky.rice.edu/public-night/jupsat2.html\">pass</a> directly in front of Saturn.",
