  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFor billions of years,\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm_lc/edu/lessons/\nbackground-lifecycles.html\">massive stars</a> in our Milky Way\nGalaxy have lived spectacular lives. \n\nCollapsing from vast <a href=\"ap020530.html\">cosmic\nclouds</a>, their nuclear furnaces\nignite and create heavy elements in their cores.\n\nAfter a few million years, the\n<a href=\"ap011026.html\">enriched material</a> is blasted\nback into interstellar space where star formation\nbegins anew.\n\nThe expanding debris cloud known\n<a href=\"http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/%7Etrector/cas_a/\">as\nCassiopeia A</a> is an example\nof this final phase of the stellar life cycle.\n\nLight from the explosion which created this supernova remnant was\nprobably first\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/Vars/casA.html\">seen\nin planet Earth's sky</a> just over 300 years ago,\nalthough it took that light more than 10,000 years to reach us.\n\nIn this gorgeous\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/15/\npr-photos.html\">Hubble Space Telescope image</a> of cooling filaments\nand knots in <a href=\"ap000103.html\">the Cas A</a> remnant, light\nfrom specific elements has been color coded to help astronomers\nunderstand the recycling of our galaxy's\n<a href=\"ap020104.html\">star stuff</a>.\n\nFor instance, red regions are dominated by emission from sulfur atoms\nwhile blue shades correspond to oxygen.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/15/table.html#facts\">The\narea shown</a> is about 10 light-years across.",
