  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see?\n\nThe answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video \ntaken during the total lunar\n<a href=\"ap250315.html\">eclipse last week</a> from\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay\">Uruguay</a>.\n\nDuring a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse#Total_lunar_eclipse\">total lunar eclipse</a>, the Earth moves between the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a> and the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>, \ncausing the Moon to fade dramatically.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap211201.html\">Moon never gets completely dark</a>, \nthough, since the Earth's atmosphere\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/refr.html\">refracts</a> some light.\n\nAs the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon.\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a> \nbecomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become \nvisible.\n\nMost spectacularly, the\n<a href=\"ap110617.html\">sky surrounding</a> the eclipsed moon\nsuddenly appears to be\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1DNbkKBW0K8\">full of stars</a> \nand highlighted by the busy plane of our\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nNearly two hours after the eclipse started, \nthe Moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full \n<a href=\"https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-cat-glare-745763242.jpg\">glare</a> again dominated the sky.",
