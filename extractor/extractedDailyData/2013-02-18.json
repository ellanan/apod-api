  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat in heaven's blazes is that?\n\nThousands of people living near the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains\">Ural Mountains</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\">Russia</a> saw last Friday morning one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/russian-meteor-largest-in-a-century-1.12438\">more spectacular meteors of modern times</a> streak across the sky.\n\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=30724&amp;start=25#p193059\">Forceful sound waves</a> \narrived at the ground minutes later, knocking people over and breaking windows for hundreds of kilometers.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Omh7_I8vI\">above video</a> is a compilation of several \ncar dashcams and includes real time footage of the meteor rampaging, \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX6QsFeqers\">smoke trails drifting</a>, \nshadows quickly shifting, and even the meteor's light reflecting off the back of a bus. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap110123.html\">fireball</a> is thought to have been caused by a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_Meteorite\">car-sized chunk</a> \nof ice and \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2013/02142336-breaking-meteor-fall-causes.html\">rock crashing</a> into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nSince the event was captured from so many angles, the \n<a href=\"http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/Watch%20the%20Skies/posts/post_1360985685055.html\">meteor's trajectory</a> has become determined well enough to indicate from where it came \nand to where any resultant pieces might have landed.\n\nIt is already certain that this meteor had nothing to do with the several-times larger \n<a href=\"ap130217.html\">asteroid 2012 DA14</a> which passed the \nEarth from a different direction later the same day. \n\nIf <a href=\"ap090328.html\">pieces of the meteor</a> are found,\nthey might tell \n<a href=\"http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/files/2009/09/3d-glasses-life.jpg\">humanity</a> more about the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system_formation\">early Solar System</a>, \nwhen the meteor was likely formed.",
