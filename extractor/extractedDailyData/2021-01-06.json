  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are these sand dunes on \n<a ref=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> striped? \n\nNo one is sure. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_066476_2370\">featured image</a> shows striped dunes in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunowsky_(Martian_crater)\">Kunowsky Crater</a> on Mars, photographed recently with the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s</a> HiRISE Camera. \n\nMany Martian dunes are known to be covered unevenly with carbon dioxide \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_ice\">dry ice</a>) frost, \ncreating patterns of light and dark areas. \n\nCarbon dioxide doesn’t melt, but \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)\">sublimates</a>, turning directly into a gas.\n\nCarbon dioxide is also a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas\">greenhouse material</a> even as a solid, \nso it can trap heat under the ice and \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/L_gnxWUuLm0\">sublimate</a> from the bottom up, causing \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geysers_on_Mars\">geyser-like eruptions</a>. \n\nDuring Martian spring, these eruptions can cause a pattern of dark \n<a href=\"ap070805.html\">defrosting spots</a>, where the \n<a href=\"ap160119.html\">darker sand</a> is exposed. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/186557130@N06/50642211592/in/pool-apods/\">featured image</a>, though, was taken during Martian autumn, \nwhen the weather is getting colder – making these stripes particularly puzzling. \n\nOne hypothesis is that they are caused by cracks in the ice that form from weaker eruptions or \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_stress\">thermal stress</a> as part of the day-night cycle, but research continues. \n\nWatching these dunes and others through more \n<a href=\"https://www.msss.com/http/ps/seasons/seasons.html\">Martian seasons</a> \nmay give us more clues to solve this mystery.",
