  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nIn time stars trace lines through the night sky\n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/\">on a rotating planet</a>.\n\nTaken over two hours or more, these digitally added consecutive exposures\nwere made with a camera and wide angle lens fixed to a tripod\nnear Orel farm, Primorsky Krai, Russia, planet Earth.\n\nThe stars trail in concentric arcs around the planet's\n<a href=\"ap120802.html\">south celestial pole</a>\nbelow the scene's horizon, and north celestial pole off\nthe frame at the upper right.\n\nCombined, the many short exposures also bring out the pretty star\ncolours.\n\nBluish trails are from stars hotter than Earth's Sun,\nwhile yellowish trails are from cooler stars.\n\nA long time ago this tree\n<a href=\"ap150506.html\">blossomed</a>, but now\nreveals the passage of time in the wrinkled and weathered lines\nof its remains.",
