  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would the sky still glow after sunset?\n\nBesides stars and the band of our Milky Way galaxy, \nthe sky might glow because it contains either noctilucent clouds or aurora.\n\nRare individually, both are visible in the above time lapse movie taken over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caithness\">Caithness</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland\">Scotland</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom\">UK</a> \ntaken during a single night earlier this month.\n\nFirst noted in 1885, many \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohQzHz9gy6c\">noctilucent clouds</a> \nare known to correlate with atmospheric meteor trails, although details and \nthe origins of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_clouds\">others</a> remain a topic of research. \n\nThese meandering bright filaments of sunlight-reflecting ice crystals are the \n<a href=\"http://aim.hamptonu.edu/\">highest clouds</a> in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7PQbfnErEw\">above video</a> captures not only a variety of \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/nlc1.htm\">noctilucent clouds</a>, \nbut also how their structure varies over minutes.\n\nLower clouds typically appear dark or fast moving.\n\nAbout halfway through the video the clouds are joined by \n<a href=\"http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast\">aurora</a>.\n\nAt times, low clouds, \n<a href=\"ap120822.html\">noctilucent clouds</a>, and aurora are all visible simultaneously, \neach doing their own separate dance, and once -- see if you can \n<a href=\"http://www.mikescottandassociates.co.uk/assets/Cat.jpg\">find it</a> -- even with the \n<a href=\"ap130421.html\">Big Dipper</a> rotating across the background.",
