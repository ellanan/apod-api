  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen an aurora?  \n\nAuroras are occurring again with increasing frequency.\n\nWith the Sun being \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/01apr_deepsolarminimum/\">unusually dormant</a> over the past four years, the amount of Sun-induced auroras has been unusually low.\n\nMore <a href=\"ap100806.html\">recently</a>, however, \nour Sun has become increasingly active and \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/79389/breathtaking-recent-aurora-images-from-earth-and-space/\">exhibiting</a> a greater abundance of \n<a href=\"ap051106.html\">sunspots</a>, \n<a href=\"ap031029.html\">flares</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">coronal mass ejections</a>.\n\nSolar activity \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/aurora/gallery_01jan12.htm\">like this</a> \ntypically expels charged particles into the Solar System, some of which may trigger \n<a href=\"http://odin.gi.alaska.edu/FAQ/\">Earthly auroras</a>.\n\nTwo weeks ago, beyond trees and before stars, a solar storm precipitated the \n<a href=\" http://vimeo.com/36141149\">above timelapse displays</a> \nof picturesque auroras above Ravnastua, Skoganvarre and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakselv\">Lakselv</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap050807.html\">Curtains</a> of auroral light, typically green, \n<a href=\"ap101124.html\">flow</a>, \n<a href=\"ap100917.html\">shimmer</a> and \n<a href=\"ap100725.html\">dance</a> as \nenergetic particles fall toward the Earth and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state\">excite</a> \nair molecules high up in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWith <a href=\"ap071203.html\">solar maximum</a> still in the future, there may be even better opportunities to see spectacular \n<a href=\"http://www.ips.gov.au/Solar/1/3\">auroras</a> personally over the next few years.",
