  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nLike the downtown area of your favorite city,\nthe roads you drive to work on, and any\n<a href=\"http://www.phy.mtu.edu/apod/calendar/allyears.html\">self-respecting Web site</a> ...\nIo's surface is constantly <i>under construction</i>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/io/fact.html#summary\">This moon of Jupiter</a> holds the\n<a href=\"ap961129.html\">distinction</a> of being\nthe Solar System's most volcanically active body --\nits bizarre looking surface\n<a href=\"ap961231.html\">continuously</a>\nformed and reformed by lava flows.\n\nGenerated using 1996 data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft,\n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/callisto/PIA00583.html\">this highest resolution composite image of Io</a>\nis centered on the side of Io that always faces away from Jupiter.\n\nIt has been enhanced to emphasize Io's surface brightness\nand color variations,\nrevealing features as small as 1.5 miles across.\n\nThe notable absence of\n<a href=\"ap960906.html\">impact craters</a>\nsuggests that the entire\nsurface is covered with new volcanic deposits much more rapidly\nthan craters are created.\n\n<a href=\"ap960815.html\">What drives this volcanic powerhouse?</a>\n\nA likely energy source is the changing gravitational\ntides caused by Jupiter and the other\nGalilean moons as Io orbits the massive gas giant planet.\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/status960503.html\">Heating Io's interior</a>, the pumping tides could generate\nthe sulfurous\n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/\">volcanic activity</a>.",
