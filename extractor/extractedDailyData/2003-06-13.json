  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn the 1960s spring came to the southern hemisphere of\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html\">Neptune,</a>\nthe Solar System's outermost gas giant planet.\n\nOf course, since Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165\n<a href=\"http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit4/ApparentMotion/\nbody_apparentmotion.html\">earth-years</a>,\nit's still springtime for southern Neptune, where\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast22sep_1.htm\">each\nseason</a> lasts over four decades.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/media/Neptune2003.htm\">Astronomers\nhave found</a> that in recent years\nNeptune has been\n<a href=\"http://www.news.wisc.edu/view.html?get=8676\">getting\nbrighter</a>, as illustrated in\nthis Hubble Space Telescope image made in 2002.\n\nCompared\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/17/\">to Hubble\npictures</a> taken as early as 1996,\nthe 2002 image shows a dramatic increase in reflective\nwhite cloud bands in Neptune's southern hemisphere.\n\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\nneptunefact.html\">Neptune's</a>\nequator is tilted 29 degrees from the plane of its orbit,\nabout the same as Earth's 23.5 degree tilt, and\n<a href=\"ap020922.html\">Neptune's weather</a>\nseems to be dramatically responding to the\nsimilar relative seasonal increase in sunlight -- even though\nsunlight is 900 times\nless intense for the distant gas giant than for planet Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, summer is really just around the\ncorner, coming to\n<a href=\"ap990710.html\">Neptune's southern</a> hemisphere in 2005.",
