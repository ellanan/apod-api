  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.westegg.com/einstein/\">Albert Einstein</a>\n(1879-1955) is considered by many the greatest astrophysicist and\nsingle most significant\n<a href=\"http://www.pathfinder.com/time/\ntime100/poc/home.html\">Person of the 20th Century</a>.\n\nHe is pictured here in the Swiss Patent Office where \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/\">he</a> did much of his defining work.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/\nEinstein.html\">Einstein</a>'s many visionary scientific contributions\ninclude the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc^2),\nhow the maximum speed limit of light affects measurements of time and space \n(<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/\nSpecial_relativity.html\">special relativity</a>), and a more accurate\ntheory of gravity based on simple geometric concepts \n(<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/\nGeneral_relativity.html\">general relativity</a>).\n\nOne reason\n<a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/\neinstein.html\">Einstein</a> was awarded the 1921\n<a href=\"http://www.nobel.se/enm-index.html\">Nobel Prize</a> in Physics was to make the prize more prestigious.",
