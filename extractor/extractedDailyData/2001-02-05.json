  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy isn't this ant a big sphere?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">Planetary nebula</a> Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a> that is, surely, round.  \n\nWhy then would the gas that is streaming away create an \n<a href=\"http://www.discovery.com/cams/ant/learn.html\">ant</a>-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  \n\n<a href=\"http://hubble.esa.int/hubble/news/\nindex.cfm?oid=25994\">Clues might include</a>\nthe high 1000-kilometer per second \nspeed of the expelled gas, the \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/\nquestions/question19.html\">light-year</a> long length of the structure, and the \n<a href=\"http://www.wondermagnet.com/dev/magfaq.html\">magnetism</a> of the star \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2001feb/display.html\">visible above</a> at the nebula's center.  \n\nOne possible answer is that \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2001feb/table.html\">Mz3</a> is hiding a second, dimmer star that \n<a href=\"ap991219.html\">orbits close</a> in to the bright star.  \n\nA competing hypothesis holds that the central star's own spin and \n<a href=\"ap980629.html\">magnetic field</a> are channeling the gas.  \n\nSince the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, \n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/%7Eeducation/career.html\">astronomers</a> hope that increased understanding of the history of \nthis giant space \n<a href=\"http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2064.html\">ant</a> can provide useful insight into the likely \nfuture of our own \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> and \n<a href=\"earth.html\">Earth</a>.",
