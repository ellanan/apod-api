  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's a good recipe for preparing Martian soil?\n\nStart by filling your robot's scoop a bit less than half way.  \n\nNext, dump your Martian soil into one of your \n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science_tega.php\">TEGA</a> \novens, being sure to \n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/06_08_pr.php\">watch out for clumping</a>.  \n\nThen, slowly increase the temperature to over 1000 degrees \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius\">Celsius</a> over several days.  \n\nKeep checking to see when your soil becomes \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCtdW_BDuVI\">vaporized</a>.  \n\nFinally, your <a href=\"ap071218.html\">Martian soil</a> is not ready for eating, but rather \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometer\">sniffing</a>\n\nThe above technique is being used by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html\">Phoenix Lander</a> that \n<a href=\"ap080525.html\">arrived</a> on Mars \n<a href=\"ap080527.html\">three weeks ago</a>.  \n\nData from the first batch of baked soil should be available in a few days.\n\n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/images.php?gID=4865&amp;cID=69\">Pictured above</a>, a circular array of the Phoenix Lander's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel\">solar panels</a> \nare visible on the left, while a scoop partly filled with Martian soil is visible on the right.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/pdf/fact_sheet.pdf\">robotic Phoenix Lander</a> \nwill spend much of the next three months digging, scooping, baking, sniffing, zapping, dissolving, and magnifying bits of Mars to help neighboring \n<a href=\"ap061001.html\">Earthl</a>ings learn more about the \nhydrologic and biologic possibilities of the \n<a href=\"ap010331.html\">sometimes mysterious</a> red planet.",
