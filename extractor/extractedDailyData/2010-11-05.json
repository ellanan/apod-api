  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFollow these 5 frames clockwise starting from the top left to track\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/images/\nsunshine1.html\">the view from</a> the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/index.html\">EPOXI\nmission</a> spacecraft as it approached, passed under,\nand then looked back at the nucleus of\n<a href=\"ap101026.html\">comet Hartley 2</a> on November 4.\n\nIts closest approach distance was about 700 kilometers.\n\nIn fact, this encounter was\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13576\">the\nfifth time</a> a spacecraft from\nplanet Earth has imaged a comet close-up.\n\nBut Hartley 2's nucleus is definitely the smallest one so far, its\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/images/\nsunshine-3.html\">long axis spanning</a>\nonly about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).\n\nThough Hartley 2 is small, these stunning images showing jets of dust\nand gas indicate an impressively active surface.\n\nThe jets are seen originating from the rough surface areas, with\nsunlight illuminating the nucleus from the right.\n\nRemarkably, rough areas at both ends of the elongated nucleus are joined\nby a narrower, smooth waist.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/\nepoxi20101025.html\">The EPOXI mission</a>\nreuses the Deep Impact spacecraft that launched a probe impacting the\n<a href=\"ap050915.html\">nucleus of comet Tempel 1</a> in 2005.",
