  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nStar light, star bright, a new brightest star has been discovered in the night.  \nThis \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/33.html\">new brightest star</a> is so far away and so obscured by \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a>, however, that it took the \n<a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> to confirm it.   \nIn 1990 a star named the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~figer/intro.html\">Pistol Star</a> \nwas known to lie at the center of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~figer/6cmpist.html\">Pistol Nebula</a>.  \nIn 1995 it was suggested that the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995ApJ%2E%2E%2E447L%2E%2E29F&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Pistol Star</a> was so massive it was throwing off the \nmass that actually <i>created</i> the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E474%2E%2E275L&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Pistol Nebula</a>.  Now, observations from the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/33/PR.html\">released today</a> confirm the spectral relation \nbetween the star and the nebula.  \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/captions/97-33.txt\">Dramatic implications</a> include that the star emits \n10 million times more light than our \n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>, and is about \n100 times more massive.   Astronomers are currently unsure how a star this \nmassive could have formed and how it will act in the future.",
