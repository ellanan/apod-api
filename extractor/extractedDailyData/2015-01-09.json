  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSpiral galaxy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1097\">NGC 1097</a>\nshines in southern skies, about\n45 million light-years away in the chemical constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/for/index.html\">Fornax</a>.\n\nIts blue spiral arms are mottled with pinkish star forming regions in\n<a href=\"http://www.starshadows.com/gallery/display.cfm?imgID=505\">this\ncolorful galaxy portrait</a>.\n\nThey seem to have wrapped around a small companion galaxy below\nand left of center, about 40,000 light-years from the spiral's luminous\ncore.\n\nThat's not NGC 1097's only peculiar feature, though.\n\nThe very deep exposure hints of faint,\nmysterious jets, most easily seen to extend well beyond\nthe bluish arms toward the left.\n\nIn fact, four faint jets are ultimately\n<a href=\"image/0911/NGC1097invert_gendlerJets.jpg\">recognized</a>\nin optical images of NGC 1097.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...585..281H\">The jets\ntrace an X</a> centered on the galaxy's nucleus, but probably don't\noriginate there.\n\nInstead, they could be <a href=\"ap080619.html\">fossil star streams</a>,\ntrails <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1353\">left over</a> from the\ncapture and disruption of a much smaller galaxy in the\nlarge spiral's ancient past.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyfert_galaxy\">A Seyfert\ngalaxy</a>, NGC 1097's nucleus also harbors a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/\nngc1097.html\">supermassive black hole</a>.",
