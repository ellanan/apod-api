  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's the farthest galaxy known?  The answer \n<a href=\"ap970731.html\">keeps changing</a> as astronomers \ncompete to find new galaxies which top the list.  \nThe new record holder is now the faint red \nsmudge indicated in the <a href=\"http://www.jhu.edu/news_info/news/home98/mar98/stellar.html\">above image</a> by the arrow.  \n\nDetected light left this galaxy <a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletters/lpib/lpib77/black77.html\">billions of years ago</a>, \nwell before the Earth formed, \nwhen the universe was younger than 1/10th of its present age.  \n\nAstronomers have measured a\n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#redshift\">redshift</a> of \n5.34 for this galaxy, breaking the \n\"5 barrier\" for the first time.  \n\nYoung galaxies are of much interest \nto astronomers because many unanswered questions \nexist on when and <a href=\"http://phobos.astro.uwo.ca/~thacker/cosmology/CASCA.html\">how galaxies formed</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap960907.html\">early universe</a>.  \n\nAlthough this galaxy's distance exceeds \nthat of even the farthest known \n<a href=\"ap971206.html\">quasar</a>, \nit is still in front of the pervasive glowing \ngas that is now seen as the \n<a href=\"ap970309.html\">cosmic microwave \nbackground radiation</a>.",
