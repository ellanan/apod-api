  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSomething strange happened to this galaxy, but what?\n\nKnown as the \n<a href=\"ap230802.html\">Cigar Galaxy</a> and cataloged as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82\">M82</a>, \nred glowing gas and dust are being cast out from the center. \n\nAlthough this \n<a href=\"http://burro.case.edu/Academics/Astr222/Galaxies/Peculiar/starburst.html\">starburst galaxy</a> was surely stirred up by a recent pass near its \n<a href=\"ap160203.html\">neighbor</a>, \nlarge spiral galaxy <a href=\"ap210312.html\">M81</a>, \nthis doesn't fully explain the source of the \nred-glowing outwardly expanding gas and \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">dust</a>. \n\nEvidence indicates that this material is being driven out by the combined emerging \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\">particle winds</a> \nof many stars, together creating a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_superwind\">galactic superwind</a>.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/109/01HRD12PNCS1RFCS4VAHWPZDGQ\">featured images</a>, a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> image in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/\">visible light</a> \nis shown on the left, while a \n<a href=\"https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> image of the central region in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/\">infrared light</a> \nis shown on the right. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.ardeaprints.com/p/172/cat-black-white-cat-garden-looking-plant-3749006.jpg.webp\">Detailed inspection</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-109\">new Webb image</a> shows, unexpectedly, \nthat this red-glowing dust is associated with \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3vtGktz8c1M\">hot plasma</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240116648B/abstract\">Research</a> into the nature of \n<a href=\"ap230802.html\">this strange nearby galaxy</a> will surely continue.",
