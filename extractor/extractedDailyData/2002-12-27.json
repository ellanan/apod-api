  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA mere 6,000 light-years distant and sailing through the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vel/index.html\">Vela</a>,\nstar cluster <a href=\"ap020717.html\">RCW 38</a>\nis full of powerful stars.\n\nIt's no surprise that these stars,\nonly a million years young with hot outer atmospheres,\n<a href=\"ap990828.html\">appear as</a>\npoint-like x-ray sources dotting\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2002/rcw38/index.html\">this\nx-ray image</a> from the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra\nObservatory</a>. \n\nBut the diffuse cloud of x-rays surrounding them is a bit\nmysterious.\n\nThe image is color coded by x-ray energy, with high energies\nin blue, medium in green, and low energy x-rays in red.\n\nJust a few light-years across, the cloud\nwhich pervades the cluster has colors suggesting\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/\nhistory_xray.html\">the x-rays</a>\nare produced by high energy electrons\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/xrays3.html\">moving\nthrough magnetic fields</a>.\n\nYet a source of energetic electrons, such as shockwaves\nfrom exploding stars (<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nsupernovas.html\">supernova remnants</a>),\nor rotating neutron stars\n(pulsars), is not apparent in the Chandra data.\n\nWhatever their origins, the energetic particles could leave an imprint on\nplanetary systems forming in young star cluster RCW 38, just\nas nearby <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/gamma/\nmilkyway.html\">energetic</a>\nevents seem to have affected the chemistry and\nisotopes found <a href=\"http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Mar00/\nsupernovaDebris.html\">in our own solar system</a>.",
