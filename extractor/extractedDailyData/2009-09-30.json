  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow would Saturn look if its ring plane pointed right at the Sun?\n\nBefore last month, nobody knew.  \n\nEvery 15 years, as seen from Earth,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">Saturn's rings</a>\npoint toward the Earth and\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/us/saturn-s-rings-are-still-a-very-strange-wonder-and-a-source-of-surprises.html\">appear to disappear</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap090904.html\">disappearing rings</a> are no longer a mystery -- Saturn's rings are known to be\n<a href=\"ap051219.html\">so thin</a> and the\n<a href=\"ap090111.html\">Earth is so near the Sun</a>\nthat when the rings point toward the Sun, they also point\n<a href=\"ap090428.html\">nearly edge-on</a> at the Earth.\n\nFortunately, in this\n<a href=\"ap010101.html\">third millennium</a>, humanity is advanced enough to have a spacecraft that can see the rings\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002044/\">during equinox</a>\nfrom the side.\n\nLast month, that Saturn-orbiting spacecraft,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini�Huygens\">Cassini</a>,\nwas able to snap a series of unprecedented pictures of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1_SgVFpjBU\">Saturn's rings during equinox</a>.\n\nA digital composite of 75 such images is\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11667\">shown above</a>.\n\nThe rings appear <a href=\"ap090901.html\">unusually dark</a>, and a very thin ring shadow line can be made out on Saturn's cloud-tops.  \n\nObjects sticking out of the ring plane are\n<a href=\"ap090825.html\">brightly illuminated</a> and cast\n<a href=\"ap090415.html\">long shadows</a>.  \n\nInspection of these images may help\nhumanity understand the specific\n<a href=\"ap050525.html\">sizes of Saturn's ring particles</a> and the\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Icar..166..320G\">general dynamics</a>\nof <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfDDI_SCarw\">orbital motion</a>.",
