  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was once a beach -- on ancient \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/\">Mars</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11241\">featured 360-degree panorama</a>, \n<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/62/f1/fe/62f1fe59e5e8ed26d724f701adc5be0b.jpg\">horizontally compressed</a>, was taken in 2017 by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/rover/\">Curiosity rover</a> \nthat explored the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/goddard/nasa-new-study-on-why-mars-is-red-supports-potentially-habitable-past/\">red planet</a>.\n\nNamed Ogunquit Beach after its \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NUOfTyFumg\">terrestrial counterpart</a>, \nevidence shows that at times long ago the area was underwater, \nwhile at other times it was at the edge of an \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-rover-team-confirms-ancient-lakes-on-mars/\">ancient lake</a>. \n\nThe light peak in the central background is the top of \n<a href=\"ap120827.html\">Mount Sharp</a>, the central feature in \n<a href=\"ap110729.html\">Gale Crater</a> where Curiosity explored.\n\nPortions of the \n<a href=\"ap160119.html\">dark sands</a> in the foreground were  \n<a href=\"http://redplanet.asu.edu/?p=23396\">scooped up</a> for analysis. \n\nThe light colored \n<a href=\"ap040127.html\">bedrock</a> is composed of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment\">sediment</a> \nthat likely settled at the bottom of the now-dried lakebed. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11241\">featured</a> panorama \n(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/V3qr9AqZyEI\">interactive version here</a>)\nwas created from over 100 images and seemingly signed by the rover on the lower left.",
