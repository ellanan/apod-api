  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan you find the Moon?\n\nThis usually simple task can be quite difficult. \n\nEven though the Moon is above your horizon half of the time, its \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/en/\">phase</a> can be \nanything from crescent to full.\n\nThe featured image was taken in late May from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/SaCuz9HwYfo\">Sant Martí d'Empúries</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, over the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a> in the early morning.\n\nOne reason \n<a href=\"https://i.imgflip.com/11a4ul.jpg\">you can't find</a> \nthis moon is because it is very near to its \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon\">new phase</a>, \nwhen very little of the half illuminated by \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> is visible to the Earth.\n\nAnother reason is because this moon is \n<a href=\"ap210711.html\">near the horizon</a> \nand so seen through a long path of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> -- a path which \n<a href=\"https://opg.optica.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-3-10-1135&amp;id=13535\">dims</a> the already faint crescent.\n\nAny <a href=\"ap210725.html\">crescent moon</a> is \nonly visible near the direction the Sun, \nand so only locatable near sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe Moon \n<a href=\"ap220201.html\">runs through all</a> of its \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/676/phases-of-the-moon/\">phases</a> in a month \n(<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/month\">moon-th</a>), \nand this month the thinnest \n<a href=\"ap210429.html\">sliver of a crescent</a> -- a new moon -- \nwill occur in three days.",
