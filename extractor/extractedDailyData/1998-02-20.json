  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhere is Hale-Bopp now?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/\">The Great Comet of 1997</a>,\none of the largest and most active comets ever,\nis <a href=\"ap970910.html\">outbound</a> about 400 million miles from the sun.\n\nToo faint for viewing without telescopes or binoculars, Hale-Bopp\nis presently positioned\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/hale_bopp/hb298.gif\">in the very southerly constellation of Pictor</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/phot-05-98.html\">This \"negative\" image</a> (black stars against white sky) of Hale-Bopp\nis the result of a 1 hour time exposure using the 1-metre\n<a href=\"http://search.eso.org:8080/lasilla/generalinfo/html/aboutls.html\">European Southern Observatory</a> Schmidt telescope on January 5.\n\nClearly the comet still has\n<a href=\"ap971215.html\">a substantial tail</a>, blown by\n<a href=\"ap970217.html\">the solar wind</a>,\nthat points generally away from the sunward direction.\n\nBut look closely.\n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06800/06812.html\">A spiky \"anti-tail\" is also visible</a> pointing toward the sun!\n\nIt is likely that this anti-tail is composed of dust grains released\nfrom <a href=\"ap961210.html\">the comet nucleus</a>\nwhich are too large to be easily pushed by the solar wind.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~weaver/hb_stis.html\">As Hale-Bopp recedes</a>\nfrom the sun its activity will subside but astronomers\nare still uncertain as to how long its tails will last.\n\nAfter a swing through the outer solar system and\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/comets/Oort_cloud.html\">the Oort cloud</a>,\nHale-Bopp will pass through the inner solar system again ...\naround the year 5400.",
