  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTwo impressive comets will both reach their peak brightness during the next two weeks.\n\nTaking advantage of a rare imaging opportunity, \nboth of these comets were captured in the sky together last week over the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert\">Atacama desert</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America\">South America</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap130207.html\">Comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)</a>, visible on the upper left of the above image, is sporting a long tail dominated by glowing green ions. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/Update-on-Comet-PanSTARRS-187930541.html\">Comet C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS)</a>, visible near the horizon on the lower right, is showing a bright tail dominated by dust reflecting sunlight.\n\nThe tails of <a href=\"ap040503.html\">both comets</a> point approximately toward the recently set Sun. \n\n<a href=\"http://mpcapp1.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK12F060\">Comet Lemmon</a> will be just barely visible to the unaided eye before sunset in southern skies for the next week, and then \n<a href=\"http://cometchasing.skyhound.com/comets/2012_F6.pdf\">best viewed</a> \nwith binoculars as it fades and moves slowly north.\n\n<a href=\"http://mpcapp1.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK11L040\">Comet PanSTARRS</a>, however, will remain visible in southern skies for only a few more days, \nafter which it will remain bright enough to be \n<a href=\"http://cometchasing.skyhound.com/comets/2011_L4.pdf\">locatable</a> with the unaided eye as it moves into northern skies.\n\nTo find the giant melting snowball PanSTARRS, sky enthusiasts should \n<a href=\"http://cometchasing.skyhound.com/\">look toward</a> the western horizon just after sunset.\n\nDeep sky observers are also \n<a href=\"http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/CometMags.html\">monitoring the brightening</a> of \n<a href=\"ap121001.html\">Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON)</a><a>, \nwhich may become one of the brightest objects in the entire night sky toward the end of 2013.\n\n\n</a>",
