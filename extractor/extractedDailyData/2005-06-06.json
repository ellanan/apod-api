  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nEating surface ice from Enceladus might be healthier \nthan eating ice from Saturn's rings -- it certainly appears cleaner.  \n\nFrom their apparent <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1994Icar..109..241D\">densities</a> and reflectance properties, both the \n<a href=\"http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html\">rings of Saturn</a> and its shiniest moon, \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/enceladus.html\">Enceladus</a>, \nare thought to be composed predominantly of \n<a href=\"http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/FAQ.htm\">water ice</a>.  \n\nFor reasons that are not yet understood, however, many of \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html\">Saturn's ring particles</a> have become partly coated with some \nsort of relatively dark dust, while the surface of \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Enceladus\">Enceladus</a> appears comparatively bright and clean.  \n\nThe contrast between the two can be seen in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06653\">above image</a> taken last month by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/index.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now in \n<a href=\"http://www.bridgewater.edu/departments/physics/ISAW/PlanetOrbit.html\">orbit</a> around \n<a href=\"saturn.html\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nBright <a href=\"ap050224.html\">Enceladus</a> shines \nin the background in contrast to the darker foreground rings.  \n\nThe reason why <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28mythology%29\">Enceladus</a> is so bright is currently \nunknown but might involve bringing fresh water to its surface with \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996Icar..119..385K\">water volcanoes</a>.",
