  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow old are Saturn's rings?  \n\nNo one is quite sure. \n\nOne possibility is that the rings formed relatively recently in our\nSolar System's history, perhaps only about 100 million years ago when\na moon-sized object \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit\">broke up</a> near Saturn.  \n\nEvidence for a young ring age includes a basic \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133..656V\">stability\nanalysis for rings</a>, \nand the fact that the rings are so bright and\nrelatively unaffected by numerous small dark \n<a href=\"ap011118.html\">meteor</a> impacts.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-149\">More recent \nevidence</a>, however, raises the possibility that some of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings\">Saturn's rings</a> \nmay be billions of years old and so almost as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment\">old</a> as Saturn itself.   \n\nInspection of images by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft\nindicates that some of \n<a href=\"ap040723.html\">Saturn's ring</a> particles temporarily\nbunch and collide, effectively recycling \n<a href=\"ap071024.html\">ring</a> particles by bringing\nfresh bright ices to the surface.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09788\">Seen here</a>, \nSaturn's rings were imaged in their true colors by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens\">robotic\nCassini</a> in late October.  \n\nIcy bright <a href=\"ap070909.html\">Tethys</a>, \na moon of Saturn likely brightened by a sandblasting \n<a href=\"ap071013.html\">rain of ice</a> from sister moon \n<a href=\"ap060310.html\">Enceladus</a>, is visible in front of\nthe darker rings.",
