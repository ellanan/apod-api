  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is Phobos so dark?  \n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/phobos/in-depth/\">Phobos</a>, the largest and innermost of the two\nMartian moons, is the darkest moon in the entire \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nIts unusual orbit and color indicate that it may be a captured \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/overview/\">asteroid</a> composed of a mixture of ice and dark rock.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53063793187/in/pool-apods/\">featured assigned-color picture</a> \nof Phobos near the edge of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> \nwas captured in late 2021 by \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int\">ESA</a>'s robot spacecraft \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express\">Mars Express</a>, currently orbiting Mars.  \n\n<a href=\"ap080414.html\">Phobos</a> is a heavily cratered and \n<a href=\"ap031109.html\">barren</a> moon, with its \n<a href=\"ap230708.html\">largest crater</a> located on the far side.  \n\nFrom images like this, \n<a href=\"ap061203.html\">Phobos</a> has been determined \nto be covered by perhaps a meter of \n<a href=\"ap980914.html\">loose dust</a>.  \n\nPhobos <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rxqZcO-0uI\">orbits</a> \nso close to Mars that from some places it would appear to rise and \nset twice a day, while from other places it would \n<a href=\"https://img.jagranjosh.com/images/2023/June/2062023/find-the-cat-in-leaves.jpg\">not be visible</a> at all.  \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)\">Phobos</a>' orbit around Mars is \ncontinually decaying -- it will likely \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.P51C1423H/abstract\">break up</a> with pieces crashing to the Martian surface in about 50 million years.",
