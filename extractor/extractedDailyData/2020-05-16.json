  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA dark river seems to flow through this sky from the horizon toward\n<a href=\"ap160705.html\">colorful clouds</a> near red giant star Antares.\n\nMurky looking, the dark river is a dusty\nnebula obscuring background starlight near the central Milky Way,\nalthough the dark dust nebula contains mostly hydrogen molecular gas.  \n\nDust scattering starlight around\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/antares.html\">Antares</a>,\nalpha star of Scorpius, creates the unusual yellow-hued\nreflection nebula.\n\nAbove it, bright blue double star\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_Ophiuchi\">Rho Ophiuchi</a> is\nembedded in more typical dusty bluish reflection nebulae, with\nred emission nebulae also scattered through the interstellar space.\n\nGlobular star cluster M4 looks almost like a bright star\njust above and right of Antares, \nthough it lies far behind the colorful clouds, at a distance of some\n7,000 light-years.\n\nThe dark river itself is about 500 light years away. \n\nTo create the startling night sky view, all background and foreground\n<a href=\"image/2005/Reflections_source_images.gif\">exposures were made back to back</a>\nwith the same camera and telephoto lens on the same night from the same\nlocation.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/nightscaper/permalink/2399869776990601/\">In combination they produce</a>\na stunning image that reveals\na range of brightness and color that your eye can't quite\n<a href=\"ap130411.html\">perceive</a>.\n\nRecorded in the early hours of January 31,\nthe composite also captures Mars still near the eastern horizon and\nrising to join rival Antares on\n<a href=\"https://www.paulschmitphotography.com/How-To-Guides/Capturing-Galaxyset\">the celestial stage</a>.\n\nBright Mars and its watery reflection are left of a lonely tree in the\nBosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico,\n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/earth-now/#/\">planet Earth</a>.",
