  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe dramatic rotation of the cloud-tops of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> every ten-hours is particularly \nevident from orbit around the gas giant planet.  \n\nWith a good enough telescope, however, such rotation \nis visible even from Earth, as shown by \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/anim1.html\">this time-lapse image sequence</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \ntaken in November 1990.  \n\nParticularly evident at that time was a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999Icar..137...24A\">light-colored giant storm cloud system</a> that\n completely encircled the planet.  \n\nThe storm was not evident twenty years ago \nduring the flybys of the \n<a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html\">Voyager spacecraft</a> -- a storm of this \nmagnitude was last noted in 1933.  \n\nStudying the \n<a href=\"ap000926.html\">complex atmosphere</a> \nof Saturn will be one objective of the \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/\">Cassini</a> spacecraft \n<a href=\"ap971016.html\">launched</a> by NASA in \n1997 and expected to arrive in 2004.",
