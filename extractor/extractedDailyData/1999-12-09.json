  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe Q-shaped cloud seen in\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/snrg/index.html\">this false-color X-ray image</a>\nfrom the orbiting Chandra Observatory is big ... about\n40 <i>light-years</i> across.\n\nIt's hot too, as its\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/discover.html\">X-ray glow</a> is produced by multi-million\ndegree gas.\n\nCataloged as E0102-72, this cosmic Q is likely a\nseveral thousand year old\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a>, the\nresult of the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nA supernova can dramatically affect its galactic\nenvironment, triggering <a href=\"ap991130.html\" <a=\"\">star formation</a>\nand <a href=\"ap960509.html\">enriching</a>\nthe local interstellar medium with newly\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9910474\">synthesized elements</a>.\n\nThis supernova remnant is\nlocated about 210,000 light-years away in our neighboring galaxy, the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/smc.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)</a>, so the detailed Chandra\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/xrays.html\">X-ray</a> image\nis impressive - particularly as it reveals\nwhat appear to be strange spoke-like\nstructures radiating from the remnant's center.",
