  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ret6VBuCp30\">What can you see</a> in the night sky this season? \n\nThe featured graphic gives a few highlights for \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/\">Earth</a>'s northern hemisphere.\n\nViewed as a clock face centered at the bottom, early (northern) spring sky events fan out toward the left, while late spring events are projected toward the right.\n\nObjects relatively close to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth\">Earth</a> \nare illustrated, in general, as nearer to the cartoon figure with the telescope at the bottom center -- although almost \n<a href=\"https://www.astroshop.eu/blog/?p=39945\">everything pictured</a> \ncan be <a href=\"https://www.lifewithdogs.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/577551_327739037281992_306958052693424_814778_1284589992_n.jpg\">seen without a telescope</a>. \n\nAs happens during any season, <a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/88constellations.html\">constellations</a> appear the same year to year, and, as usual, the \n<a href=\"ap170427.html\">Lyrids meteor shower</a> will peak in mid-April. \n\nAlso as usual, the \n<a href=\"ap161105.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) \n<a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\">can be seen, at times</a>, as a bright spot \n<a href=\"ap140525.html\">drifting across the sky</a> after sunset. \n\nAfter the \n<a href=\"ap180320.html\">Vernal Equinox</a> next week, the length of daytime will be greater than the length of nighttime in Earth's northern hemisphere, an inequality that will escalate as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)\">spring season</a> \ndevelops. \n\nAlso as spring ages, \n<a href=\"ap190304.html\">Jupiter</a> becomes visible increasingly earlier in the night.\n\nAs spring draws to a close, the month of May will feature \nthe third of four full moons of the season, one of the definiitions of a  \n<a href=\"ap040731.html\">Blue Moon</a>.",
