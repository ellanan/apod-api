  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening in the center of spiral NGC 5033?\n\nMany things -- some circular, some energetic, and some not well understood.\n\n<a href=\"ap120817.html\">NGC 5033</a> is known as a \n<a href=\"http://www.seyfertgalaxies.com/\">Seyfert galaxy</a> \nbecause of the great activity seen in its nucleus.\n\nBright \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a>, dark \n<a href=\"ap141214.html\">dust</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap130924.html\">interstellar gas</a> \nall swirl quickly around a \ngalactic center that appears slightly offset from a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole\">supermassive black hole</a>.\n\nThis offset is thought to be the result of \n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=9776\">NGC 5033</a> merging with another galaxy sometime in the past billion years. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/31777151491/\">featured image</a> \nwas taken by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 2005.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...433...79M\">NGC 5033</a> \nspans about 100,000 \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> and is so far away that we see it only as it existed about \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene\">40 million years ago</a>.",
