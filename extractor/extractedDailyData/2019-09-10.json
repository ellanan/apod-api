  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat color is Pluto, really?\n\nIt took some effort to figure out. \n\nEven given all of the \n<a href=\"ap150831.html\">images sent back</a> \nto Earth when the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons</a> spacecraft \n<a href=\"ap170731.html\">sped past Pluto</a> in 2015, \nprocessing these \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_(New_Horizons)\">multi-spectral</a> frames to approximate what the \n<a href=\"https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/humanvision/accommodation/index.html\">human eye</a> would see was challenging.\n\nThe result \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Galleries/Featured-Images/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=543\">featured here</a>, \nreleased three years after the raw data was acquired by \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft.php#Systems-and-Components\">New Horizons</a>, \nis the highest resolution true color image of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto/overview/\">Pluto</a> ever taken.\n\nVisible in the image is the light-colored, heart-shaped, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombaugh_Regio\">Tombaugh Regio</a>, with the unexpectedly smooth \n<a href=\"ap161122.html\">Sputnik Planitia</a>, \nmade of frozen \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml\">nitrogen</a>, \nfilling its western lobe.\n\nNew Horizons found the dwarf-planet to have a \n<a href=\"ap150914.html\">surprisingly complex surface</a> \ncomposed of many regions having perceptibly different hues. \n\nIn total, though, Pluto is \n<a href=\"ap060903.html\">mostly brown</a>, with much of its muted color originating from small amounts of surface methane energized by \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> from the Sun.",
