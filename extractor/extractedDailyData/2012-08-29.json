  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThere is something very unusual in this picture of the Earth -- can you find it?\n\nA fleeting phenomenon once thought to be only a legend has been newly caught if you know just where to look.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/seeing-sprites.html\">above image</a> \nwas taken from the orbiting \n<a href=\"ap110309.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) \nin late April and shows familiar ISS solar panels on the far left and part of a robotic arm to the far right.\n\nThe rarely imaged phenomenon is known as a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_sprite\">red sprite</a> and it \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/96984/on-the-hunt-for-high-speed-sprites/\">can be seen</a>, \nalbeit faintly, just over the bright area on the image right.\n\nThis bright area and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_J-rN_rhS0\">red sprite</a> \nare different types of lightning, \nwith the white flash the more typical type.\n\nAlthough <a href=\"ap990616.html\">sprites</a> have been reported \n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ok7KAaeDjoI/T9a_eWgdZNI/AAAAAAAAVUE/YBJJI1_DW0Q/s1600/Cat-whispering-to-dog.jpg\">anecdotally</a> for as long as 300 years, they were first caught on film in 1989 -- by accident.\n\nMuch remains unknown about \n<a href=\"ap951111.html\">sprites</a> including how they occur, their effect on the atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/lis/lis_4/\">global electric circuit</a>, \nand if they are somehow related to other \n<a href=\"http://www.sky-fire.tv/index.cgi/spritesbluejetselves.html\">upper atmospheric lightning</a> \nphenomena such as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning#Blue_jets\">blue jets</a> or \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_gamma-ray_flash\">terrestrial gamma flashes</a>.",
