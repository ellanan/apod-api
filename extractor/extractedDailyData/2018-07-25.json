  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat kind of celestial object is this?\n\nA relatively normal galaxy -- but seen from its edge. \n\nMany disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, \n<a href=\"https://www.adamblockphotos.com/ngc-5866.html\">pictured here</a>, but are not \n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">seen edge-on</a> from our vantage point.  \n\nA perhaps more familiar galaxy seen edge-on is our own \n<a href=\"ap100530.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nCataloged as M102 and NGC 5866, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866\">Spindle galaxy</a> \nhas numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, \nwhile many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue. \n\nThe blue disk of young \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> can be seen extending past the \n<a href=\"ap990919.html\">dust</a> in the extremely thin galactic plane.\n\nThere is evidence that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_(textiles)#/media/File:Drop_spindles.jpg\">Spindle</a> galaxy has cannibalized \nsmaller galaxies over the past billion years or so, including \n<a href=\"ap180206.html\">multiple streams</a> of faint stars, \ndark dust that extends away from the main galactic plane, and a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866_Group\">surrounding group</a> \nof galaxies (not shown). \n\nIn general, many <a href=\"ap120717.html\">disk galaxies become thin</a> because the gas that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution\">forms them</a> collides with itself as it rotates about the gravitational center.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap160309.html\">Spindle galaxy</a> \nlies about 50 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> distant toward the constellation of the Dragon\n(<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/draco.htm\">Draco</a>).",
