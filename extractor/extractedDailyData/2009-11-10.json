  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe other side of Saturn's ring plane is now directly illuminated by the Sun.\n\nFor the previous 15 years, the southern side of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>\nand its rings were directly illuminated, but since\n<a href=\"ap090901.html\">Saturn's equinox</a> in August,\nthe orientation has reversed.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12318\">Pictured above</a> last month, the robotic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini�Huygens\">Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn\nhas captured the giant planet and its\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UCCHjoQrM\">majestic rings</a> soon after equinox.\n\nImaged from nearly behind, Saturn and its moon\n<a href=\"ap041129.html\">Tethys</a> each show a crescent phase to\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturntourdates/\">Cassini</a> that is not visible from Earth.\n\nAs the rings continue to point nearly toward the Sun, only a\n<a href=\"ap090930.html\">thin shadow of Saturn's rings</a>\nis visible across the center of the planet.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9Ot4ymMeQ&amp;NR=1\">Close inspection</a> of Saturn's rings, however, shows superposed bright features identified as\n<a href=\"ap090602.html\">spokes</a> that are thought to be groups of very small electrically charged ice particles.\n\nUnderstanding the nature and\n<a href=\"http://ciclops.org/view/2275/The_Spoke_Search?js=1\">dynamics of spokes</a> is not fully understood and remains a\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009DPS....41.2509M\">topic of research</a>.",
