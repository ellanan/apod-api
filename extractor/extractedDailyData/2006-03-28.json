  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow often does an asteroid whiz by the Earth?  \n \nThe \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Animations/Animations.html\">above \ntime-lapse animation</a> follows the orbit of the \nEarth around the Sun for two months in 2002 as numerous \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids\">asteroids</a>, \nalso known as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet\">minor planets</a>, \napproach and pass by.  \n \nSome asteroids \n<a href=\"ap041001.html\">appear out of nowhere</a> \nas they are plotted only when they were discovered.  \n \nMost asteroids plotted were \n<a href=\"ap040322.html\">discovered only</a> during the previous year.  \n \nAlthough none of the plotted objects came inside the orbit of our Moon, our Solar System is \n<a href=\"ap050417.html\">filled with objects</a> as small as bits of sand, usually left by a comet, that appear as meteors as they streak into the Earth's atmosphere every day.  \n \nThe only objects displayed are those visible from \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">Earth</a> closer than 20 million kilometers, \ncolor coded by three-dimensional distance.   \n \nIn comparison, the Earth is a relatively \nsmall target having a radius of about 6,400 kilometers.\n \nOne \n<a href=\"http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/asteroid-threat/asteroid_threat.html\">significant research area</a> \nin modern astronomy involves trying to find the \nmajority of asteroids that could pose a \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/\">future collision threat</a> with Earth.",
