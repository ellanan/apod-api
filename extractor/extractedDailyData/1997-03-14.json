  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Comet Hale-Bopp is living up to its expectations.\n Besides the brightness of its <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#coma\">coma</a>,\na comet is typically remembered by the length of its <a href=\"ap960326.html\">tails</a>.\nAs visible in the <a href=\"http://www.sunrise.it/associazioni/aac/comete/95o10397.htm\">above picture</a>\ntaken last week, <a href=\"http://www.halebopp.com/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>'s\nblue <a href=\"ap960319.html\">ion tail</a> shows a dramatic extension,\nwith <a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/news/news.shtml\">current reports</a>\nof about 20 degrees from dark locations.  The comet's white <a href=\"ap970201.html\">dust</a>\ntail has so far shown a more modest extent but appears to be growing\nsignificantly.   Comet Hale-Bopp's closest approach to the <a href=\"ap970226.html\">Sun</a>\noccurs in about two weeks, and although it will not get much closer\nto the Sun than does our Earth, <a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/comets/hbguide.shtml\">Comet Hale-Bopp is likely to tell even more spectacular tails then.</a>\n<br>",
