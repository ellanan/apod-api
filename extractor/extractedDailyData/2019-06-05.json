  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe constellation of Orion is much more than three stars in a row.\n\nIt is a direction in space that is \n<a href=\"ap150316.html\">rich</a> with impressive nebulas.\n\nTo better appreciate this well-known swath of sky, a new  \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/405837/0/\">long exposure image</a> \nwas taken over several clear nights in January, February and March.\n\nAfter 23 hours of camera time and \nuntold hours of image processing, the featured collage in the light of\n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/moonrox/index.html\">oxygen</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mddfu3TXaRw\">sulfur</a> \nwas produced spanning over 40 times the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter\">angular diameter</a> of \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/about/in-depth/\">the Moon</a>. \n\nOf the many interesting details that have become visible, \none that particularly draws the eye is \n<a href=\"ap090224.html\">Barnard's Loop</a>, \nthe bright red orange arc just to the right of the image center. \n\nThe Rosette Nebula is <i>not</i> the giant orange nebula just to the left of the image center -- that is larger but lesser known nebula known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh2-264\">Meissa Ring</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap150225.html\">Rosette Nebula</a> <i>is</i> visible, though: it is the bright orange, blue and white nebula near the image bottom. \n\nThe bright orange star just left of the frame center is \n<a href=\"ap100106.html\">Betelgeuse</a>, \nwhile the bright blue star on the upper right is \n<a href=\"ap180115.html\">Rigel</a>.\n\nAbout those \n<a href=\"ap090210.html\">famous three stars</a> that cross the belt of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)\">Orion the Hunter</a> -- \nin this busy frame they can be hard to locate, but a \n<a href=\"https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/puppy-looks-through-magnifying-lens-450w-1183864630.jpg\">discerning eye</a> \nwill find them just to the right of the image center.",
