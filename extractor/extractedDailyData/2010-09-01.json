  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat does Earth look like from the planet Mercury?\n\nThe robotic spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/index.html\">MESSENGER</a> \nfound out as it looked toward the \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> during its closest approach to the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Sun</a> about three months ago.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap080903.html\">Earth and Moon</a> \nare visible as the double spot on the lower left of the \n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?image_id=388\">above image</a>.  \n\nNow MESSENGER was not at Mercury when it took the above image, but at a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otF2FjpCyZk\">location</a> \nfrom which the view would be similar.  \n\nFrom Mercury, both the \n<a href=\"ap030526.html\">Earth</a> and its \n<a href=\"ap011015.html\">comparatively large moon</a> will always appear as small circles of reflected sunlight and will never show a \n<a href=\"ap091213.html\">crescent</a> phase.  \n\nMESSENGER has zipped right by \n<a href=\"ap080121.html\">Mercury</a> three \n<a href=\"ap081008.html\">times</a> since being \n<a href=\"ap040814.html\">launched</a> in 2004, and is scheduled to enter orbit around the innermost planet in March of 2011.",
