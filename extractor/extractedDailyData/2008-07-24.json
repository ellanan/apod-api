  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThese detailed Hubble Space Telescope close-ups\nfeature Jupiter's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nGreat_Red_Spot#Observation_history\">ancient swirling</a> storm system\nknown as the\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/29/index.html\">Great Red Spot</a>.\n\nThey also\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2008/27/\">follow the progress</a> of two newer storm\nsystems that have grown to take on a similar reddish hue:\nthe smaller \"Red Spot Jr.\" (bottom), and smaller still,\na \"baby red spot\".\n\nRed Spot Jr. was seen to form\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/02mar_redjr.htm\">in\n2006</a>, while the smaller spot was just identified\n<a href=\"ap080523.html\">earlier</a> this year.\n\n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/2008/27/images/e/\nformats/compass_large_web.jpg\">For scale</a>,\nthe Great Red Spot has almost twice the diameter\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\njupiterfact.html\">of planet</a> Earth.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02863\">Moving</a>\nhorizontally from left to right past the Great Red Spot,\nRed Spot Jr. clearly went below the larger storm,\nbut the smaller spot was pulled in.\n\nEmerging on the right, the baby spot's stretched and now paler\nshape is indicated by the arrow in the frame from July 8.\n\nIt is expected that the baby red spot will be pulled back and\nmerge, becoming part of the giant storm system.",
