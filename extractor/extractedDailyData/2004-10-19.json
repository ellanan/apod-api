  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are some older stars surrounded by dust?  \n\nObservations from the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> by a team led by \n<a href=\"http://www.as.arizona.edu/department/faculty/rieke.html\">George Rieke</a> \n(<a href=\"http://www.as.arizona.edu/\">U. Arizona</a>) \nwere expected to show that young stars, \non the order of one million years old, have large \n<a href=\"ap990120.html\">dust disks</a>, while relatively older stars, \nbetween 10 and 100 million years old, have none.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://cougar.jpl.nasa.gov/HR4796/anim.html\">conventional wisdom</a> was that the \n<a href=\"ap021011.html\">dust disks</a> surrounding young \nstars were still forming planets, while in older systems \nthese disks had dissipated after planets had already formed.  \n\nUnexpectedly, \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2004-17/release.shtml\">they found</a> some older stars with the \n<a href=\"http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu/public/infrared.html\">infrared</a> glow of impressive rings or disks of \n<a href=\"ap010813.html\">dust</a>.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2004-17/release.shtml\">possible explanation</a> is that the \nold disks are <a href=\"ap020724.html\">remnant debris</a> from violent collisions \nbetween many forming planets of rock. \n\nResultant <a href=\"ap040825.html\">dust rings</a> from such a scenario \nare depicted by an artist's illustration \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2004-17/ssc2004-17a.shtml\">above</a>.",
