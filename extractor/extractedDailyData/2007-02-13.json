  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe explosion is over but the consequences continue. \n\nAbout eleven thousand years ago a star in the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vel/index.html\">Vela</a> could be seen to \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL1xUWgBlFw\">explode</a>, \ncreating a strange point of light briefly visible to humans living near the beginning of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting\">recorded history</a>. \n\nThe outer layers of the star crashed into the \n<a href=\"ap020210.html\">interstellar medium</a>, driving a \n<a href=\"ap020313.html\">shock wave</a> that is still visible today. \n\nA roughly spherical, expanding shock wave is \n<a href=\"ap960612.html\">visible in X-rays</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.skyfactory.org/vela/vela.htm\">above image</a> \ncaptures much of that filamentary and gigantic shock in \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/visible.html\">visible light</a>, \nspanning almost 100 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> \nand appearing twenty times the diameter of the \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">full moon</a>.\n\nAs gas flies away from the detonated star, it \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/exhibit/cgro_snr.html\">decays</a> and reacts with the interstellar medium, \nproducing light in many different colors and energy bands.\n\nRemaining at the center of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Supernova_Remnant\">Vela Supernova Remnant</a> is a \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/pulsars.html\">pulsar</a>, a star as dense as nuclear matter that completely rotates \nmore than ten times in a single second.",
