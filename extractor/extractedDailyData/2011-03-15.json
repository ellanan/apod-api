  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it look like to approach Saturn in a spaceship?\n\nOne doesn't have to just imagine -- the\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">Cassini spacecraft</a>\ndid just this in 2004,  recording thousands of images along the way, and\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/\">thousands more</a> since entering orbit.\n\nRecently, some of these images have been digitally tweaked, cropped, and compiled into the\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/11386048\">above inspiring video</a> which is part of a larger developing\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imax\">IMAX</a> movie project named\n<a href=\"http://www.outsideinthemovie.com/\">Outside In</a>.  \n\nIn the last sequence, Saturn looms increasingly large on approach as\n<a href=\"ap090505.html\">cloudy Titan</a> swoops below.\n\nWith Saturn whirling around in the background, Cassini is next depicted flying over\n<a href=\"ap090517.html\">Mimas</a>, with large\n<a href=\"ap100511.html\">Herschel Crater</a> clearly visible.\n\nSaturn's majestic rings then take over the show as Cassini crosses Saturn's\n<a href=\"http://ringoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pac-man-ring.jpg\">thin ring</a> plane.\n\nDark shadows of the ring appear on\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11141\">Saturn itself</a>.\n\nFinally, the enigmatic ice-geyser moon\n<a href=\"ap090628.html\">Enceladus</a> appears in the\ndistance and then is approached just as the video clip ends.",
