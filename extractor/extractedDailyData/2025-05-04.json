  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow fast can a black hole spin? \n\nIf any object made of regular matter spins too fast -- it breaks apart.\n\nBut a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/\">black hole</a> might not be able to break apart -- \nand its maximum spin rate is really unknown.\n\nTheorists usually model rapidly rotating black holes with the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_black_hole\">Kerr solution</a> to Einstein's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity\">General Theory of Relativity</a>, which predicts several \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process\">amazing</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_TU6T4-0LU\">unusual</a> things. \n\nPerhaps its most easily testable prediction, though, is that matter entering a \n<a href=\"http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/SpinNEW.pdf\">maximally rotating black hole</a> should be last seen \norbiting at near the speed of light, as seen from far away.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-nustar-helps-solve-riddle-of-black-hole-spin/\">This prediction</a> was tested by NASA's \n<a href=\"https://nustar.caltech.edu/\">NuSTAR</a> and ESA's \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/XMM-Newton\">XMM</a> \nsatellites by observing the supermassive \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/black-holes/\">black hole</a> at the center of \n<a href=\"ap241113.html\">spiral galaxy NGC 1365</a>.\n\nThe near <a href=\"ap111018.html\">light-speed limit</a> was \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Natur.494..449R/abstract\">confirmed by measuring</a> the heating and \n<a href=\"https://physicsopenlab.org/2017/09/07/spectral-lines-broadening/\">spectral line broadening</a> \nof nuclear emissions at the inner edge of the surrounding \n<a href=\"ap140323.html\">accretion disk</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia16695-black-holes-monsters-in-space-artists-concept/\">Pictured here</a> is an artist's illustration \ndepicting an accretion disk of normal <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/27/spinning_black_hole_scientists_measure_supermassive_black_hole_rotating.html\">matter swirling</a> around a black hole, with a \n<a href=\"ap110828.html\">jet</a> emanating from the top.\n\nSince matter randomly falling \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">into the black hol</a><a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21666\" <=\"\" a=\"\">e</a> \nshould not spin up a black hole this much, \nthe NuSTAR and XMM measurements also validate the existence of the \n<a href=\"ap080811.html\">\nsurrounding accretion disk</a>.",
