  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:  \n\nThe life-cycles of stars help drive the ecology of our Galaxy,\n<a href=\"ap970424.html\">churning, processing, and redistributing matter</a>.\n\nMassive stars reach a spectacular evolutionary endpoint -\n<a href=\"ap970225.html\">supernovae explosions which blast off</a>\ntheir outer layers, violently merging stellar material with the\n<a href=\"ap960605.html\">gas and dust of the Milky Way</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/ic443_nugget/nugget.html\">The supernova remnant IC 443</a> is typical of the aftermath.  Seen in\nthis false color\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/basic/\nxray/xray_information.html\">X-ray image</a> are the shocked,\nexpanding shells of gas from a star which\nexploded thousands of years ago.\n\nKnown to be interacting with\n<a href=\"ap970430.html\">galactic molecular clouds</a>, the expanding\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/\noutreach_pages/snr_page.html\">supernova remnant</a> was also recently discovered to have regions of\nintense higher energy X-ray emission (coded blue in this map)\nnear the molecular cloud boundaries.\n\n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/AAS_188_IC443/\nAAS_IC443_Poster.html\">This X-ray emission may indicate</a> that electrons are\nbeing accelerated within the remnant, gaining in energy as they surf back\nand forth across the expanding shock wave.\n\nIf so, IC 443 could also be one source of\n<a href=\"ap961016.html\">our Galaxy's puzzling high energy cosmic-rays</a>.",
