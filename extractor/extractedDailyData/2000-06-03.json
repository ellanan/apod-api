  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNine years ago the massive\n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Compton\nGamma Ray Observatory</a>, the second of\nNASA's space-based <a href=\"http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/\nInstructional.Materials/Curriculum.Support/Technology/\nModels/NASA's.Great.Observatories.Kit/.index.html\">great observatories</a>,\nwas deployed in low earth orbit.\n\nLofted above the protective atmosphere, Compton's instruments\ncould <a href=\"ap980321.html\">explore</a> the extreme high-energy\n<a href=\"http://universe.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Universe</a> in\ngamma rays -- photons with 100,000 times or more the\nenergy of visible light.\n\nThe premier gamma-ray observatory far exceeded expectations\nfor a two- to five-year mission, but a\n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/cgroend.html\">recent gyroscope\nfailure</a> has prompted NASA to decide to steer the satellite safely\nback into the atmosphere.\n\nIllustrated above,\n<a href=\"http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/spacesci/structure/\nreentry.htm\">the controlled re-entry</a> will occur\nearly tomorrow, June 4th, in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean,\napproximately 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii.\n\nThe re-entry location,\nthe largest area (about 10 million square miles)\ndevoid of any populated land available for the observatory's re-entry,\nwas selected to virtually eliminate\nthe risk of human casualty.\n\nCompton's lasting\n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/epo/posters/Greatest_Hits/\nindex.html\">legacy of discovery</a>\nwill include the detection of more than 400 celestial\n<a href=\"ap000324.html\">gamma-ray sources</a>,\n10 times more than were previously known; and\nmore than 2,500 <a href=\"http://www.batse.com/\">gamma-ray bursts</a>.",
