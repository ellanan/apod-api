  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA composite of three consecutive exposures,\n<a href=\"http://www.johnkrausphotos.com/\">this night skyscape</a> follows\nthe January 7 launch and first stage landing of a Falcon 9 rocket from\na beach on\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=84737\">planet\nEarth's space coast</a>.\n\nWith the launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the bright streak\nbeginning farthest left traces the initial phase of the rocket's flight.\n\nA visible upward hook marks the first stage beginning its return\ntrajectory with a \"boostback burn\" near the top of the arc,\nwhile the second stage separates and continues toward orbit.\n\nAbove the top of the launch arc due to perspective,\na bright streak shows the returning first stage slowing and descending\ntoward the Cape.\n\nCentered below, the streak at the horizon is a 17 second burn\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/130608600@N05/39585578201\">finally\nslowing</a> the first stage to a successful vertical landing about 8\nminutes after launch at\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Zone_1\">Landing Zone 1</a>.\n\nDuring the scene's effective long exposure time, the background\nstars leave short trails in the night sky of the\n<a href=\"ap140130.html\">rotating planet</a>.",
