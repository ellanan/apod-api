  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo you see it?  \n\nThis common question frequently precedes the rediscovery of one of the most commonly recognized configurations of stars on the northern sky: the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dipper\">Big Dipper</a>.  \n\nThis grouping of stars is one of the few things that has likely been seen, and will be seen, by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation\">every generation</a>.   \n\nThe Big Dipper is not by itself a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#History_of_the_constellations\">constellation</a>.  \n\nAlthough part of the constellation of the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Ursa_Major.html\">Great Bear</a> (Ursa Major), the \n<a href=\"ap050218.html\">Big Dipper</a> is an \n<a href=\"http://maps.seds.org/Const/asterism.html\">asterism</a> \nthat has been known by different names to different societies.\n\nFive of the \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/big-and-little-dippers-highlight-northern-sky\">Big Dipper stars</a> are actually near each other in \nspace and were likely formed at nearly the same time.  \n\nConnecting two \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> in the far part of the Big Dipper will lead one to \n<a href=\"ap130421.html\">Polaris</a>, the North Star, which is part of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Dipper\">Little Dipper</a>.   \n\nRelative <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-space/constellations.html\">stellar motions</a> will cause the \n<a href=\"http://www.dustbunny.com/afk/constellations/bigdipper/\">Big Dipper</a> to slowly change its \n<a href=\"ap170417.html\">configuration</a> over the next 100,000 years.\n\nPictured in late April, the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yMKwrBpis\">Big Dipper</a> \nwas actually imaged twice -- above <a href=\"ap151005.html\">and</a> \nbelow distant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altiplano#/media/File:SajamaPark.jpg\">Chilean volcanoes</a>, the later reflected from an unusually calm lagoon.",
