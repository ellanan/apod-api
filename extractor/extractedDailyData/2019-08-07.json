  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis is a good month to see Jupiter.\n\nTo find \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">our Solar System</a>'s largest planet in your sky, \nlook toward the southeast just after sunset -- \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> should be the brightest object in that part of the sky. \n\nIf you have a binoculars or a small telescope, you should be able to \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RmqCQpyBISI\">see Jupiter</a>'s \nfour brightest \n<a href=\"ap160710.html\">moons right nearby</a>, \nand possibly some cloud bands.\n\nThe featured image was taken about a month ago from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf\">Persian Gulf</a>.\n\nThe image shows Jupiter just to the right of the nearly vertical band of the central disk of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nThe unnamed rock formations appear in projection like the jaws of a giant monster ready to engulf the Jovian giant. \n\nWhen you \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\">see Jupiter</a>, \nit may be interesting to know that NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/\">Juno</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">spacecraft</a> is simultaneously \n<a href=\"ap190205.html\">visiting</a> and studying the \n<a href=\"ap190508.html\">giant planet</a>. \n\nSaturn is also visible this month, and although it is \n<a href=\"ap190617.html\">nearby to Jupiter</a>, it is not as bright.",
