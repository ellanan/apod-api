  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/news/news.shtml#CometWorldwide\">Comet\nC/2001 A2 (LINEAR)</a> has crossed the celestial equator and is\nheading north.\n\n<a href=\"ap010625.html\">Outward bound</a>,\nthis <a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/comets/comets.html\">primordial\npiece</a> of the solar system is still\njust visible to the unaided eye and can now be sighted by northern\nhemisphere skygazers as it moves\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/images/01A2/LINEAR-A2-2.gif\">through\nthe constellation</a> Pisces.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophotographer.com/C2001A2.html\">This\npicture of the comet</a> is a combination of 33 individual one minute\nexposures made on June 30 with a small telescope and\ndigital camera situated in central Arizona, USA.\n\nThe composite image brings out faint details\nin <a href=\"ap010531.html\">the comet's tail</a> which\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#01A2\">was\nreported</a> to extend for several degrees,\nbeyond the camera's roughly 2 degree field of view.\n\nClosely spaced, the combined exposures were registered on the\ncomet so background stars appear trailed.\n\nTo produce the \"punctuation\" at the end of each\n<a href=\"ap980912.html\">star trail</a>, two exposures\nnear the end of the sequence were left out.\n\nAs a result, the final dots nicely reveal the pattern of the\nbackground star field.",
