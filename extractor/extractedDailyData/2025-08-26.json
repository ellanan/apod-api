  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's hovering above the Sun? \n\nA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-solar-prominence/\">solar prominence</a>.\n\nA prominence is a crest of hot gas expelled from the \n<a href=\"ap111106.html\">Sun's surface</a> that is held aloft by the \n<a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml\">Sun's magnetic field</a>. \n\nProminences can last for days, can suddenly \n<a href=\"ap190526.html\">explode into space</a>, or just \n<a href=\"ap180527.html\">fall back</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>. \n\nWhat decides a prominence's fate is how the \n<a href=\"https://nationalmaglab.org/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/places/magnetic-field-of-sun/\">Sun's complex magnetic field</a> changes --\nthe field's direction can act like an \n<a href=\"ap020602.html\">offramp</a> for trapped \n<a href=\"https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/4-what-is-the-sun-made-of-\">solar particles</a>.\n\nThe 3-second (repeating) time-lapse \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/198200988@N02/54712530388/\">featured video</a> was captured earlier this month from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/27mN_t5Njyo\">Ottawa</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario\">Ontario</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>.\n\nIt shows the development of a \n<a href=\"ap230801.html\">larger-than-Earth prominence</a> \nas it appears to leak solar \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)\">plasma</a> back to the Sun, over the course of an hour.\n\nWhat is unusual is that the prominence appears to hover -- \nmore simple and typical prominences form \n<a href=\"ap250730.html\">magnetic loops</a> that connect back to the surface. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Frsw2dom73l711.jpg\">Many hours after</a> this video ended, the \n<a href=\"ap240902.html\">hovering prominence</a> disintegrated back into the Sun.",
