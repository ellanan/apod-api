  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening to this spiral galaxy?\n\nAlthough details remain uncertain, \nit surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1107/\">featured galaxy</a> \nis labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its \n<a href=\"colliding_galaxies.html\">collisional partner</a> is known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arp_273\">Arp 273</a>.\n\nThe overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its \n<a href=\"ap161218.html\">blue outer ring</a> -- \nis likely a result of wild and \n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-10-galaxies-collide.html\">violent</a> \n<a href=\"http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/Gravity/tides.html\">gravitational</a> \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">interactions</a>.\n\nThis ring's blue color is caused by massive stars that are \n<a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/3.html\">blue hot</a> \nand have formed only in the past few million years. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap150211.html\">inner galaxy</a> appears older, redder, and threaded with cool \n<a href=\"ap151023.html\">filamentary dust</a>. \n\nA few bright \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> appear well in the foreground, unrelated to \n<a href=\"https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/galaxy-catalog/ugc.html\">UGC</a> 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background. \n\n<a href=\"ap110421.html\">Arp 273</a> lies about 300 million light years away \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1107a/\">toward</a> \nthe constellation of Andromeda. \n\nQuite likely, UGC 1810 will \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/19964-milky-way-galaxy-cannibalism-hubble.html\">devour</a> its \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_galaxies_of_the_Milky_Way\">galactic sidekick</a> over the next billion years and settle into a classic \n<a href=\"ap120107.html\">spiral form</a>.",
