  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe dark, inner shadow of planet Earth\nis called <a href=\"ap060909.html\">the umbra</a>.\n\nShaped like a cone extending into space, it has a\ncircular cross section most easily seen during a\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/lunar-eclipses/\">lunar\neclipse</a>.\n\nFor example, on January 21 the <a href=\"ap080220.html\">Full Moon\nslid</a> across the northern half of Earth's umbral shadow,\n<a href=\"ap190125.html\">entertaining</a>\nmoonwatchers around much of the planet.\n\nIn the total phase of the eclipse, the Moon was completely within\nthe umbra for 63 minutes.\n\nRecorded under clear, dark skies from the\nhills near Chiuduno, Italy this composite\neclipse image uses <a href=\"ap070901.html\">successive</a>\npictures from totality (center) and partial phases\nto trace out a large part of the\numbra's <a href=\"ap080820.html\">curved edge</a>.\n\nReflecting sunlight scattered by the atmosphere into Earth's shadow,\nthe lunar surface appears reddened during totality.\n\nBut close to the umbra's edge, the limb of the eclipsed Moon shows a\ndistinct blue hue.\n\n<a href=\"ap151003.html\">The blue eclipsed</a>\nmoonlight originates as rays of sunlight\npass through layers high in the upper stratosphere,\ncolored by ozone that scatters red light and transmits blue.",
