  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could fly over Pluto's moon Charon -- what might you see?\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft did just this in 2015 July as it \n<a href=\"ap170731.html\">zipped past Pluto</a> and Charon with cameras blazing. \n\nThe images recorded allowed for a digital reconstruction of much of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(moon)\">Charon</a>'s surface, \nfurther enabling the creation of fictitious flights over Charon created from this data. \n\nOne such fanciful, minute-long, time-lapse video is \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy9jIikX62o\">shown here</a> with vertical heights and colors of surface features digitally enhanced. \n\n<a href=\"https://www-b.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21864\">Your journey</a> begins over a wide chasm that divides different types of \n<a href=\"ap151002.html\">Charon's landscape</a>s, \na chasm that might have formed when \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/pluto-s-big-moon-charon-reveals-a-colorful-and-violent-history\">Charon</a> froze through.\n\nYou soon turn north and fly over a colorful depression dubbed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor_Macula\">Mordor</a> that, \none hypothesis holds, is an \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/science/pluto-moon-charon.html\">unusual remnant</a> from an ancient impact. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-video-soars-over-pluto-s-majestic-mountains-and-icy-plains\">Your voyage</a> continues over an \n<a href=\"ap131230.html\">alien landscape</a> \nrich with never-before-seen craters, mountains, and crevices. \n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> has now been targeted at \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt\">Kuiper Belt</a> object \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69\">2014 MU 69</a>, \nwhich it should zoom past on New Year's Day 2019.",
