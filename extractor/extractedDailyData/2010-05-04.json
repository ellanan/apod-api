  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you tried to enter this hall of fog, you would find it\ndissipates around you.\n\nThe hall is actually an\n<a href=\"ap091004.html\">optical illusion</a> created by \nsunlight backscattering off of a cloud passing below the peak of \n<a href=\"ap020819.html\">the mountain</a> from which this picture was taken.\n\nKnown as a\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogbow.htm\">fogbow</a>\nand similar in some ways to \n\"the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nGlory_%28optical_phenomenon%29\">glory</a>\", the phenomenon is sometimes\n<a href=\"ap040806.html\">seen from airplanes</a>. \n\nThe ring's center appears near the image bottom where the shadow of the\nphotographer is visible.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwyjlIETJi4\">This shadow</a>\nwould likely change as clouds passed, \ncreating a faux moving giant known as the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocken_spectre\">Brocken Spectre</a>. \n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27891676@N05/4456534223/\">In\nthe picture</a>, several concentric rings of the fogbow appear to create\na hall for this\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nIn_the_Hall_of_the_Mountain_King\">mountain king</a>. \n\nThe cause of fogbow \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supers.htm\">supernumeraries arcs</a> and glories have \nonly been understood recently and are relatively complex. \n\n<a href=\"http://graffiti.virgin.net/ljmayes.mal/var/\nglorytxt.htm\">Briefly</a>, small droplets of water \n<a href=\"http://www.play-hookey.com/optics/\nreflect1.html\">reflect</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.physics.uoguelph.ca/applets/Intro_physics/\nrefraction/LightRefract.html\">refract</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction/\nindex.html\">diffract</a> sunlight backwards towards the Sun.\n\nAtmospheric backscattering <a href=\"http://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/raylee/\nRainbowBridge/Chapter_8.html\">phenomena</a> have a\ncounterpart in astronomy, where looking out from planet Earth\nin the direction opposite the Sun yields a bright spot called \n<a href=\"ap080507.html\">the gegenschein</a>.",
