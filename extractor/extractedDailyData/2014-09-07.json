  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever watched the Moon rise?\n\nThe slow rise of a nearly full moon over a clear horizon can be an impressive sight.\n\nOne impressive moonrise was imaged in early 2013 over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Victoria,_Wellington\">Mount Victoria</a> Lookout in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington\">Wellington</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a>.\n\nWith <a href=\"http://markg.com.au/2013/01/full-moon-silhouettes/\">detailed planning</a>, an \n<a href=\" http://markg.com.au/about/\">industrious astrophotographer</a> \nplaced a camera about two kilometers away and pointed it across the lookout to where \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18017\">the Moon</a> \nwould surely soon be making its nightly debut.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/58385453\">above single shot sequence</a> is unedited and \nshown in real time -- it is <i>not</i> a time lapse.\n\nPeople on \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8zlUhcmlsc\">Mount Victoria Lookout</a> \ncan be seen in <a href=\"http://www.blifaloo.com/shadow-puppets/index.php\">silhouette</a> themselves admiring the dawn of Earth's largest satellite.\n\nSeeing a <a href=\"ap101205.html\">moonrise</a> yourself is not difficult: \nit happens every day, although only half the time at night.\n\nEach day the \n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">Moon rises</a> about \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q1038.html\">fifty minutes later</a> \nthan the previous day, with a full moon \n<a href=\"ap111127.html\">always rising</a> at sunset. \n\nA good time to see a moonrise will occur at sunset on Tuesday as \n<a href=\"ap140814.html\">the Moon</a>'s relative closeness to Earth during a full phase -- called a \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/10jul_supermoons/\">supermoon</a> -- will cause it to appear slightly larger and brighter than usual.",
