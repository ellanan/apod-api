  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAn explosion so powerful it was seen clear across the visible universe was recorded in gamma-radiation last week by NASA's orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/main/index.html\">Swift Observatory</a>.\n\nFarther than any known \n<a href=\"ap040217.html\">galaxy</a>, \n<a href=\"ap000419.html\">quasar</a>, or optical \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">supernova</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst\">gamma-ray burst</a> recorded last week was clocked at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Expansion_of_space\">redshift</a> 8.2, making it the farthest explosion of any type \n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/furthestgrb\">yet detected</a>.  \n\nOccurring only 630 million years after the \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_theory.html\">Big Bang</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200911.html\">GRB 090423</a> detonated so early that astronomers had no direct evidence that anything explodable even existed back then.\n\nThe faint infrared afterglow of \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-17-09.html\">GRB 090423 was recovered</a> by large ground telescopes within minutes of being discovered.\n\nThe afterglow is circled in the above picture taken by the large \n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/about\">Gemini North Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii\">Hawaii</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nAn exciting possibility is that this \n<a href=\"http://grb.physics.ncsu.edu/grbmovies.html\">gamma-ray burst</a> occurred in one of the very \n<a href=\"ap070102.html\">first generation of stars</a> and \nannounced the birth of an early \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N\">black hole</a>.    \n\nSurely, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_090423\">GRB 090423</a> \nprovides unique data from a relatively \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_III_stars#Population_III_stars\">unexplored epoch</a> in our universe and a distant beacon from which the intervening universe can be studied.",
