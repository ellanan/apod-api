  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat forms lurk in the mists of the Carina Nebula?\n\nThe dark ominous figures are actually \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clouds\">molecular clouds</a>, \nknots of molecular gas and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> so thick they have become \n<a href=\"ap201122.html\">opaque</a>.  \n\nIn comparison, however,  \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNiYGuzZPM\">these clouds</a> are typically much less dense than \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.  \n\nFeatured here is a detailed image of the core of the \n<a href=\"ap190623.html\">Carina Nebula</a>, a part where both dark and colorful \n<a href=\"ap050110.html\">clouds</a> of gas and dust are particularly prominent.  \n\nThe image was captured in mid-2016 from \n<a href=\"https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/siding-spring-observatory\">Siding Spring Observatory</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>. \n\nAlthough the nebula is predominantly composed of \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> gas -- here colored green, \nthe image was assigned colors so that light emitted by trace amounts of \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/16.shtml\">sulfur</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eGES-MrIFo\">oxygen</a> \nappear red and blue, respectively. \n\nThe entire \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula\">Carina Nebula</a>, \ncataloged as NGC 3372, spans over 300 \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> \nand lies about 7,500 light-years away in the \n<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales3.htm\">constellation</a> of Carina.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae\">Eta Carinae</a>, \nthe most energetic star in the nebula, \nwas one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then \n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/vsots_etacar\">faded dramatically</a>.",
