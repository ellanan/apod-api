  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Does an old, red globular cluster have any\nhot, blue stars?  The rightmost picture, taken by the Ultraviolet\nImaging Telescope in <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#uv\">ultraviolet</a>\nlight, shows that indeed it does.  <a href=\"http://fondue.gsfc.nasa.gov/UIT/Astro1/Astro1_pictures.html\">Pictured</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960221.html\">Omega Centauri </a>is the largest known\n<a href=\"lib/globular_clusters.html\">globular cluster </a>in\nour <a href=\"ap960213.html\">Galaxy</a>, containing well over\na million stars.  Many of these stars are evident in the visible\nlight photograph on the left.  When photographed in ultraviolet\nlight, however, different and less numerous stars emerge, as evident\non the photograph on the right.  Most of these stars are thought\nto have evolved past the current stage of our <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a>.\n These stars no longer fuse <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">hydrogen</a>\nto <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#helium\">helium</a> in their core\nbut rather <a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/default.html\">fuse</a>\nhelium into <a href=\"http://mwanal.lanl.gov/julie/imagemap/periodic/6.html\">carbon</a>.\n These stars will soon shed their outer envelopes and end up as\nsmoldering carbon embers known as <a href=\"ap950910.html\">white dwarf</a>\nstars.",
