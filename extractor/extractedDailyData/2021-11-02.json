  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWe've seen this same supernova three times -- when will we see it a fourth? \n\nWhen a distant star explodes in a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aysiMbgml5g\">supernova</a>, \nwe're lucky if we see it even once.\n\nIn <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2021/030/01F9KZX19D6BZJG86J3A3E8FW5\">the case of AT 2016jka</a> (\"SN Requiem\"), \nbecause the exploding star happened to be lined up behind the center of a \n<a href=\"ap180326.html\">galaxy cluster</a> (MACS J0138 in this case), \na comparison of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> images demonstrate that we saw it three times.\n\nThese three <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/\">supernova</a> images are highlighted in circles \nnear the bottom of the left frame taken in 2016.\n\nOn the right frame, taken in 2019, the circles are empty \nbecause all three images of the single supernova had faded.\n\n<a href=\"https://ascl.net/1102.004\">Computer modeling</a> of the cluster lens, \nhowever, indicates that a fourth image of the same \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/subject/7226/supernova/\">supernova</a> \nshould eventually appear in the upper circle on the right image.\n\nBut when?\n\nThe best \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08935\">models predict</a> \nthis will happen in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_millennium#2030s\">2037</a>, \nbut this date is uncertain by about two years because of \nambiguities in the mass distribution of the \n<a href=\"ap210823.html\">cluster lens</a> and the brightness history of the \nstellar explosion.\n\nWith refined \n<a href=\"ap151221.html\">predictions</a> and vigilant monitoring, \n<a href=\"https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/kittens-looking-up-3017017.jpg\">Earthlings</a> living 16 years from now may be able to catch this fourth image -- and perhaps learn more about both galaxy clusters and supernovas at once.",
