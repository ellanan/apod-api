  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you climbed to the top of this 13th century stone tower,\nit looks like\nyou could reach out and touch the\n<a href=\"ap120712.html\">North Celestial Pole</a>,\nthe point at the center of all the star trail arcs.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.gr/\nAstro-Star-Trails-Tower-Marathon-Oinoe-2016.htm\">The well-composed image</a>\nwith scattered meteor streaks was recorded over a period of\nfive and half hours as a series of 45 second long exposures\nspanning the dark of the night on July 7/8.\n\nThe exposures were made with a digital camera fixed to a tripod near\nMarathon, Greece, <a href=\"http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">planet Earth</a>.\n\nOf course, the graceful star trails reflect the\nEarth's <a href=\"ap120802.html\">daily rotation</a> around its axis.\n\nBy extension, the axis of rotation\nleads to the center of the concentric arcs\n<a href=\"ap130920.html\">in the night sky</a>.\n\nConvenient for northern hemisphere\nnight sky photographers and celestial navigators alike, the\n<a href=\"ap110514.html\">bright star Polaris</a>\nis very close to the North Celestial\nPole and so makes the short bright trail in the tower's central gap.",
