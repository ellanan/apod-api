  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow do galaxies grow?\n\nTo help find out, the \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/announcements/ann1813/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> was deployed to image the unusual \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a> \nPGC 42871.\n\nHow this galaxy came to be surrounded by \n<a href=\"ap180206.html\">numerous shells of stars</a> \nmay give clues about how it evolved. \n\nEmbedded in the \n<a href=\"ap140105.html\">diffuse shells</a> are massive \n<a href=\"ap160427.html\">globular clusters of stars</a> -- \nstars which analyses show were born during three different epochs. \n\nThis and other \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....137..383M\">data indicate</a> that \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1516/\">PGC 42871</a> has been in at least two \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">galactic collisions</a>, \nat least one of which might have been with a former \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2132.html\">spiral galaxy</a>.\n\nThe remaining spiral galaxy on the far left is at the same distance as \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1516a/\">PGC 42871</a> and may have been involved in some of the collisions. \n\nPGC 42871 spans about 20 thousand \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> and lies about 270 million light years away \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gYTXaLWqyI\">toward</a> \nthe constellation of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus\">Centaurus</a>.",
