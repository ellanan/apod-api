  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created this unusual space ribbon?  \n\nMost assuredly, one of the most \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">violent explosions</a> \never witnessed by ancient humans.\n\nBack in the year 1006 AD, light reached Earth from a stellar explosion in the \nconstellation of the Wolf \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_(constellation)\">Lupus</a>), \ncreating a \"guest star\" in the sky that appeared \n<a href=\"ap080202.html\">brighter than Venus</a> and lasted for over two years.\n\nThe supernova, now cataloged at \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2008/22/caption.html\">SN 1006</a>, \noccurred about 7,000 light years away and has left a large remnant that continues to expand and fade today. \n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/22/image/a/\">Pictured above</a> is a small part of that \n<a href=\"ap080704.html\">expanding supernova</a> \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/22/image/b/\">remnant</a> dominated by a \n<a href=\"ap030317.html\">thin</a> and outwardly moving \n<a href=\"ap061213.html\">shock</a> front that heats and ionizes \nsurrounding ambient gas.\n\nSN 1006 now has a diameter of nearly 60 \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year\">light years</a>.  \n\nWithin the past year, an \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2008/09/10/blinding-gamma-ray-burst-was-directed-at-earth/\">even more powerful explosion</a> \noccurred far across the universe that was  visible to modern humans, \nwithout any optical aid, for a few seconds.",
