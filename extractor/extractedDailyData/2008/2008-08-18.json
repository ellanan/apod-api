  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nJust before the Sun blacks out, something strange occurs.\n\nAs the Moon moves to completely cover the Sun in a \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html\">total solar\neclipse</a>, beads of <a href=\"ap060917.html\">bright sunlight stream</a> \naround the edge of the Moon.\n\nThis effect, known as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads\">Baily's beads</a>,\nis named after \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Baily\">Francis Baily</a> \nwho called attention to the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000eaa..bookE5118.\">phenomenon</a>\nin 1836.  \n\nAlthough, the number and brightness of \n<a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k/jay-pasachoff/\neclipse/IDZ0Z-SC/wTLUGw#\">Baily's beads</a> used to be unpredictable,\ntoday the Moon \nis so well mapped that general features regarding Baily's beads are expected.\n\nWhen a single bead dominates, it is called the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nDiamond_ring_effect_(solar_eclipse)\">diamond ring effect</a>,\nand is typically seen just before totality.  \n\nPictured above, a series of images recorded Baily's beads at times\nsurrounding the <a href=\"ap080807.html\">recent total solar eclipse</a>\nvisible from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk\">Novosibirsk</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\">Russia</a>.\n\nThe complete series can be seen by scrolling right.\n\nAt the end of totality, as the Sun again emerges from behind the moon, \n<a href=\"http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-iarticle_query?1980BASI....8...81F\">Baily's beads</a>\nmay again be visible -- but now on the other side of the Moon.",
