  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does this crater on Mercury look like a spider?  \n\nWhen the robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER spacecraft</a> \nglided by the planet <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html\">Mercury</a> \nlast month, it was able to image portions of the Sun's closest planet that had never been seen before.\n\nWhen imaging the center of Mercury's extremely large \n<a href=\"ap960120.html\">Caloris Basin</a>, \nMESSENGER found a crater, <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=144\">pictured above</a>, with a set of unusual \n<a href=\"ap050305.html\">rays</a> emanating out from its center.  \n\nA crater with such troughs has never been seen before anywhere in \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/index.cfm\">our Solar System</a>.\n\nWhat isn't clear is the <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/0130_MESSENGERs_First_Mercury_Flyby_Reveals.html\">relation</a> of the crater to the radial troughs.\n\nPerhaps the crater created the \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2008/01/30/spiders-on-mercury/\">radial rays</a>, or perhaps the two features appear only by a chance superposition -- \nthe topic is sure to be one of future research.\n\nMESSENGER is <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/timeline/index.html\">scheduled</a> to fly past Mercury twice more before \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKoB0MHVBvM\">firing its thrusters</a> to \nenter orbit in 2011.",
