  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSunday, the sky seemed to smile over much of planet Earth.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cosmos4u.blogspot.com/2008/12/tons-of-marvellous-pictures-document.html\">Visible</a> the world over was an unusual superposition of our Moon and the planets Venus and Jupiter.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=01&amp;month=12&amp;year=2008\">Pictures taken at the right time</a> show a crescent Moon that appears to be a smile when paired with the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_conjunction\">planetary conjunction</a> of seemingly nearby Jupiter and Venus.  \n\nPictured above is the scene as it appeared from \n<a href=\"http://www.mtwilson.edu/his.php\">Mt. Wilson Observatory</a> \noverlooking \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles\">Los Angeles</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> \nafter sunset on 2008 November 30.  \n\nHighest in the sky and farthest in the distance is the planet \n<a href=\"ap080718.html\">Jupiter</a>.  \n\nSignificantly closer and visible to Jupiter's lower left is \n<a href=\"ap080202.html\">Venus</a>, \nappearing through Earth's atmospheric clouds as unusually blue.  \n\nOn the far right, above the horizon, is our Moon, in a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lunar-Phase-Diagram.png\">waxing crescent</a> phase.  \n\nThin clouds illuminated by the Moon appear unusually orange.   \n\nSprawling across the bottom of the image are the hills of Los Angeles, many covered by a thin haze, while \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles\">LA skyscrapers</a> are visible on the far left. \n\nThe conjunction of \n<a href=\"ap081129.html\">Venus and Jupiter</a> will \ncontinue to be \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/planets/\">visible</a> \ntoward the west after sunset during much of this month.  \n\nHours after the taking of this image, however, \nthe Moon approached the distant duo, briefly \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=02&amp;month=12&amp;year=2008\">eclipsed Venus</a>, and then moved on.",
