  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat caused this sudden cloud of dust on Mars?  An avalanche!  \n\nThe first \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0RWLxOFGLY\">avalanche</a> \nimaged in progress on another planet was recorded last month on \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a> by\nNASA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/overview/\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>.  \n\nVisible in the \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/gallery/press/20080303a.html\">above picture</a>, digitally rescaled, are several layers of \n<a href=\"ap070701.html\">white ice thawing over red rock</a>, \nwith darker colors toward the right indicated \n<a href=\"ap040206.html\">Martian soil</a> that mixed with lesser amounts of ice.  \n\nAs the <a href=\"ap070723.html\">cliff</a> of over 700 meters high was \n<a href=\"ap080303.html\">thawing</a>, \nfalling ice crashed down raising plumes of ice and dust so thick they cast \n<a href=\"ap070610.html\">visible shadow</a>s.  \n\nThe scarp has slopes with grades greater than 60 degrees.  \n\nThe entire scene is illuminated from the upper right by the Sun.  \n\nA thaw occurs each spring in the \n<a href=\"ap020604.html\">Northern Hemisphere</a> of Mars, as the warming climate causes solid \n<a href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/286601/dry_ice/\">carbon dioxide ice</a> to \nsublimate directly to vapor. \n\nStudying such avalanches allows planetary geologists to better understand \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\">soil</a> configurations on Mars.",
