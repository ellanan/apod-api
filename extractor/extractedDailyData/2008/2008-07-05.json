  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSometimes the sky itself is the best show in town.  \n\nIn January 2007, people from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth%2C_Western_Australia\">Perth</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> \n\ngathered on a local beach to \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">watch a sky</a> light up with delights near and far.  \n\nNearby, fireworks exploded as part of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day\">Australia Day</a> celebrations.  \n\nOn the far right, \n<a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/lightning/\">lightning</a> from a \n<a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/hazard/thunderstorm/index.shtm\">thunderstorm</a> \nflashed in the distance.  \n\nNear the image center, though, seen through clouds, was the most unusual sight of all: \n<a href=\"ap070122.html\">Comet McNaught</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_mcnaught_page21.php\">photogenic comet</a> was so bright that it even remained visible though the din of Earthly flashes.  \n\nComet McNaught has now returned to the outer Solar System and is now \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2006P1.html\">only visible</a> \nwith a large telescope.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://jkemppainen.com/antti/index.php?pic=00111auspva0.jpg\">above image</a> \nis actually a three photograph panorama digitally processed to reduce \nred reflections from the exploding \n<a href=\"http://people.howstuffworks.com/fireworks.htm\">firework</a>.",
