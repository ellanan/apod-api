  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe northern <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/mars/\ncalendar.html\">Martian summer</a> is waning.\n\nAs predicted, a decline in daylight hours, deteriorating weather,\nand dust storms are preventing solar arrays on the\n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/index.php\">Phoenix Mars Lander</a>\nfrom providing power.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/\nphoenix-20081110.html\">Phoenix's last signal</a> was received on\nNovember 2, its successful mission ending after more than five months\nin the arctic region of the Red Planet, a run that\nexceeded its planned operational lifetime.\n\nAttempting to discover\n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars101.php\">if Mars' surface</a>\nhas ever been able to support microbial life, Phoenix performed\nan extensive analysis of the soil and returned a\nwealth of image data.\n\nOf course, one of the lander's most exciting results was the\ndetection of <a href=\"ap080621.html\">water-ice near</a> the Martian\nsurface.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11379\">Recorded\nin October</a>, this picture from the lander's Robotic Arm Camera\nshows the region under the Phoenix with flat, exposed icy patches.\n\n<a href=\"ap080612.html\">That area</a> caused researchers to\nexclaim \"<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/\n0601_Holy_Cow_Snow_Queen_Phoenix_Landed_on.html\">Holy Cow!</a>\" when\nit was first imaged a few days after the May 25\n<a href=\"ap080530.html\">touchdown</a> of the Phoenix Mars Lander.",
