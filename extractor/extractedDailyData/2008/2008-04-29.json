  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are these Earthlings going?  \n\nMillions of <a href=\"ap030305.html\">people</a> move about \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">planet Earth</a> by airplane every day.  \n\nHundreds of thousands of \n<a href=\"http://www.natca.org/mediacenter/bythenumbers.msp#1\">airplane flights</a> \ntake place over the US every day.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/flightpatterns/\">dramatic graphical \ndepiction</a> of these flights was created by \n<a href=\"http://users.design.ucla.edu/~akoblin/bio.html\">Aaron Koblin</a> \nand is shown above.  \n\nClicking on the \n<a href=\"http://users.design.ucla.edu/~akoblin/work/faa/index.html\">above image</a> \nwill bring up a movie in many web browsers, a movie that might better be visible \n<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=dPv8psZsvIU\">here</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://users.design.ucla.edu/~akoblin/work/faa/FinalA.mov\">movie</a> \ndepicts flight patterns that occurred over a few days in 2005 March.  \n\nThe count on the lower left shows the number of \nUSA-related flights at the time listed on the lower right.  \n\nThe trails shown are not \n<a href=\"ap041013.html\">contrails</a> but rather generated artificially by a computer algorithm.\n\nMajor cities in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_america\">North America</a> and the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA\">USA</a> are discernable.\n\nInspection of the movie shows that some times of the day are busier than others, indicating that flights leave some destinations at times that are convenient for travelers.\n\nIn terms of distance, flying to a distant location is \n<a href=\"http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99845.htm\">much safer than driving</a> to that location.  \n\nFlying in an airplane, however, remains slightly <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE5D81730F937A15752C1A962958260\">more dangerous than driving</a> to a \n<a href=\"http://www.world-airport-codes.com/\">nearby airport</a>.",
