  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBorn on June 26th in 1730,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/biograph.html\">astronomer Charles Messier</a> scanned 18th century French skies\nfor comets.\n\nTo avoid confusion and aid his comet hunting, he\ndiligently recorded this object as number 27 on\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/m-cat.html\">his\nlist of things</a> which are definitely not comets.\n\nIn fact, 21st century astronomers would classify it as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">Planetary\nNebula</a>, but it's not a planet either, even though it may\n<a href=\"ap030614.html\">appear round</a>\nand planet-like in a small telescope.\n\nMessier 27 (M27) is now\nknown to be an excellent example of a\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/\">\ngaseous emission nebula</a> created\nas a <a href=\"ap050123.html\">sun-like star runs out</a>\nof nuclear fuel in its core.\n\nThe nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into\nspace, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying\nstar's intense but invisible\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nemspectrum.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.\n\nKnown by the popular name of the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m027.html\">Dumbbell\nNebula</a>, the beautifully\nsymmetric interstellar gas cloud is over 2.5 light-years across and\nabout 1,200 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vul/index.html\">constellation\nVulpecula</a>.\n\nThis impressive color composite highlights subtle jet\nfeatures in the nebula.\n\nIt was recorded with a robotic\ntelescope sited in Hawaii using narrow band\nfilters sensitive to emission from oxygen atoms (shown in\ngreen) and hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe hydrogen\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series\">emission is</a>\nseen as red (H-alpha) and fainter\nbluish hues (H-beta).",
