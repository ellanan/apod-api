  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAdrift in the\n<a href=\"ap081107.html\">rich star fields</a>\nof the constellation Cygnus, this\nlovely, symmetric bubble nebula was only recently recognized and may\nnot yet appear in astronomical catalogs.\n \nIn fact, amateur astronomer\n<a href=\"http://www.starimager.com/\">Dave Jurasevich</a> identified\nit as a nebula on July 6 in\n<a href=\"http://www.starimager.com/Image%20Gallery%20Pages/\nHydrogen%20Alpha%20Images/\nic%201318_AP_8%20pane%20mosaic_bubble%20nebula.htm\">his\nimages</a> of the complex\nCygnus region that included the Crescent Nebula (NGC 6888).\n\nHe subsequently notified the International Astronomical Union.\n\nOnly eleven days later the same object was independently identified by\nMel Helm at <a href=\"http://www.sierra-remote.com/\">Sierra Remote</a>\nObservatories,\nimaged by Keith Quattrocchi and Helm, and also submitted to the IAU\nas a potentially <a href=\"http://www.lostvalleyobservatory.com/\nnebula.1/\">unknown nebula</a>.\n\nTheir final <a href=\"http://www.lostvalleyobservatory.com/\npage29crescentbubblenb/\">composite image is</a> seen here,\nincluding narrow-band image data that highlights the\nnebula's delicate outlines.\n\nWhat is the newly recognized bubble nebula?\n\nLike the <a href=\"ap080813.html\">Crescent Nebula</a>\nitself, this cosmic bubble could be blown by\nwinds from a massive\n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pberlind/atlas/htmls/\nwrstars.html\">Wolf-Rayet star</a>, or it could be a\nspherically-shaped <a href=\"ap010123.html\">planetary nebula</a>,\na final phase in the life of a sun-like star.",
