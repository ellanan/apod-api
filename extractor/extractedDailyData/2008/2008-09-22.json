  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday is an equinox, a date when day and night are equal.   \n\nTomorrow, and every day until the next \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">equinox</a>, \nthe night will be longer than the day in Earth's northern hemisphere, \nand the day will be longer than the night in Earth's southern hemisphere.  \n\nAn <a href=\"ap040320.html\">equinox</a> \noccurs midway between the two \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice\">solstice</a>s, \nwhen the days and nights are the least equal.  \n\nThe picture is a composite of hourly images taken of the Sun above \nBursa, Turkey on key days from solstice to \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSdDeooDQEY\">equinox</a> to solstice.  \n\nThe bottom Sun band was taken during the \n<a href=\"ap071222.html\">winter solstice</a> in 2007 December, when\nthe Sun could not rise very high in the sky nor stay above the\nhorizon very long.    \n\nThis lack of Sun caused \n<a href=\"ap041130.html\">winter</a>.\n\nThe top Sun band was taken during the \n<a href=\"ap060621.html\">summer solstice</a> in 2008 June, when the\nSun rose highest in the sky and stayed above the horizon\nfor more than 12 hours.   \n\nThis abundance of Sun caused \n<a href=\"ap080705.html\">summer</a>.\n\nThe middle band was taken during the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/the_universe/uts/equinox.html\">Vernal Equinox</a> in 2008 March, but it is the same sun band that \n<a href=\"ap080421.html\">Earthlings</a> will see today, the day of the \n<a href=\"http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/equinox.html\">Autumnal Equinox</a>.",
