  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nRecently discovered Makemake is one of the largest objects known in the outer Solar System.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/07/make-make.html\">Pronounced MAH-kay MAH-kay</a>, this \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb.html\">Kuiper belt</a> \nobject is only slightly smaller than Pluto, orbits the Sun only slightly further out than \n<a href=\"ap060903.html\">Pluto</a>, and appears only slightly dimmer than Pluto.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makemake_%28dwarf_planet%29\">Makemake</a>, however, has an orbit much more tilted to the \n<a href=\"ap001014.html\">ecliptic plane</a> of the planets than Pluto.  \n\nDesignated <a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/orbits/2005fy9.html\">2005 FY9</a> \nsoon after its discovery by a team led by \n<a href=\"http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/\">Mike Brown</a> \n(<a href=\"http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/\">Caltech</a>) in 2005, \nthe outer Solar System orb was recently renamed \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makemake_%28mythology%29\">Makemake</a> \nfor the creator of humanity in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapa_Nui_mythology\">Rapa Nui mythology</a> of \n<a href=\"ap040524.html\">Easter Island</a>.\n\nAdditionally, Makemake has been recently classified as a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a> under the \n<a href=\"http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0804/\">new subcategory plutoid</a>, making Makemake the third cataloged \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutoid\">plutoid</a> after Pluto and \n<a href=\"ap070619.html\">Eris</a>.  \n\nMakemake is known to be a world \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133..284B\">somewhat red</a> in appearance, with spectra indicating it is \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...445L..35L\">likely covered</a> with frozen \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a>.\n\nSince no images of \n<a href=\"http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/07/whats-in-name-part-2.html\">Makemake</a>'s surface yet exist, an artist's illustration originally meant to depict \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna\">Sedna</a> \nhas been boldly co-opted above to now illustrate Makemake.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/\">hypothetical moon</a> \nis visualized above nearly in the direction of our distant Sun.",
