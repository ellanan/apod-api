  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow do stars form?   \n\nTo better understand this complex and chaotic process, astronomers used the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nto image in unprecedented detail the star forming region \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LH_95\">LH 95</a> in the nearby \n<a href=\"ap060510.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> galaxy.  \n\nUsually only the brightest, bluest, most massive stars in a \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/stellar_nurseries.html\">star forming region</a> \nare visible, but the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2006/55/image/a/\">above image</a> was taken in such high resolution and in such specific colors \nthat many recently formed stars that are more yellow, more dim, \nand less massive are also discernable.   \n\nAlso visible in the \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/55/caption.html\">above scientifically colored image</a> \nis a blue sheen of diffuse \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/1.html\">hydrogen gas</a> heated by the \nyoung stars, and \n<a href=\"http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/lrn/psg_main.html\">dark dust</a> \ncreated by stars or during \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWr8U7czifU\">supernova explosion</a>s.\n\nStudying the locations and abundances of \n<a href=\"ap010604.html\">lower mass stars</a> in star forming regions and around \n<a href=\"ap060409.html\">molecular cloud</a>s helps uncover what conditions \nwere present when they formed. \n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/55/fast_facts.html\">LH 95</a> \nspans about 150 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> and lies about 160,000 light years away toward the southern \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation\">constellation</a> of the \nSwordfish (<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=33\">Dorado</a>).",
