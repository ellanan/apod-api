  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow could a galaxy become shaped like a ring? \n\nEven more strange: how could two?  \n\nThe rim of the blue galaxy \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/37/fastfacts/\">pictured</a> on the right shows an immense ring-like structure 30,000 <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, \nmassive stars. \n\nThis blue galaxy is part of the interacting galaxy system known as \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJ...399L..51G\">Arp 147</a>, and shows a ring because it has recently collided with the other galaxy in the frame, the red galaxy on the left.  \n\nUnusually, even this red galaxy shows a \n<a href=\"ap060118.html\">ring</a> like band, although it is seen nearly edge-on.\n\nWhen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXy3B2K47Qg\">galaxies collide</a>, they pass through each other -- their individual stars rarely come into contact. \n\nClouds of \n<a href=\"ap000411.html\">interstellar gas</a> and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> become condensed, causing a wave of star formation to move out from the impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/37/image/a/\">above image</a> was taken last week by NASA's \n<a href=\"http://hubble.nasa.gov/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nto demonstrate the ability of its \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFPC2\">Wide Field \nPlanetary Camera 2</a> after some <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/news/launch_delay_092908.html\">recent technical difficulties</a>.",
