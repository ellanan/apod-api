  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nStickney Crater, the largest crater on the martian moon Phobos,\nis named for\n<a href=\"http://maia.usno.navy.mil/women_history/hall.html\">Chloe\nAngeline Stickney</a> Hall,\nmathematician and wife of astronomer Asaph Hall.\n\nAsaph Hall discovered both the\n<a href=\"ap031024.html\">Red Planet's moons</a> in 1877.\n\nOver 9 kilometers across, Stickney is nearly half the\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001348\">diameter\nof Phobos itself</a>, so large that the\nimpact that blasted out the crater likely came close\nto shattering the tiny moon.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/phobos.php\">stunning,\nenhanced-color image</a> of Stickney and surroundings\nwas recorded by the HiRISE camera onboard the\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it passed within some\nsix thousand kilometers\n<a href=\"ap031129.html\">of Phobos</a> last month.\n\nEven though the surface gravity of\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/phobos.html\">asteroid-like Phobos</a>\nis less than 1/1000th Earth's gravity, streaks suggest loose\nmaterial has slid down inside the crater walls over time.\n\nLight bluish regions near the crater's rim could indicate\na relatively freshly exposed surface.\n\nThe origin of the\n<a href=\"ap041120.html\">curious grooves</a> along the surface is\nmysterious but may be related to the crater-forming impact.",
