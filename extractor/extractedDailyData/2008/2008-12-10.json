  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLook through the cosmic cloud cataloged as\n<a href=\"http://collab.digitaluniverse.net/wiki/NGC_281\">NGC 281</a>\nand it's almost easy to miss stars of open cluster\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AJ....113.2116G\">IC 1590</a>.\n\nBut, formed within the nebula, that cluster's young, massive stars\nultimately power the pervasive\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/\nemission_nebulae.html\">nebular glow</a>.\n\nThe eye-catching shapes looming in\n<a href=\"http://www.rdelsol.net/NGC281/NGC281.html\">this colorful\nportrait</a> of NGC 281\nare sculpted columns and dense\n<a href=\"ap020108.html\">dust globules</a> seen in silhouette,\neroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation\nfrom the hot cluster stars.\n\nIf they survive long enough,\nthe dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation.\n\nSometimes called the <a href=\"ap050823.html\">Pacman Nebula</a> because\nof its overall shape in\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/13/supplemental.html\">wider-field</a>\nviews, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/\">Cassiopeia</a>.\n\nThis composite image was made through\n<a href=\"ap071102.html\">narrow-band</a> filters\nand shows emission from the nebula's hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms\nin green, red, and blue hues.\n\nIt spans over 80 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 281.",
