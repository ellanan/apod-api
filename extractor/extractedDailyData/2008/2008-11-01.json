  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nMenacing\n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/intro/intro1.html\">flying</a>\nforms and garish colors are a mark of the Halloween season.\n\nThey also stand out in\n<a href=\"http://www.backyardastronomer.com/ccd/veileast.htm\">this\ncosmic close-up</a> of the eastern Veil Nebula. \n\n<a href=\"ap051206.html\">The Veil Nebula</a> itself is a\nlarge supernova remnant, the expanding\ndebris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nWhile the Veil is roughly circular in shape covering nearly 3 degrees\non the sky in the constellation Cygnus, this portion of the eastern\nVeil spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/\n28oct_halloweensky.htm\">of the Moon</a>.\n\nThat <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\nscale_distance.html\">translates</a> to 12 light-years at the Veil's\nestimated distance of 1,400 light-years from planet Earth.\n\nIn this composite of image data recorded through\n<a href=\"ap071102.html\">narrow band</a> filters,\nemission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong\nemission from oxygen atoms in greenish hues.\n\nIn the western part of the Veil lies another seasonal apparition,\n<a href=\"ap070101.html\">the Witch's Broom</a>.",
