  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis helmet-shaped cosmic cloud with\nwing-like appendages is popularly called\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/n2359.html\">Thor's\nHelmet</a>.\n\nHeroically sized even for a\n<a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/t/thor.html\">Norse god</a>,\nThor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across.\n\nIn fact, the helmet is actually more like\n<a href=\"ap051107.html\">an interstellar bubble</a>, blown as a fast\nwind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center sweeps\nthrough a surrounding molecular cloud.\n\nKnown as a\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/\n980603a.html\">Wolf-Rayet star</a>, the central star is an\nextremely hot giant thought to be in a brief,\npre-<a href=\"ap050910.html\">supernova</a> stage of evolution.\n\nCataloged as NGC 2359, the nebula is located about\n15,000 light-years away in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.internal.org/view_poem.phtml?poemID=115\">Canis\nMajor</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/NGC2359AU.html\">sharp\nimage</a> captures striking details of the\nnebula's filamentary structures and also\nrecords an almost emerald color from strong emission\n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.llnl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/Nebula/\nForbidden.html\">due to oxygen</a> atoms in the glowing gas.",
