  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nComet McNaught was perhaps the most photogenic comet of our time. \n\nAfter making\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/\napod_search?McNaught\">quite a show</a> in the northern hemisphere\nin early January, \nthe comet moved south and developed a \n<a href=\"ap070122.html\">long and unusual dust tail</a> that \n<a href=\"ap070212.html\">dazzled southern hemisphere observers</a>. \n\nIn <a href=\"http://astrosurf.com/sguisard/SGU-Mc_Naught-IMG_3758-V1-S-cp8.jpg\">this image</a>, Comet McNaught was captured one year ago above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.  \n\nThe bright comet dominates on the left while\npart of its magnificent tail\nspreads across the entire picture.    \n\nFrom this vantage point in the Andes Mountains, one looks up toward \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_mcnaught.php\">Comet\nMcNaught</a> and a magnificent sky,\nacross at a crescent moon,\nand down on clouds, atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze\">haze</a>,\nand the city lights of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago%2C_Chile\">Santiago</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_McNaught\">Comet McNaught</a> \nhas glided into the outer Solar System and is now only visible as a speck\nin a large telescope.  \n\nThe other spectacular comet of 2007, \n<a href=\"ap071205.html\">Comet Holmes</a>, has also faded from easy view.",
