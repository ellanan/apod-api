  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTwo days ago, the MESSENGER spacecraft became only the \nsecond spacecraft in human history to swoop past Mercury.  \n\nThe last spacecraft to visit the Sun's closest planet was \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_10\">Mariner 10</a> over \n<a href=\"http://www.shop4fancydress.com/images/adults/hire/70s_classic_chic3.jpg\">35 years ago</a>.  \n\nMariner 10 was not able to \n<a href=\"ap040912.html\">photograph Mercury</a>'s entire \n<a href=\"ap030216.html\">surface</a>, and the \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-mercury.html\">images it did send back</a> raised many questions.  \n\nTherefore, much about \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29\">planet Mercury</a> \nremains unknown.  \n\nThis week's flyby of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> \nwas only the first of three flybys.  \n\nOver the next few years <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/MESSENGERTimeline/TimeLine_content.html\">MESSENGER will swing past</a> twice more and finally enter Mercury's orbit in 2011.\n\nMESSENGER is currently moving too fast to enter orbit around Mercury now.   \n\nThe <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=117\">above image</a> was taken two days ago during MESSENGER's flyby and shows part of Mercury's surface that has \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001299/\">never been imaged</a>\nin detail before.\n\nMany more <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/index.php\" \"=\"\">detailed images of Mercury</a> \nare expected to be sent back over the next few days.  \n\nThe data acquired by \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/index.html\">MESSENGER</a> \nwill hopefully help scientists \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/Land_of_Confusion_f.html\">better understand</a> how Mercury's surface was formed, and why it is so dense.",
