  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow common are planetary systems like our own Solar System? \n\nIn the twelve years previous to 2008, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_with_confirmed_extrasolar_planets\">over 300 candidate planetary systems</a> have been found orbiting nearby stars.   \n\nNone, however, were directly imaged, few showed evidence for multiple planets, and many had a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting inside the orbit of Mercury. \n\nLast week, however, together with \n<a href=\"ap080919.html\">recent image</a>s of \n<a href=\"ap081114.html\">Fomalhaut b</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2008/0811hia_e.html\">above picture</a> was released showing one of first confirmed images of planets orbiting a distant Sun-like star.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/13/AR2008111302267.html\">HR 8799</a> has a mass about 1.5 times that of our own Sun, and lies about 130 light years from the Sun -- a distance similar to many stars easily visible in the night sky.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.keckobservatory.org/article.php?id=231\">Pictured above</a>, a 10-meter \n<a href=\"ap960715.html\">Keck telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii\">Hawaii</a> \ncaptured in infrared light three planets orbiting an artificially obscured central star.   \n\nThe 8-meter \n<a href=\"ap030909.html\">Gemini North</a> \ntelescope captured a \n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/11151\">similar image</a>.  \n\n\nEach planet likely contains several times the mass of \n<a href=\"ap080108.html\">Jupiter</a>, but even the innermost planet, \nlabelled d, has an orbital radius near the equivalent of the Sun-\n<a href=\"ap020922.html\">Neptune</a> distance.   \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_8799\">HR 8799 planetary system</a> has significant differences with our Solar System, it is a \n<a href=\"http://www.keckobservatory.org/movies/11-13-08.html\">clear demonstration</a> that complex planetary systems exist, systems that could conceivable contain an \n<a href=\"http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/overview_index.cfm\">Earth-like planet</a>.",
