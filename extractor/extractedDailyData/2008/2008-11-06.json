  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis dramatic image of Jupiter is touted as the\n<a href=\"http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/10/\n02_mcao.shtml\">sharpest picture</a>\nof the entire gas giant ever taken from the ground.\n\nThe picture was made using a prototype instrument known as\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2007/\npr-19-07.html\">MAD</a> (Multi-conjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator)\nmounted on one of the European Southern Observatory's 8-meter diameter\n<a href=\"ap061104.html\">Very Large Telescope units</a> in Chile.\n\nWorking at <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/\ncosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/what_is_ir.html\">infrared</a>\nwavelengths the MAD instrument\nremoves <a href=\"ap000725.html\">atmospheric blurring</a>, the bane\nof earthbound telescopes,\nby using multiple guide stars and deformable mirrors to sense and\ncorrect for the distortions produced by turbulence in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nHydrogen and methane deep in\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html\">Jupiter's</a>\nown thick atmosphere\nabsorb light at infrared wavelengths.\n\nSo, this sharper view shows the infrared sunlight reflected\nfrom the giant planet's high level haze\n<a href=\"ap030313.html\">prominent in</a> the equatorial regions\nand near the poles.\n\nIt reveals features as small as 300 kilometers across.\n\nThe promising technique can also be applied to imaging other\nextended objects like star clusters and nebulae.",
