  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGiant star forming region W5 is over 200 light-years across\nand about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/A_FALL/CASS_O.HTM\">Cassiopeia</a>.\n\nW5's sculpted clouds of cold gas and dust seem to\nform fantastic shapes in this\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/\nssc2008-15/release.shtml\">impressive mosaic</a> of\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\ntimeline/timeline_onepage.html\">infrared</a> images\nfrom the\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer\nSpace Telescope</a>.\n\nIn fact, the area on the right includes the structures previously\ndubbed the <a href=\"ap071215.html\">Mountains of Creation</a>.\n\nNew evidence <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3284\">indicates</a>\nthat successive generations of stars\nformed in the W5 region in an expanding pattern of triggered\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/StarForm.html\">star\nformation</a>.\n\nThe older, earlier generations of stars seem to cluster\nnear the middle of the enormous cavities, with younger stars\nseen near the rims.\n\nWinds and radiation from the older, central stars likely carve out\nand compress surrounding\n<a href=\"http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar\nmaterial</a>, triggering the\ncollapse that gave rise to younger, later generations of stars\nfarther out.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/mediaimages/zooms/\">In\nthe false-color image</a>,\nheated dust still within the cavities\nappears red, while the youngest stars are forming in the whitish areas.\n\nW5 is also known as IC 1848, and together with IC 1805 it is part of\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0110338\">a complex</a>\nregion popularly dubbed the\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/A_FALL/IC1805.HTM\">Heart and\nSoul Nebulae</a>.",
