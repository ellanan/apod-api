  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy did an acidic haze spread across Venus?  \n\nThe unusual clouds were discovered last July by \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>'s robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Express\">Venus Express</a> \nspacecraft currently orbiting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus\">Venus</a>.  \n\nThe bright and smooth \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMIVTVHJCF_index_0.html\">haze</a> was found by Venus Express to be rich in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid\">sulfuric acid</a>, created when an unknown process lifted water vapor and \n<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/oar/urbanair/so2/index.html\">sulphur dioxide</a> \nfrom lower levels into \n<a href=\"ap040516.html\">Venus' upper atmosphere</a>.  \n\nThere, sunlight broke these molecules apart and some of them recombined into the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPGRtUPyvs8\">volatile sulfuric acid</a>. \n\nOver the course of just a few days last July, the smooth acidic clouds spread from the \n<a href=\"ap070501.html\">South Pole of Venus</a> across half the planet. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esa-mmg/mmg.pl?b=b&amp;topic=Solar%20System&amp;subtopic=Venus&amp;single=y&amp;start=14\">above false-color picture</a> of Venus was taken last July 23rd in \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/uv.html\">ultraviolet light</a>, \nand shows the unusual haze as relatively smooth regions across the image bottom.\n\nThe cause of the <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMIVTVHJCF_index_0.html\">dark streaks</a> in the clouds is also not yet understood and is being researched.",
