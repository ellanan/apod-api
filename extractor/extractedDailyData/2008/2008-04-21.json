  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThere are more bacteriophages on Earth than any other life-like form.  \n\nThese small \n<a href=\"http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/yellowstone/viruslive.html\">viruses are not clearly a form of life</a>, \nsince when not attached to bacteria they are completely dormant.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage\">Bacteriophages</a> \nattack and eat \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria\">bacteria</a> \nand have likely been doing so for over 3 billion years ago. \n\nAlthough initially discovered early last century, the tremendous abundance of \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20030712/bob9.asp\">phages</a> \nwas realized more recently when it was found that a single drop of common seawater typically contains millions of them.  \n\nExtrapolating, \n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89380684\">phages</a> \nare likely to be at least a billion billion (sic) times more numerous than humans.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phage.jpg\">Pictured above</a> is an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrograph\">electron micrograph</a> of over a dozen bacteriophages attached to a single bacterium.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.intralytix.com/Intral_PhageHistory.htm\">Phages</a> are very \n<a href=\"http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/mmi/stannard/emimages.html\">small</a> -- \nit would take about a million of them laid end-to-end to span even one millimeter.  \n\nThe ability to kill bacteria makes phages a \n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-158576750.html\">potential ally</a> \nagainst bacteria that cause human disease, although \n<a href=\"http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/faculty/inman/empics/virus.htm\">bacteriophages</a> \nare not yet well enough understood to be in wide spread medical use.",
