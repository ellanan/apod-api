  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nImagine a pipe as wide as a state and as long as half the Earth.  \n\nNow imagine that this pipe is filled with \n<a href=\"ap970904.html\">hot gas moving</a> 50,000 kilometers per hour.  \n\nFurther imagine that this pipe is not made of metal but a transparent \n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/Magnetic/\">magnetic field</a>.  \n\nYou are envisioning just one of thousands of young \nspicules on the \n<a href=\"ap980515.html\">active Sun</a>.  \n\nPictured \n<a href=\"http://www.lmsal.com/Press/spicules2004/\">above</a> \nis perhaps the highest \nresolution image yet of these enigmatic solar flux tubes.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/star_quakes_40728.html\">Spicules</a> dot the \n<a href=\"http://www.lmsal.com/Press/spicules2004/\">above frame</a> of \nsolar active region 10380 that crossed the Sun in 2004 June, \nbut are particularly evident as a \n<a href=\"ap991024.html\">carpet</a> of dark tubes on the right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1WsC1TR-x8\">Time-sequenced images</a> have recently shown that \n<a href=\"ap040611.html\">spicules</a> last about five minutes, \nstarting out as \n<a href=\"ap050216.html\">tall tubes</a> \nof rapidly rising gas but eventually \nfading as the gas peaks and falls back down to the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Sun</a>.  \n\nThese images also indicate that the ultimate cause of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spicule_(solar_physics)\">spicules</a> \nis sound-like waves that flow over the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a>'s \nsurface but leak into the \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a>'s atmosphere.",
