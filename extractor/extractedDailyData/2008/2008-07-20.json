  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSoft hues, partially lit orbs, a thin trace of the ring, and slight shadows highlight this understated view of the majestic surroundings of the giant planet Saturn.  \n\nLooking nearly back toward the Sun, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens\">robot Cassini \nspacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn captured \n<a href=\"ap060618.html\">crescent phases</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> and its \n<a href=\"ap060530.html\">moon Rhea</a> in color a few years ago.\n\nAs striking as the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07806\">above image</a> is, it is but a single frame from a recently released \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA07806.mov\">60-frame silent movie</a> where Rhea can be seen gliding in front of its parent world.   \n\nSince Cassini was nearly in the plane of \n<a href=\"http://pds-rings.seti.org/saturn/\">Saturn's rings</a>, the normally impressive rings are visible here only as a \n<a href=\"ap051219.html\">thin line</a> across the image center.\n\nAlthough Cassini has now concluded its \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">primary mission</a>, \nits past successes and opportunistic location have prompted \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> to start a two-year \n<a href=\"http://ciclops.org/view_event/87/Cassinis_Next_Chapter_Begins\">Equinox Mission</a>, further exploring not only Saturn's enigmatic moons \n<a href=\"ap060215.html\">Titan</a> and \n<a href=\"ap060310.html\">Enceladus</a>, but Saturn herself as her grand \n<a href=\"ap950801.html\">rings tilt right at the Sun</a> in August 2009.",
