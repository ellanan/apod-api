  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSaturn's ragged moon Rhea has one of the oldest surfaces known. \n \nEstimated as changing little in the past billion years, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_%28moon%29\">Rhea</a> shows \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater\">craters</a> \nso old they no longer appear round � their \nedges have become compromised by more recent cratering.  \n \nLike <a href=\"ap051113.html\">Earth's Moon</a>, \nRhea's rotation is locked on Saturn, and the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08173\">above image</a> shows part of \n<a href=\"ap051213.html\">Rhea's surface</a> that always faces Saturn.\n \nRhea's leading surface is more highly cratered than its trailing surface.  \n \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?rhea\">Rhea</a> is composed mostly of water-ice but is thought to include about 25 percent rock and metal. \n \nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09898\">above image</a> \nwas taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEM9D2HHZTD_0.html\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn.  \n \nCassini swooped past \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07572\">Rhea</a> \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/calendar/ca0804.html\">last month</a> \nand captured the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09898\">above image</a> \nfrom about 350,000 kilometers away.\n \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/rhea.html\">Rhea</a> \nspans 1,500 kilometers making it Saturn's second largest moon after \n<a href=\"ap060215.html\">Titan</a>.\n \nSeveral \n<a href=\"ap050215.html\">surface features on Rhea</a> \nremain unexplained including <a href=\"ap050530.html\">large light patch</a>es like those seen near the image top.",
