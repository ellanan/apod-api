  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nCompact and round, NGC 7008 is recognized as a planetary nebula\nabout 2,800 light-years distant in the\n<a href=\"ap070920.html\">nebula rich</a> constellation of Cygnus.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.stargazer-observatory.com/ngc7008.html\">impressive\ntelescopic view</a> shows off NGC 7008's remarkable\ncolors and details by the skillful combination of broad band and\nnarrow band images from two different telescopes with about\n12 hours of total exposure time.\n\nThe intriguing <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2008/06/30/\ncosmic-mystery-ngc-7008-by-dietmar-hager/\">assortment of features</a>\nwithin the nebula's approximately 1 light-year\ndiameter suggest its popular name, the Fetus Nebula, but\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebulae</a>\nare not associated with star birth.\n\nInstead, nebulae like NGC 7008 are produced during a\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/\">brief phase</a>\nthat sun-like stars pass through toward the end of \ntheir lives.\n\nEjecting their outer layers, the stars cool to eventually\nbecome <a href=\"ap000910.html\">white dwarf stars</a>,\nlike the star seen near the center of NGC 7008.\n\nThis colorful image also includes an unrelated but still lovely\ngold and blue binary star system just\n<a href=\"http://www.perezmedia.net/beltofvenus/archives/\n000817.html\">below NGC 7008</a>.",
