  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat does the surface of Saturn's ice-spewing moon Enceladus look like?  \n\nTo help find out, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens\">robotic Cassini \nspacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> was sent \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pfz1n6tMUg\">soaring past</a> the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryovolcano\">cryovolcanic</a> \nmoon and even right through one of Enceladus' \n<a href=\"ap060608.html\">ice plumes</a>.   \n\nCassini closed to about 52 kilometers during its closest encounter to date.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=4857\">above unprocessed image</a> \nwas taken looking down from the north, from about 30,000 kilometers away.    \n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001360/\">Visible</a> \nare at least two types of terrain.  \n\nThe first type of terrain has more craters than occur near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28moon%29\">Enceladus</a>' South Pole.   \n\nThe other type of terrain has few craters but many \nridges and grooves that may have been created by \n<a href=\"ap980102.html\">surface-shifting</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic\">tectonic</a> activity.  \n\nExogeologists are currently poring over this and other \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm\">Cassini images</a> \nfrom last Wednesday's flyby to better understand the moon's patch-work surface, its unusual \n<a href=\"ap071013.html\">ice-geysers</a>, and its potential to support life.  \n\nCassini is scheduled to <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/products/pdfs/20080312_enceladus_mission_description.pdf\">fly by Enceladus</a> at least nine more times, including an even closer pass of just 25 kilometers this coming October.",
