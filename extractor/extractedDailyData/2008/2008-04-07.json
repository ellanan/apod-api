  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat caused this unusual white rock formation on Mars?  \n\nIntrigued by the possibility that they could be <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080320-mars-salt.html\">salt deposits</a> left over as an ancient \n<a href=\"ap020410.html\">lakebed dried-up</a>, \ndetailed studies of these fingers now indicate that this is not correct.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap020513.html\">light material</a> appears to have \n<a href=\"http://drake.marin.k12.ca.us/stuwork/rockwater/Beach%20Erosion%20-%20Water%20Project/Title%20Page.html\">eroded</a>\naway from the surrounding area, \nindicating a very low-density composition, possibly consistent with volcanic \n<a href=\"ap070918.html\">ash</a> or windblown dust.\n\nThe stark contrast between the rocks and the surrounding \n<a href=\"ap010226.html\">sand</a> is compounded by the sand's\nunusual darkness.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001381/\">This picture</a> \nwas taken from the <a href=\"http://themis.asu.edu/inst.html\">Mars Express</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMFU55V9ED_0.html\">spacecraft</a> currently orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>.  \n\nPlanetary scientist Emily Lakdawalla, among others, has followed her curiosity about this unusual Martian landform into a \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001347/\">fascinating</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001381/\">investigation</a> \nthat is eloquently described in the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/\">Planetary Society Weblog</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://themis.la.asu.edu/zoom-20020419a.html\">mysterious\nwhite rock</a> spans about 15 kilometers across inside a\nlarger crater that spans about 100 kilometers.",
