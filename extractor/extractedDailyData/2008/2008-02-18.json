  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow common are planetary systems like our own?\n\nPerhaps quite \ncommon, as the first system of planets like our own Solar System has been \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/319/5865/927\">discovered</a> \nusing a newly adapted technique that, so far, has probed only six \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system\">planetary systems</a>.  \n\nThe technique, called \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlensing\">gravitational microlensing</a>, \nlooks for telling brightness changes in measured starlight when a foreground \n<a href=\"ap070417.html\">star with planets</a> \nchances almost directly in front of a more distant star.\n\nThe distant star's light is slightly \n<a href=\"ap980624.html\">deflected</a> in predictable ways by the \n<a href=\"http://www.thecleverest.com/animated/147\">gravity</a> of the closer system.\n\nRecently a <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1920\">detailed analysis</a> of \n<a href=\"ap021215.html&quot;\">microlensing</a> system \n<a href=\"http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~ogle/\">OGLE</a>-2006-BLG-109 has related \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~microfun/ob06109/\">brightness variations</a> to two planets that are similar to \n<a href=\"ap050911.html\">Jupiter</a> and \n<a href=\"ap071023.html\">Saturn</a> of our own Solar System.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/science/space/15planets.html\">This discovery</a> carries the tantalizing implication that interior planets, possibly including \n<a href=\"http://tpf.jpl.nasa.gov/earthlike/earth-like.html\">Earth-like planets</a>, \nmight also be common.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_images.jsp?cntn_id=111093&amp;org=NSF\">Pictured above</a> is an artistic conception of how the BLG-109 planetary system might look.",
