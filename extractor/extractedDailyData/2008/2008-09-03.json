  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn July 4th, 2005, the Deep\nImpact spacecraft directed a probe to impact the\n<a href=\"ap050915.html\">nucleus of Comet Tempel 1</a>.\n\nStill cruising through the solar system, earlier this year\n<a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/2science/index.shtml\">the robotic\nspacecraft</a> looked back to record a series of\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/\nepoxi_transit.html\">images of its home world</a>\n31 million miles (50 million kilometers) away.\n\nIn a sequence from top left to bottom right, these four frames from\n<a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/4gallery/Earth-Moon_vid.shtml\">the video\nshow</a> a rotating Earth.\n\nThey combine visible and near-infrared\nimage data with enough resolution and contrast to see\nclouds, oceans, and continents.\n\nThey also follow a remarkable transit of Earth by its\nlarge, natural <a href=\"ap050430.html\">satellite, the Moon</a>.\n\nThe Moon's orbital motion carries it across the field of\nview from left to right.\n\nImaging <a href=\"ap070325.html\">the Earth</a>\nfrom this distant perspective allows\nastronomers to connect overall variations in brightness at\ndifferent wavelengths with planetary features.\n\nThe observations will aid in\n<a href=\"ap070426.html\">the search</a> for earthlike planets in\n<a href=\"http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm\">other planetary\nsystems</a>.",
