  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen the planet Mercury?  \n\nBecause \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/\nmercury.html\">Mercury</a> orbits so close to the Sun, \nit never wanders far from the Sun in\n<a href=\"ap020509.html\">Earth's sky</a>.\n\nIf trailing the Sun, \n<a href=\"mercury.html\">Mercury</a> will be visible \nlow on the horizon for only a short while\n<a href=\"ap020510.html\">after sunset</a>.\n\nIf leading the Sun, Mercury\nwill be visible only shortly before\nsunrise.\n\nSo at certain times of the year an\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance/\narticle_110_1.asp\">informed skygazer</a> with a little determination\ncan usually pick Mercury\nout from a site with an unobscured horizon.\n\nAbove, a lot of determination has been combined \nwith a little \n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/J_DIGIT/\nETHICS.HTM\">digital trickery</a> to\nshow Mercury's successive positions during March of 2000.  \n\nEach picture was taken from the same location in Spain \nwhen the Sun itself was 10 degrees below the \n<a href=\"ap970909.html\">horizon</a> and superposed \non the single most \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">photogenic sunset</a>.  \n\nMercury is \n<a href=\"http://starfieldobservatory.com/coming.htm\">currently visible in the western sky</a> \nafter sunset, but will disappear in the Sun's glare after a few days.",
