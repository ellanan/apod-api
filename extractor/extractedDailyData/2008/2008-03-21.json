  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe star cataloged as\n<a href=\"http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=HD+189733\">HD 189733</a>\nis a mere 63 light-years away.\n\nIts location is indicated in this deep,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2008/11/image/d/\">wide-angle image</a> of the sky\ncentered on the northern constellation of Cygnus.\n\nConsidering the many bright stars, nebulae, and star clusters\n<a href=\"ap070920.html\">in the region</a>\nmore familiar to skygazers, HD 189733 may not seem to be\nremarkable, but it is known to have at least one\n<a href=\"ap070512.html\">hot, jupiter-sized</a>\nplanet orbiting very close, with an impressively\nshort period of 2.2 days.\n\nBecause the planet regularly eclipses its parent star,\nastronomers can study starlight that\npasses directly through the planet's atmosphere and identify\n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/\nSpectra/irspec.html\">molecules</a>\nthrough <a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/\nSpectra/spec.html\">spectroscopy</a>.\n\nFollowing the discovery of water vapor in the planetary\natmosphere,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2008/11/\">astronomers now report</a> that\nHubble Space Telescope data\nalso indicates the signature of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> (CH4).\n\nThe exciting result is the first detection of an\norganic molecule on a planet orbiting another star.\n\nAlthough HD 189733's planet\nis considered too hot and inhospitable to support life,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1030\">the work is a step</a>\ntoward measuring conditions and chemistry on other\n<a href=\"http://exoplanet.eu/index.php\">extrasolar</a>\nplanets where\n<a href=\"http://www.phy6.org/outreach/poems/frogs.htm\">life could exist</a>.",
