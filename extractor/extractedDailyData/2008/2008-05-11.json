  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would Mars appear to move backwards?  \n\nMost of the time, the apparent motion of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> in \n<a href=\"ap010827.html\">Earth's sky</a> is in one direction, \nslow but steady in front of the far distant stars. \n\nAbout every two years, however, the \n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">Earth passes Mars</a> \nas they orbit around the Sun.  \n\nDuring the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSoR9n7UiEE\">most recent such pass</a> over the last year, \nthe proximity of Mars made the red planet appear \n<a href=\"ap030827.html\">larger and brighter</a> than usual.  \n\nAlso during this time, \n<a href=\"ap060422.html\">Mars appeared</a> to \n<a href=\"ap031216.html\">move backwards</a> in the sky, \na phenomenon called \n<a href=\"http://alpha.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/retrograd.html\">retrograde motion</a>.  \n\nPictured above is a series of images digitally stacked \nso that all of the stars images coincide.  \n\nHere, Mars appears to \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allabout/nightsky/nightsky04.html\">trace out a loop</a> in the sky.  \n\nNear the top of the loop, Earth passed Mars and the \n<a href=\"http://astron.berkeley.edu/~ay7/html/homework/hw1/node3.html\">retrograde motion</a> was the highest.  \n\n<a href=\"ap011220.html\">Retrograde</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WtNMufWmw0\">motion</a> \ncan also be seen for other \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> planets.",
