  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAsteroid 2007 TU24 passed by the Earth yesterday, posing no danger.  \n\nThe space rock, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/asteroid-20080125.html\">estimated</a> to be about 250 meters across, coasted by just outside the orbit of Earth's Moon.   \n\nThe passing was \n<a href=\"ap050417.html\">not very unusual</a> -- small rocks strike Earth daily, \nand in 2003 a rock the size of a bus passed inside the orbit of the Moon, \nbeing <a href=\"ap031015.html\">detected only after passing</a>.\n\nTU24 was notable partly because it was so large.  \n\nWere <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU24\">TU24</a> to have struck land, \nit might have caused a \n<a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/magnitude.html\">magnitude</a> seven \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19fMs633Td4\">earthquake</a> \nand left a city-sized <a href=\"ap990711.html\">crater</a>.  \n\nA perhaps larger danger would have occurred were \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001309/\">TU24</a>  \nto have struck the ocean and raised a large \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami\">tsunami</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-014\">radar image</a> was taken two days ago.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap981129.html\">Arecibo Radio Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico\">Puerto Rico</a> \nbroadcast radar that was reflected by the asteroid and then recorded by the \n<a href=\"http://www.gb.nrao.edu/gbt/\">Byrd Radio Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/administration/personnel_office/greenbank.shtml\">Green Bank</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia\">West Virginia</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-014\">resulting image</a> shows TU24 to have an oblong and irregular shape.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/asteroid-20080128-clips.html\">TU24</a> was discovered only three months ago, indicating that other \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/\">potentially hazardous asteroids</a> might lurk in \n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">our Solar System</a> currently undetected.  \n\nObjects like <a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080128-asteroid-radar.html\">TU24</a> are hard to detect because they are so faint and \n<a href=\"ap060328.html\">move</a> so fast. \n\nHumanity's ability to scan the sky to detect, catalog, and analyze such objects has \n<a href=\"http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/\">increased notably</a> in recent years.",
