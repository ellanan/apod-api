  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDoes Mars always appear the same?  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_sign\">No.</a>  \n\nAs both Earth and Mars orbit the Sun, the \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html\">apparent angular size</a> \nof Mars changes as viewed from the Earth.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrofotografie.nl/Mars.htm\">Pictured above</a> from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enschede\">Enschede</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands\">Holland</a>, \nMars was captured in 2007 and 2008 with 30 separate images, \nall taken with the same magnification.  \n\nWhen <a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> and \n<a href=\"ap010718.html\">Mars</a> are on opposite sides of the Sun, \nMars appears relatively small.  \n\nConversely, when Earth and Mars are near each other, \n<a href=\"ap030813.html\">Mars looms</a> large and bright.\n\nThe largest <a href=\"http://www.dustymars.net/Observing_Mars.html\">Mars</a> has appeared in recent history was the \n<a href=\"ap030828.html\">opposition of August 2003</a>.  \n\nSince Mars is always more distant from the Sun than the Earth, \n<a href=\"ap031112.html\">Mars</a> never shows a crescent phase to Earthlings.  \n\n<a href=\"ap990705.html\">Visible</a> also in the above images are the \n<a href=\"ap021224.html\">north polar cap of Mars</a>, \ndark and light soil, clouds, and, in the early images, a global \n<a href=\"ap011017.html\">dust storm</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/Mars/marsopps.html\">next opposition</a>, when Earth again passes near to Mars, will occur in early 2010.",
