  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you took a picture of the Sun at the same time each day, \nwould it remain in the same position?  \n\nThe answer is no, and the shape traced out by the \n<a href=\"ap000621.html\">Sun</a> over the course of a year is called an \n<a href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Other/analemma.html\">analemma</a>.  \n\nThe Sun's apparent shift is caused by the \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Orbits/earthorbit.html\">Earth's motion</a> around the Sun when combined with the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/the_universe/uts/earth2.html\">tilt of the Earth's</a> rotation axis.  \n\nThe Sun will appear at its highest point of the \n<a href=\"http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunaspattern.html\">analemma</a> during \n<a href=\"ap001223.html\">summer</a> and at its lowest during \nwinter.  \n\nToday, the Winter Solstice day in Earth's northern hemisphere,\nthe Sun is at the bottom of the analemma.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.jgiesen.de/analemma/\">Analemmas</a> \ncreated from different\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude\">latitudes</a> \nwould appear at least slightly different, as well as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma\">analemmas</a> \ncreated at a different time each day.  \n\nThis particular analemma was built up by 46 separate \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">Sun photographs</a> taken during 2003 in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens\">Athens</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>.\n\nPictured in the foreground of \n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Solar-Analemma-130000.htm\">this composite image</a> are pillars called the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Erechtheum_porch.jpg\">Porch of Maidens</a>, part of the ancient \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erechtheum\">Erechtheum</a> \nwhich was completed in 407 BC.",
