  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nPictured above is the first image ever taken of the Earth from the Moon.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/LOIRP/index.html\">The image</a> was taken in 1966 by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_1\">Lunar Orbiter 1</a> and heralded by then-journalists as the \nImage of the Century.\n\nIt was taken about two years before the \n<a href=\"http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/AS08/a08sum.htm\">Apollo 8</a> crew snapped its \n<a href=\"ap051224.html\">more famous color cousin</a>.\n\nRecently, modern technology has allowed the recovery of \nhigher resolution images from old data sources such as \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunarorb.html\">Lunar Orbiter</a> tapes than ever before.  \n\nSpecifically, recovery of the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/LOIRP/loirp-gallery-index.html\">above image</a> was initiated 20 years ago \nby Nancy Evans, and completed recently \nby Dennis Wingo and Keith Cowing who lead the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/LOIRP/index.html\">Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.moonviews.com/\">Project</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/LOIRP/index.html\">Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.moonviews.com/\">Project</a>.  \n\nImages like \n<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10097025-52.html\">that above</a> carry more than aesthetic value -- comparison to \n<a href=\"ap071120.html\">recent high definition images</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMINSD7MmT4\">Moon</a> \nenables investigations into how the \n<a href=\"ap060327.html\">Moon has been changing</a>.",
