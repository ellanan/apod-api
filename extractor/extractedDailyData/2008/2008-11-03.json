  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does Mercury have so many rayed craters?\n\nNo one is sure.  \n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/index.html\">MESSENGER spacecraft</a> that is taking unprecedented images as it swoops past the innermost planet has provided dramatic confirmation that \n<a href=\"ap081008.html\">Mercury</a> has more \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_system\">rayed craters</a> than \n<a href=\"ap050305.html\">Earth's Moon</a>.\n\nPictured \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11371\">above</a>, \na particularly spectacular rayed crater spanning approximately 80 kilometers was imaged by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> \nduring last month's flyby from about 20,000 kilometers up.  \n\nThe rays prevalence is a mystery because \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weathering\">space weathering</a> \neffects such as dust accumulation and \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml\">solar wind</a> attenuation should be greater on Mercury than on the Moon.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008cosp...37.2737S\">Hypothesized solutions</a> currently include the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Icar..192..629N\">optical properties of Mercurian dust</a>, \nand that Mercury's high mass and proximity to the Sun cause more \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t3CyNrpIzg\">violent impacts</a>, thus typically raising more light material.\n\nMESSENGER will <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/MESSENGERTimeline/TimeLine_content.html\">buzz past</a> Mercury again next year before entering orbit in 2011.",
