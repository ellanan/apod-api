  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow many different astronomical phenomena have come together to create the above vista?\n\nSeveral. \n\nFirst, in the foreground, is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake\">Crater Lake</a> -- \na caldera created by volcanism on planet Earth about 7,700 years ago.\n\nNext, inside the lake, is water. \n\nAlthough the origin of the water in the crater is melted snowfall, \nthe origin of water on Earth more generally is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth\">unclear</a>, \nbut <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963\">possibly related</a> to ancient Earthly-impacts of \n<a href=\"ap100726.html\">icy bodies</a>.\n\nNext, the green glow in the sky is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow\">airglow</a>, \nlight emitted by atoms high in the Earth's atmosphere as they recombine \nat night after being separated during the day by energetic sunlight.\n\nThe many points of light in the sky are stars, glowing by \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/astfus.html\">nuclear fusion</a>.  \n\nThey are far above the atmosphere but \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/250lys.html\">nearby to our Sun</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nFinally, the <a href=\"ap120911.html\">bright arch</a> across the image is the \n<a href=\"ap110710.html\">central band</a> of the Milky Way, \nmuch further away, on the average, than the nearby stars, and \n<a href=\"ap120717.html\">shaped mostly by gravity</a>.\n\nContrary to appearances, the Milky Way band glows by \nitself and is not illuminated by the airglow.\n\nThe above image is a six-frame panorama taken during about two weeks ago in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\">Oregon</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.",
