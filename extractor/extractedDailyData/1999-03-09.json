  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/projects/vlti/\">Very Large Telescope (VLT) Interferometric Array</a> will be able to act as \nindividual telescopes or as one huge telescope.\n\nOf the four planned VLTs in \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/paranal/\">Chile</a>, \ntwo have now reached completion.  The \n<a href=\"ap981009.html\">first VLT</a> \nto operate is visible on the left of the <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/info-events/ut1fl/pr-pictures/ut1fl-set1.html\">above photograph</a> and was \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/pr-06-99.html\">recently given the name Antu</a>.  \n\nTo its right is Kueyen, \nwhich achieved its first observations just last week.  Each \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/info-events/ut1fl/whitebook/\">VLT telescope</a> by itself is now one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/bigeyes.html\">largest optical telescopes</a> in the world, \njoining the new cadre of large telescopes with \nmirrors greater than 8-meters in diameter.\n\nAfter Melipal and Yepun are completed in the next few years, the four \n<a href=\"ap960901.html\">VLTs</a> will be able to <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/info-events/ut1fl/whitebook/wb90.html#ch90\">combine their light</a> \nto achieve the sensitivity of a single 16-meter telescope, \nand the resolution of a single 200-meter telescope.\n\nOver the next few years, the VLT telescopes will \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/projects/vlti/science/index.html\">explore the universe</a> in unprecedented detail, \nsearching for everything from <a href=\"http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~gmarcy/planetsearch/planetsearch.html\">ordinary planets orbiting nearby stars</a> to \n<a href=\"ap981230.html\">extraordinary explosions in the \ndistant universe</a>.",
