  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.volcanolive.com/etna.html\">Mt. Etna</a> has been erupting for hundreds of thousands of years.  \n\nIn late October of last year, however, \n<a href=\"http://mapserver2.esri.com/cgi-bin/eq?s=1&amp;cd=f\">earthquakes</a> triggered a particularly vigorous outburst from this \nwell known volcano on the\n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/it.html\">Italian</a> island of Sicily. \n\nLocal schools were closed and \n<a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/department/classes/ge404/gcmayber/\">air-traffic re-routed</a> as \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hawaii/rhodes2.html\">hot lava</a> poured out and \n<a href=\"http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/ash.html\">ash</a> spewed out and settled as far away as \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ly.html\">Libya</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-5/html/iss005e19016.html\">Pictured above</a> was the \n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/img_etna.html\">Mt. Etna</a> ash plume as it appeared to astronauts on the \n<a href=\"ap021208.html\">International Space Station</a>.  \n\nThe view looks toward the southeast.\n\nLight colored \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-5/html/iss005e19024.html\">smoke</a> is due to \n<a href=\"ap001121.html\">forest fires</a> caused by \n<a href=\"http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/Lava/lavaflow.html\">lava</a> on the \n<a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/\">volcano</a>'s north face.",
