  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would Mars appear to move backwards?  \n\nMost of the time, the apparent motion of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a> in\n<a href=\"ap010827.html\">Earth's sky</a> is in one direction,\nslow but steady in front of the far distant stars.\n\nAbout every two years, however, the\n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">Earth passes Mars</a>\nas they orbit around the Sun.  \n\nDuring the most recent such pass starting late last year,\n<a href=\"ap030828.html\">Mars</a> as usual, loomed\n<a href=\"ap030827.html\">large and bright</a>.  \n\nAlso during this time, Mars appeared to move backwards in the sky,\na phenomenon called\n<a href=\"http://alpha.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/retrograd.html\">retrograde motion</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3004740\">Featured here</a> is a series of images digitally stacked\nso that all of the stars coincide.  \n\nHere, Mars appears to\n<a href=\"http://twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3004739\">trace out a narrow loop</a> in the sky.  \n\nAt the center of the loop, Earth passed Mars and the\n<a href=\"ap080511.html\">retrograde motion</a> was the highest.  \n\n<a href=\"ap060422.html\">Retrograde motion</a> can also be seen for other\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/\">Solar System</a> planets.",
