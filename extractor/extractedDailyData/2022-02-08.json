  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhich half of this sky is your favorite?\n\nOn the left, the night sky is lit up by particles expelled from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> that later collided with \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/mos-upper-atmosphere.html\">Earth's upper atmosphere</a> — creating bright auroras. \n\nOn the right, the night glows with ground lights reflected by millions of tiny \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystals\">ice crystals</a> \nfalling from the sky — creating  \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/lpil.htm\">light pillars</a>. \n\nAnd in the center, the astrophotographer presents your choices.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap160208.html\">light pillars</a> \nare vertical columns because the fluttering ice-crystals are \n<a href=\"https://ap-pics2.gotpoem.com/ap-pics/item/14788/92.jpg\">mostly flat</a> to the ground, and their colors are those of the ground lights.\n\nThe auroras cover the sky and ground in the \n<a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/4D.html\">green</a> hue of glowing oxygen, \nwhile their transparency is clear because you can see stars right through them.\n\nDistant stars dot the background, \nincluding bright stars from the iconic constellation of \n<a href=\"ap220118.html\">Orion</a>. \n\nThe featured image was captured in a single exposure two months ago near \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/YJu_aUHeVL4\">Kautokeino</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a>.",
