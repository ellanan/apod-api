  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOnly a <a href=\"ap000616.html\">few short years ago</a>, when the\n<a href=\"ap960616.html\">APOD editors</a> were in graduate school,\nthe pervasive,\n<a href=\"http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~rlentz/astro201/mystery.html\">cosmic\nDark Energy</a> was not even seriously discussed.\n\nOf course, it now\n<a href=\"ap011231.html\">appears</a> that this strange energy dominates\nthe cosmos (as well as lectures\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">on\ncosmology</a>) and provides a\nrepulsive force accelerating the large scale\n<a href=\"http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/IUP/\nBig_Bang_Primer.html\">expansion of the Universe</a>.\n\nIn fact, recent\n<a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402512\">brightness\nmeasurements</a> of distant and\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2001/09/\nastrofile/\">therefore ancient</a>, stellar explosions or supernovae\nindicate that the universal expansion began to\nspeed up in earnest four to six billion years ago,\nwhen the Dark Energy's repulsive force began to\novercome the attractive force of gravity over cosmic distances.\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n2004/12/\">Hubble Space telescope</a> images above show a sample of the\ndistant supernova explosions, billions of light-years away, in before\n(top) and after (bottom) pictures of their faint host galaxies.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0308185\">Hubble\nmeasured</a> supernovae also hint that the\n<a href=\"http://supernova.lbl.gov/~evlinder/sci.html\">Dark Energy's</a>\nrepulsive force is constant over cosmic time and so could be\nconsistent with <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/\narchive/releases/2001/09/astrofile/#2\">Einstein's</a>\noriginal theory of gravitation.\n\nIf the force actually changes with time, the Universe\ncould still end in a\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/\nCosmosFate.html\">Big Crunch</a> or a\n<a href=\"ap030303.html\">Big Rip</a> ... but not for at least an\nestimated 30 billion years.",
