  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is that unusual object?  \n\nAstronomers can identify most objects that are imaged on the sky, but not all.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20011108.afterglow.html\">Pictured above</a> is one that currently defies classification.  \n\nAttributes of the object include that it has unusual \n<a href=\"http://skyserver.fnal.gov/en/proj/advanced/colors/whatis.asp\">colors</a>, appears to be \n<a href=\"ap970422.html\">fading</a> as months go by, \nand appears to be associated with a \n<a href=\"ap970731.html\">distant galaxy</a>.  \n\nIts discoverers hold hope that they have \nuncovered the first known \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001ApJ...557..943R\">orphan afterglow</a>, an explosion that would \nhave been classified as a \n<a href=\"ap001019.html\">gamma-ray burst</a> if the \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/gamma.html\">gamma-rays</a> were beamed in our direction.  \n\nOrphan <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001AAS...198.3501P\">afterglows</a>, if they exist, could have unparalleled brightness, \nand hence be visible so far away that they \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997hgrb.conf.TH05N\">yield key information</a> \nabout the early years of our \n<a href=\"ap010418.html\">universe</a>.\n\nA bit of \n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v33n2/aas198/690.htm\">caution</a> might be merited, however, as the \n<a href=\"ap990928.html\">last well-publicized mystery object</a> \nturned out not to be a new member of the \n<a href=\"http://webs.wichita.edu/lapo/az.htm\">astronomical zoo</a>, \nbut rather an unusual type of <a href=\"http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_7/notes32.html\">quasar</a>.  \n\nFollow-up \n<a href=\"ap980617.html\">observations</a> and \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0111054\">analysis</a> over the next year may find more objects \nlike this and/or solve this mystery.",
