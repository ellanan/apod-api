  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLike a <a href=\"http://www.mesc.usgs.gov/butterfly/Butterfly.html\">butterfly</a>, a <a href=\"ap000910.html\">white dwarf star</a> begins its life\nby casting off a cocoon that enclosed its former self.  \n\nIn this analogy, however, the <a href=\"ap980830.html\">Sun</a> would be a <a href=\"http://www.basecamp.com/example_caterpillar.html\">caterpillar</a> and the ejected shell of gas \nwould become the prettiest of all!\n\nThe above cocoon, the <a href=\"planetary_nebulae.html\">planetary nebula</a> designated NGC 2440, \n<a href=\"ap951130.html\">contains one of the hottest \nwhite dwarf stars known</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/database/Physics/Stars/p01158c.html\">white dwarf</a> can be seen as the bright dot near the \nphoto's center.  \n\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/interv.html\">Our Sun will eventually become a \"white dwarf butterfly\"</a>,\nbut not for another 5 billion years.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://presto.stsci.edu/apsb/doc/pep/public-proposals/6119.pro\">above false color image</a> and was post-processed by <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/commonpages/heritagebios.html#forrest\">Forrest Hamilton</a>.",
