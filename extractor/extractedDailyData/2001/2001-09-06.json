  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHere's something you don't see too often ... a detailed picture of the\nfull Moon surrounded by a rich field of background stars. \n\nIt's true that bright moonlight scattered by the atmosphere tends to\nmask faint stars, but pictures of the\n<a href=\"http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.html\">sunlit portion</a>\nof the Moon made\nwith <a href=\"ap010428.html\">earthbound</a> telescopes\nor even with cameras on the\n<a href=\"ap001209.html\">lunar surface</a> often \nfail to show any background\n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/\nfoxapollo.html#stars\">stars at all</a>.\n\nWhy? Because the exposure times are too short.\n\nVery short exposures, lasting fractions of a second, are required to\naccurately\n<a href=\"http://www.u-net.com/ph/mas/observe/lunar-p/lunar-p.htm\">record\nan image</a> of the bright lunar surface.\n\nBut the background stars (and galaxies!) such as those visible above\nare much fainter and need exposures lasting minutes to hours which\nwould seriously <a href=\"ap010209.html\">overexpose</a>\nthe surface of the Moon.\n\nSo, of course <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/\nim0650.html\">this stunning view</a>\nreally is a combination of two digital images --\na short exposure, registering the exquisite lunar\nsurface details\n<a href=\"ap010809.html\">at full Moon</a>, superposed on\na separate very long exposure, made with\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/\nluna.html\">the Moon</a> absent from the star field.\n\nThe final representation\n<a href=\"http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/pubserv/hos/moon/frontisp.htm\">of\nMoon</a> and background stars is very\ndramatic, even though it could not have been captured in a single\nexposure.",
