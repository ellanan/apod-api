  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nStars like HD 82943 are <a href=\"ap010223.html\">main\nsequence</a> G dwarf stars with\ntemperatures and compositions similar\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/sun/composition.html\">to\nthe Sun</a>.\n\nAlso like the Sun, HD 82943 is\n<a href=\"http://www.generation.net/~mariob/astro/exoplan/\nintro-e.htm\">known to have</a> at least\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/\npr-07-01.html\">two giant planets</a>,\nbut unlike gas giants in our solar system\ntheir orbits are not nearly circular and bring them closer to the\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/planets/catalog.html\">parent star</a>.\n\nAstronomers now point to strong observational\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/\npr-10-01.html\">evidence that HD 82943</a>\nused to have more planets ... but swallowed them in the past.\n\nSuch a cosmic cataclysm is illustrated above in an artist's\n<a href=\"http://www.jtwinc.com/Extrasolar/\">dramatic</a> vision.\n\nAs a result, planetary debris would contaminate the outer\nlayers of HD 82943.\n\nResearchers using a\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/instruments/\nuves/\">high resolution spectrograph</a> at the\nEuropean Southern Observatory's\n<a href=\"ap000707.html\">Kueyen telescope</a> believe they have\nseen a <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/\npr-10-01.html#phot-17-01\">clear signature</a> of this contamination by\nidentifying the isotope\n<a href=\"http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Li/\nisot.html\">Lithium-6</a> in this\n<a href=\"ap000815.html\">sun-like star's spectrum</a>.\n\nBecause the light element Lithium-6 is so readily destroyed\nin nuclear reactions during star formation, no significant Lithium-6\nshould now exist in <a href=\"http://www.jtwinc.com/Extrasolar/\nstar.asp?StarID=113\">HD 82943</a>.\n\nStartlingly, perhaps the most likely explanation for the presence of\nLithium-6 today is that it is left over from planetary material which\nformed separately and was then absorbed by the parent star.",
