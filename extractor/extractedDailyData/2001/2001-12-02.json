  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThree years ago \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AAS...193.3904A\">results</a> were \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R\">first presented</a> indicating that \nmost of the energy in our universe is not in \nstars or galaxies but is tied to space itself.  \n\nIn the language of cosmologists, a large \n<a href=\"http://super.colorado.edu/~michaele/lambda.html\">cosmological constant</a> is directly implied by new distant \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/supernovae.html\">supernovae</a> observations.  \n\nSuggestions of a \n<a href=\"http://pancake.uchicago.edu/~carroll/encyc/\">cosmological constant</a> (lambda) are \n<a href=\"http://cc.oulu.fi/~rdummler/Abstracts/moco.lambda.htm\">not new</a> -- they have existed since the advent of \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm\">modern relativistic cosmology</a>. \n\nSuch claims are \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/1297issue/1297yam.html\">not usually popular</a> with astronomers, though, because lambda is so unlike known universe components, because \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...466..638K\">lambda's value appears limited by other observations</a>, \nand because less-strange cosmologies without lambda have \npreviously done well in explaining the data. \n\n\nWhat is noteworthy here is the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations and the good reputations of the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/Research/supernova/highz/names.html\">scientists conducting</a> \n<a href=\"http://panisse.lbl.gov/public/\">the investigations</a>. \n\nOver the past three years, two independent \nteams of astronomers have continued to accumulate data \nthat appears to confirm the unsettling result. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/Research/supernova/highz/figures/pictures.html\">above picture</a> of a supernova that occurred in \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AGM....14..P95D\">1994</a> \non the outskirts of a \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nwas taken by one of these collaborations.  \n\nStill, \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aliens/carlsagan.html\">extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</a>, \nand so cosmologists the world over continue to await \nmore data and confirmation by independent methods.",
