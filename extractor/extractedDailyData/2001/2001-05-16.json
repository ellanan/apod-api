  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAre black holes the cause of X-rays that pour out \nfrom the center of the \n<a href=\"ap001204.html\">Circinus galaxy</a>?  \n\n\nA new high-resolution image from the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> has resolved the \ninner regions of this nearby galaxy into \nseveral smaller sources.  \n\nThe image is <a href=\"http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/news/releases/2001/01-171.html\">shown above</a> in representative-color.  \n\nExtended \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/chandra1012.html\">X-ray</a> emission from the center appears to \nmatch optical light and appears consistent \nwith a model where hot gas is escaping from a \n<a href=\"ap960824.html\">supermassive black hole</a> at \n<a href=\"http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/bkoribal/circinus/circinus.html\">Circinus' center</a>.  \n\nAt least one of the other sources varies \nits X-ray brightness as expected from a \n<a href=\"binary_stars.html\">binary star system</a>, \nindicating that the system is small yet massive, \nand giving credence to a model where a \n<a href=\"black_holes.html\">black hole</a> \nis surrounded by doughnut-shaped ring.  \n\nThe region shown spans about 5000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> across.",
