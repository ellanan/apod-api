  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nScientists are melting holes in the bottom of the world. \nIn fact, several holes have been melted near the \n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/cara/vtour/pole/\">South Pole</a>, and they are now being \nused as astronomical observatories.  \n<a href=\"http://amanda.berkeley.edu/amanda/printcollaboration.cgi\">Astronomers</a> with the <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/1299engineering/1299musserbox7.html\">Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array</a> (AMANDA) \nlower into each vertical lake a string knotted with \nbasketball-sized light detectors.  \n\nThe water in each hole soon refreezes.  \n\nThe detectors are sensitive to blue light emitted \nin the surrounding clear ice. Such light is expected \nfrom ice collisions with high-energy \n<a href=\"ap980605.html\">neutrinos</a> emitted by \nobjects or explosions out in the universe.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://alizarin.physics.wisc.edu/jacobsen/amanda/down_the_hole/\">above picture</a> was taken 750 meters below the surface \nlooking down into the \n<a href=\"http://amanda.berkeley.edu/amanda/ice-fishing.html\">abyss</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://amanda.berkeley.edu/amanda/amanda-schematics.html\">Instruments</a> were lowered down past 2000 meters. \n\nData from AMANDA is currently being \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0009242\">collected</a> and \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0008255\">analyzed</a>.",
