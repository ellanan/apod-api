  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhen NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by\ndistant Neptune in August of 1989,\n<a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/vgrnep_fs.html\">astronomers\nwere</a> shocked.\n\nSince <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/\nphotogallery-neptune.html\">Neptune</a> receives only 3 percent\nthe sunlight Jupiter does, they\nexpected to find a dormant, dark, frigid planet.\n\nInstead, the <a href=\"http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/\nAtlas/Voyager/Neptune/by-description/\">Voyager images</a> revealed\nevidence of <a href=\"ap010821.html\">a dynamic</a> and turbulent world.\n\nOne of the most spectacular discoveries was of <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/\ndarkspot.txt\">the Great Dark Spot</a>, shown here in close-up.\n\nSurprisingly, it was\ncomparable in size and at the same relative southern latitude as <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/aug5/displayjupgrs.html\">Jupiter's\nGreat Red Spot</a>, appearing to be a\nsimilar rotating storm system.\n\nWinds near the spot were measured up to\n1500 miles per hour, the strongest recorded on any planet.\n\nThe Voyager data also revealed that the Great\nDark Spot varied significantly in size during the brief flyby.\n\nWhen the <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/09.html\">Hubble\nSpace Telescope viewed</a> the planet in 1994, <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/Neptune.txt\">the spot had\nvanished</a> -- only to be replaced by <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/NeptDS.txt\">another dark\nspot</a> in the planet's northern hemisphere!",
