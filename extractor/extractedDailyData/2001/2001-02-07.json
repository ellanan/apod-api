  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nBright blue stars highlight the open cluster known as \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m103.html\">M103</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"ap000924.html\">gas clouds</a> \nfrom which these stars condensed has long dispersed.  \n\nOf the stars that were formed, the \nbrightest, bluest, and most massive have already <a href=\"http://observe.ivv.nasa.gov/nasa/space/stellardeath/stellardeath_intro.html\">used up their nuclear fuel</a> and self-destructed in \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova explosions</a>.  \n\nA 20 million-year age for M103 was \nestimated by finding the brightest \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec15.html\">main-sequence stars</a> \nthat still survive and theoretically computing their lifetimes.  \n\nIn fact, a formerly blue star has recently \nevolved off the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/msblues.html\">main sequence</a> and is \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0635.html\">visible above</a> as the \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec17.html\">red giant star</a> near the cluster center. \n\nIn general, yellow stars like our \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> are usually less \nbright and hence less prominent in \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open clusters</a> \nthan their massive blue cousins.  \n\nLight takes about 14 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">years</a> to cross \n<a href=\"http://www.e-z.net/~haworth/messier/m103.html\">M103</a>.  \n\nAlthough visible with binoculars toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Const/constS.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/cas.html\">Cassiopeia</a>, \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999A%26A...349..448S\">M103</a>'s great distance of 8000 light years \nmakes it appear four times smaller than a \n<a href=\"ap000113.html\">full moon</a>.",
