  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nYesterday NEAR-Shoemaker became the \n<a href=\"http://near-mirror.boulder.swri.edu/news/flash/01feb12_6.html\">first spacecraft to land on an asteroid</a> \nand send signals back from its surface.  \n\nSince the \n<a href=\"http://near-mirror.boulder.swri.edu/spacecraft/\">robot spacecraft</a> was not designed for such a \n<a href=\"ap010212.html\">contingency</a>, \nthe success of the landing on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>\n<a href=\"http://near-mirror.boulder.swri.edu/eros/sum.html\">433 Eros</a> was not assured.  \n\n<a href=\"http://near-mirror.boulder.swri.edu/iod/20010212f/\">Shown above</a> is the last picture taken by \nNEAR-Shoemaker before its touchdown.  \n\nThe streaking on the lower part of the image \nwas caused by the loss of \n<a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=telemetry\">telemetry</a> as the satellite impacted the \n\n<a href=\"ap010206.html\">surface</a>.  \n\nThe image was taken 130 meters above the surface and \nspans 6 meters across.  \n\nRocks as small as a human hand are visible.  \n\nAs engineers \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceflightnow.com/near/status.html\">continue</a> to try to communicate \nwith the beached car-sized spacecraft, \nscientists will work to understand features visible in the \n<a href=\"http://near-mirror.boulder.swri.edu/iod/archive.html\">highest resolution photographs</a> ever taken of an asteroid.",
