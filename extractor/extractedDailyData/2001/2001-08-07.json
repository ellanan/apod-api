  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThose up before dawn in late July in the \nnorthern hemisphere could \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/sights.shtml\">see planets, stars</a>, and a spacecraft in a \nsingle quick glance before starting their day.  \n\nNear the eastern horizon was bright \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>, and not far above and to its right was the very bright \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/venus.htm\">Venus</a>.  \n\nConnecting the dots will point you just right of \n<a href=\"saturn.html\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nFar in the distance but near the top right of the frame \nis the <a href=\"ap010506.html\">Pleiades</a> star cluster.  \n\nOrbiting the \n<a href=\"ap001127.html\">Earth</a> well in the foreground, the \n<a href=\"ap010509.html\">International Space Station</a> \nreflected sunlight to cause the faint line segment.  \n\nIn the very close foreground, the bright red and yellow lines \nwere caused by a passing van.  \n\nThe above picture was taken on July 26 from \n<a href=\"http://www.gouv.qc.ca/\">Quebec</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ca.html\">Canada</a>.  \n\nWhy are bushes \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/northern/0107skyn.shtml\">visible</a> through the van?  \n\nThe van was present for only a few of the \n25 seconds of the total exposure.",
