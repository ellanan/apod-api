  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening at the center of spiral galaxy M83?  \n\nJust about everything, from the looks of it.  \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m083.html\">M83</a>, visible in the inset image on the upper left, \nis one of the closest \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxies</a> to our own \n<a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_milky.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> and from a distance of 15 million \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/lightspeed.html\">light-years</a>, appears to be relatively normal.  \n\nZooming in on \n<a href=\"ap991206.html\">M83</a>'s nucleus with the \nlatest telescopes, however, shows the center \nto be an energetic and busy place.  \n\nVisible in the <a href=\"http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~rs1/M83.html\">above image</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nare bright, \n<a href=\"ap000924.html\">newly formed stars</a> and giant \n<a href=\"ap990919.html\">lanes</a> of dark \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a>.  \n\nAn \n<a href=\"http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~rs1/M83.html\">image with similar perspective</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> \nshows the region is also rich in very hot gas and \n<a href=\"ap010910.html\">small</a> bright sources.  \n\nObservations with the large ground-based \n<a href=\"ap000707.html\">VLT telescopes</a> show the very \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26A...364L..47T\">center likely has two separate nuclei</a>.",
