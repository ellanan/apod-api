  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did large rocks come to be scattered \non the surface of asteroid Eros?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v413/n6854/full/413369a0_fs.html\">Eros</a> stands out not only because of its \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/asteroids/collisions.html\">proximity to Earth</a> but also\nbecause it was visited recently by \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://discovery.nasa.gov/near.html\">NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft</a>.  \n\nAfter arriving at \n<a href=\"http://www.spacescience.com/headlines/y2000/ast19feb_1.htm\">Eros</a> in 2000 February, the robot probe was \n<a href=\"ap010824.html\">maneuvered to a controlled landing</a> earlier this year.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/ed/index.html\">NEAR-Shoemaker</a> is no longer active, \nscientists are still poring over the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/v7_2.html\">images</a> and data, \nfinding new mysteries, and drawing new hypotheses \nabout the ancient tumbling space mountain.\n\nFor example, analyzing the locations of rocks has led to the \n<a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Sept01/Eros.Nature.deb.html\">hypothesis</a> that many of them originated \nin a single large collision that occurred \npossibly about a billion years ago.  \n\nStill unknown, however, includes why Eros has \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nsu/010927/010927-10.html\">unusual ponds</a> of blue dust.",
