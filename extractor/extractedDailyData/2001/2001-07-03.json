  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is causing the unusual flashes behind globular cluster M22?  \n\nThis teeming ball of stars is the brightest \n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular cluster</a> \nvisible from Earth's northern hemisphere.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m022.html\">M22</a>, shown in full in the inset, spans about 50 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> and lies 8,500 light-years away toward the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/sgr.html\">Sagittarius</a>.  \n\nM22's center was \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/2001/20/index.html\">recently imaged repeatedly</a> by the high resolution \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  \n\nBehind <a href=\"http://www.mt.net.au/~southsky/astronomy/m22.html\">M22</a> are many more stars near the \n<a href=\"ap000705.html\">center of our Galaxy</a>.  \n\nUnexpectedly, several stars \n<a href=\"ap990911.html\">near the Galactic center</a> \n-- well behind \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0575.html\">M22</a> -- appeared to nearly double in \nbrightness and return to normal within 20 hours.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/links/010628/010628-5.html\">One hypothesis</a> posed to explain these quick brightness changes is the \n<a href=\"http://www.iam.ubc.ca/~newbury/lenses/research.html\">gravitational lens effect</a> \nof large planets roaming freely in the cluster.  \n\n\nOne problem with this is that no such\n<a href=\"http://exoplanets.org/index.html\">planetary population</a> was previously known!  \n\nFuture observations are planned to better \nunderstand these mysterious flashes.",
