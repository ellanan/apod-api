  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOne of the largest spheres in \n<a href=\"milky_way.html\">our Galaxy</a> \nis giving valuable clues about the chemical composition \nof stars by its very shape.  \n\n<a href=\"planetary_nebulae.html\">Planetary nebula</a> <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0636.html\">Abell 39</a>, now six light-years across, was once \na sun-like star's outer atmosphere expelled thousands of years ago.  \n\nThe nearly perfect \n<a href=\"http://math.rice.edu/~pcmi/sphere/\">spherical</a> nature of \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr01/pr0102.html\">Abell 39</a> allows astronomers to accurately \nestimate how much relative material is actually \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/absorption.html\">absorbing</a> and emitting light.  \n\nObservations indicate that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000AAS...197.0616J\">Abell 39</a> \ncontains only about half of the \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/8.html\">oxygen</a> found in the \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a>, \nan intriguing but not surprising confirmation of the \nchemical differences between stars.  \n\nThe reason why the central star is slightly off center by 0.1 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> is currently unknown.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrsp-mrs.fr/private/nebulae/a39.html\">Abell 39</a> lies about 7000 light years away, although several \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">galaxies</a> \nmillions of light years away can be seen through \nand around the nebula.",
