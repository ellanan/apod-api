  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<i>Q:</i> Why are\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/\nblack_holes.html\">black holes</a> black?\n\n<i>A:</i> Because they have an\n<a href=\"http://www.anu.edu.au/physics/courses/A07/student/blackhole99/\nblack.htm#schwarzchild\">event horizon</a>.\n\nThe event horizon is that one-way boundary predicted by\n<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/NumRelHome.html\">general\nrelativity</a> beyond which nothing, not even light, can return.\n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ep/pressrel/garcia01.html\">X-ray\nastronomers</a> using the space-based Chandra Observatory now\nbelieve they have direct evidence for event horizons - therefore\nblack holes - in binary star systems which can be \ndetected in x-ray light.\n\nThese binaries, sometimes called x-ray novae, are\nknown to consist of relatively normal stars dumping\nmaterial on to massive, compact companions.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/blackholes/\nindex.html\">As illustrated</a>,\nthe material swirls toward the companion in an\n<a href=\"ap991219.html\">accretion disk</a> which itself glows in x-rays.\n\nIf the compact companion is a <a href=\"ap001215.html\">neutron star</a>\n(right), the material ultimately smashes into the solid surface\nand glows even more brightly in high energy x-rays.\n\nBut if it is indeed a\n<a href=\"ap001210.html\">black hole</a> with a defining event\nhorizon, then the x-ray hot material approaches the speed of\nlight as it swirls past the surface of no\nreturn and is lost from view.\n\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0012452\">Recent\nwork describes</a> observations of two classes of\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/binary.html\">x-ray binaries</a>,\none class 100 times fainter than the other.\n\nThe results imply the presence of an event horizon in the\nfainter class which causes the extreme difference in x-ray\nbrightness.",
