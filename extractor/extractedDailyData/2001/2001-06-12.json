  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nBy chance, a collision of two galaxies has created \na surprisingly recognizable shape on a cosmic scale. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/hst/Cartwheel.html\">The Cartwheel Galaxy</a> is part of a \n<a href=\"ap990906.html\">group of galaxies</a> \nabout 500 million light years away in the \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/astro/asp/constellation.faq.html\">constellation</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/scl.html\">Sculptor</a>.   \n\nTwo smaller galaxies in the group are visible \non the left of the \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aatccd002.html\">above photograph</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-\nbib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...467..241H\">The Cartwheel's rim</a> is an immense ring-like structure 100,000 \n<a href=\"http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/012292.html\">light years</a> in diameter composed of \nnewly formed, extremely bright, massive stars. \n\n<a href=\"ap951228.html\">When galaxies collide</a>, \nthey pass through each other -- \ntheir individual stars rarely come into contact.  \n\nThe galaxies' gravitational fields, however, may be greatly \n<a href=\"ap001102.html\">distorted by the collision</a>. \n\nIn fact, the \n<a href=\"ap980615.html\">ring-like shape</a> \nis the result of the gravitational disruption \ncaused by a small intruder galaxy passing \nthrough a large one, <a href=\"ap961128.html\">compressing</a> \nthe interstellar gas and dust, and causing a \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/astronomy/astronomy17.html\">wave of star formation</a> wave to move out from \nthe impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond. \n\nIn this case, the large galaxy may have originally been a \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral</a>, not unlike our own \n<a href=\"milky_way.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, \ntransformed by the collision.  \n\nRecent astronomical detective work has indicated \n<a href=\"ap970224.html\">what has become of the intruder</a>.",
