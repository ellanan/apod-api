  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOn the frozen ice near the bottom of our world, \nincreasingly sophisticated instruments listen for a \nmore precise echo of how our universe started.  \n\nSunday, independent collaborations behind three such instruments \n<a href=\"http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/01/dasi/010427.dasi.shtml\">announced evidence</a> that overtones heard are consistent with our universe having only about five percent normal matter and 95 percent \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/0398cosmos/0398rubin.html\">dark matter</a> or <a href=\"ap010404.html\">dark energy</a>.  \n\nThis amount of normal matter was expected were \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">our universe</a> to have undergone a particularly \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9704062\">explosive early phase</a> of the big bang known as \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/cosmology/inflation.html\">inflation</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0104490\">measurements</a> were actually made on the \nangular scale of 1/10th degree by detecting slight fluctuations of \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/micro.html\">microwave light</a> that occur in \n<a href=\"ap001029.html\">cosmic background</a> radiation.  \n\nThese \n<a href=\"ap001230.html\">fluctuations</a> are thought \nto be caused by sound waves moving through the early universe.\n\n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/cara/vtour/pole/darksector/cmbr/\">Pictured above</a> is the remote receiver for the \n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/dasi/\">Degree Angular Scale Interferometer</a> \n(DASI) that recorded one of the data sets.  \n\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0104459\">Similar</a> \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0104460\">results</a> were reported Sunday by the \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~boomerang/\">BOOMERANG</a> and \n<a href=\"http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/group/cmb/maximapeople.html\">MAXIMA</a> collaborations.",
