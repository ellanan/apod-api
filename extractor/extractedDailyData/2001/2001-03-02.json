  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nYou'd need a really big cup of\n<a href=\"http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~gekko/\ndoughnut.html\">coffee with this doughnut</a> ...\nbecause the hole in the middle is about a billion kilometers\nacross.\n\nCentered on the Sun, a circle that size would lie\nbetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\n\nIn fact, this doughnut is known to surround a massive newborn star\ncataloged as LkHa 101\nwhich lies in the\n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/perseus/\nconstell.html\">constellation Perseus</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/newtop/whatsnew.html\">Imaged\nin infrared light</a>, the tantalizing torus-shaped cloud of gas\n<a href=\"http://stardust.wustl.edu/IDPIntro.html\">and dust</a>\nis slightly tilted to our view.\n\nThe cloud's material may well be the ingredients\nfor the formation of a\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceart.org/lcook/extrasol.html\">distant\nsolar system</a>.\n\nA bright source of\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nmultiwavelength.html\">ultraviolet light</a>,\nthe hot young star itself is much fainter in the\ninfrared and so not visible in this picture.\n\nStill, the star's presence is indicated as its intense stellar wind and\nradiation has apparently carved out the doughnut's hole.\n\nThis premier close-up of a stellar system in formation was accomplished\nby adapting a powerful observational technique\n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/2001/0301issue/0301armstrong.html\">called\ninterferometry</a> to planet Earth's largest single mirror\ntelescope, the <a href=\"http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu:3636/\">10 meter Keck</a>.",
