The center of <a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon/Apollo17/\nA17_Photography_metric.html#Copernicus\">Copernicus</a> is about 93 kilometers across.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon/science/craterstructure.html#Copernicus\">above picture</a> was taken in 1972 by the \nlast human mission to the moon: \n<a href=\"ap001209.html\">Apollo 17</a>.  \n\nThe prospects for a return have been boosted recently with \nincreased evidence of \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html\">ice deposits</a> near the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast13oct99_1.htm\">lunar poles</a>.",
