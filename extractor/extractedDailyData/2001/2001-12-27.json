  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first on\n<a href=\"ap960626.html\">Charles Messier's</a>\nfamous list of things which are not comets.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"ap010602.html\">the Crab is</a>\nnow known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding\ncloud of debris from the explosion of a massive star.\n\nThe violent birth of the Crab was\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m001_sn.html\">witnessed\nby astronomers</a> in the year 1054.\n\nRoughly 10 light-years across today, the nebula is still expanding\nat a rate of over 1,000 kilometers per second.\n\nFlipping between two images made nearly 30 years apart, this\nanimation clearly demonstrates the expansion.\n\nThe smaller Crab was recorded as a\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/\nim0345.html\">photographic image</a> made in 1973\nusing the <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/kpno/\">Kitt Peak</a>\nNational Observatory 4-meter telescope in 1973.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/m1.html\">The\nexpanded Crab</a> was made this year with the Kitt Peak\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/nop/pop.html\">Visitor Center's</a>\n0.4-meter telescope and digital camera.\n\nBackground stars were used to register the two images.",
