  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLast year, a <i>different</i> comet LINEAR <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?LINEAR+S4\">(C/1999 S4)</a> broke up.  \n\nThis year, a comet \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/07500/07564.html\">first imaged</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/\">Lincoln Near Asteroid Research</a> (LINEAR) telescope in \n<a href=\"http://www.state.nm.us/\">New Mexico</a> on \n2001 January 3, is also breaking up.   \n\nThis new Comet LINEAR \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#2001A2\">(C/2001 A2)</a> unexpectedly brightened to the edge of naked-eye\nvisiblilty a few weeks ago when its nucleus broke in two.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/phot-18-01.html\">Observations taken just last week</a> \nnow indicate that one of the two remaining \n<a href=\"http://meteors.com/cometlinear/\">nuclear fragments</a> \nhas again fragmented. \n\nThe first piece to break off is visible on the upper left of the above\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/phot-18-01.html\">false-color image</a> by a \n<a href=\"ap000707.html\">Very Large Telescope</a>, \nwhile additional fragmentation is inferred \nfrom the brightness and elongation of the \nspot on the lower right. \n\nWhen a \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">comet nucleus</a> splits, \nnew surfaces are exposed and previously trapped ice and gas\nare released that evaporate and brighten in the energetic sunlight. \n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/images/01A2/LINEAR-A2-1.gif\">Comet LINEAR</a> may remain visible with little or no optical aid \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/skyevents/0105skyevents.shtml\">into early June</a>.\n\n\nIn contrast, at least two other much dimmer\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1999T2\">Comet</a> \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1999Y1\">LINEARs</a> discovered recently appear stable.",
