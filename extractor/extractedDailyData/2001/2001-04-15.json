  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nUnusual appendages around bright stars are commonplace, \nbut never seem to be mentioned.  What are they?   \n\nFirst, a <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/telescope.html\">telescope</a> brings starlight falling over a <a href=\"http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/a100/handouts/scopes/scopes.html\">large area to a small area</a>.  \n\nTo get at this small area, however, \none must go inside a <a href=\"http://www.sal.wisc.edu/SpacePlace/newton.html\">reflecting telescope</a>, \nand one good way to do this is to use support rods,  \nwhich are right in the view of the \n<a href=\"ap980913.html\">telescope</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.nobel.se/physics/articles/ekspong/\">wave nature of light</a> causes it to \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction.html\">deflect</a> when passing near these rods.  \n\nLight scatters away from the original destination \npoint ending up elsewhere and appearing as \n\"<a href=\"http://www.chapman.edu/oca/gallery2/artifact.htm\">diffraction spikes</a>.\"   \n\nThese annoying spikes steal precious light \nfrom the central image and hide light from fainter, more interesting stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.tls-tautenburg.de/research/M8.html\">Above</a>, astronomers are more interested in the \nhalf-circled point near the image center, than the cool-looking \ndiffraction spikes from the bright star at the bottom. \n\nApparently, that \n<a href=\"http://www.tls-tautenburg.de/research/M8.html\">half-circle \nis a new stellar system forming</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap010103.html\">Lagoon Nebula</a>.",
