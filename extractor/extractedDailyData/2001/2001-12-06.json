  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA comet bright enough to be seen with binoculars \nis swooping into southern skies. \n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2000wm1.html\">Comet C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR)</a> continues to brighten and develop \n<a href=\"ap001227.html\">tails</a> as it nears its \nclosest approach of the Sun in late January 2002.  \n\n<a href=\"ap000727.html\">Comet LINEAR</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.ss.astro.umd.edu/IAU/csbn/cnames.shtml\">WM1</a> was discovered over a year ago when it was out past \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> and still very faint.  \n\nIn the above picture from the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0131.html\">Curtis Schmidt 0.6-meter Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ci.html\">Chile</a>, a 30-second exposure in red on December 4 \ncaptured detail in Comet \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/\">LINEAR</a> WM1's emerging \n<a href=\"ap970403.html\">dust tail</a>.\n\n\nOptimistic sky watchers hope that \n<a href=\"http://gdrayer.tripod.com/WM1/index.htm\">Comet LINEAR WM1</a> will \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2000WM1_1.html\">undergo</a> an even greater (and unexpected) brightening \nto the point where its \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/comet.htm\">coma and tails</a> are easily discernable to the unaided eye.  \n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/images/00WM1/WM1-finder2.gif\">Comet LINEAR WM1</a> is being watched with \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/request.html\">particular interest</a> by astronomers because its \n<a href=\"ap970514.html\">ion tail</a> might yield clues \nto understanding the \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">solar wind</a> expelled from near the Sun's poles.",
