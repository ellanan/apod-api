  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/a1060.html\">Hydra Cluster of Galaxies</a> contains well over \n100 bright galaxies - but perhaps fewer \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/galaxy.html\">galaxies</a> than \nmight be expected from its mass. \n\n<a href=\"clusters_of_galaxies.html\">Clusters of galaxies</a> \nare the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe.  \n\nMost of a \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/ginfo6.html\">cluster's mass</a>, however, appears to be in a form \n<a href=\"ap960419.html\">too dark to see</a>, as analyses of the \n<a href=\"http://wave.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/calendar/1999/jul\">distribution of X-ray light</a>, \n<a href=\"ap000423.html\">gravitational lensing</a>, \nand internal motions indicate.\n\nAbell 1060, as the \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat116.html\">above cluster</a> is also known, \nappears to have an even higher fraction of \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/0398cosmos/0398rubin.html\">dark matter</a> than seen in a similar cluster, a situation \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...471L..83L\">astronomers cannot easily reconcile</a> \nwith both clusters forming solely from gravitational attraction.  \n\nThe Hydra Cluster of Galaxies, named for its \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/hya.html\">home constellation</a>, spans about ten million <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a>.",
