  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nToday marks the Vernal\n<a href=\"ap960922.html\">Equinox</a>, the first\n<a href=\"http://www.phy.mtu.edu/apod/calendar/allyears.html\">day of</a> Spring for planet Earth's northern hemisphere.\n\nDespite recent attempts by other\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/eclipses/s970309b.html\">spectacular</a> and\n<a href=\"ap970319.html\">dramatic</a>\ncelestial events to take center stage,\n<a href=\"http://www.halebopp.com/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> remains the most popular object in the sky\n(according to <a href=\"ap960616.html\">APOD</a> access logs!)\nand is likely to make this spring memorable for many.\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sunrise.it/associazioni/aac/comete/95o10397.htm\">Gorgeous pictures of the comet</a> with its delightful tails -\nthis one taken March 16 - make this\noutbreak of \"comet fever\" understandable.\n\nWill the Earth pass through\n<a href=\"ap970314.html\">the lovely tails of Hale-Bopp</a>?\n\nNo, but the Earth has made similar journeys in the past.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"ap960327.html\">tales are often told</a>\nof our planet's 1910 passage through comet Halley's tail.\n\nAnticipation of this event caused\nhysteria as it followed close on the heels of the spectroscopic\n<a href=\"http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/bss/HB0315CN.html\">detection of CN</a>, poisonous cyanide, as a gaseous\n<a href=\"ap960326.html\">constituent of cometary tails</a>.\n\nHowever, stretching for millions of miles, awe-inspiring\ncomet tails are actually an extremely tenuous, nearly perfect vacuum\nand don't pose a danger to\n<a href=\"http://superior.carleton.ca/~tpatters/Museum/extinction/\ntablecont.html\">life on Earth</a>.",
