  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow was this unusual looking galaxy created?\n\nNo one is sure, especially since spiral galaxy NGC 7049 looks so strange.  \n\nNGC 7049's striking appearance is primarily due to an unusually prominent \n<a href=\"ap060115.html\">dust ring</a> seen mostly in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette\">silhouette</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap070121.html\">opaque ring</a> is much \n<a href=\"ap020408.html\">darker than the din</a> of millions of bright stars glowing behind it.\n\nBesides the dark dust, NGC 7049 appears similar to a smooth \n<a href=\"ap040616.html\">elliptical galaxy</a>, \nalthough featuring surprisingly few \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\">globular \nstar clusters</a>.\n\nNGC 7049 is <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0905.html\">pictured above</a> as imaged recently by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nThe bright star near the top of \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/html/heic0905a.html\">NGC 7049</a> is an unrelated foreground star in our own Galaxy.  \n\nNot visible here is an unusual central \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar-ring_galaxy\">polar ring</a> \nof gas circling out of the plane near the galaxy's center.\n\nSince <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...636...90H\">NGC 7049</a> is the brightest galaxy in its \n<a href=\"ap080520.html\">cluster of galaxies</a>, \nits formation might be fostered by several prominent and recent \n<a href=\"ap061024.html\">galaxy collisions</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...465..777C\">NGC 7049</a> spans about 150 thousand light years and lies about 100 million \n<a href=\"http://www.physlink.com/Education/askExperts/ae502.cfm\">light years</a> away toward the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_(constellation)\">constellation \nof Indus</a>.",
