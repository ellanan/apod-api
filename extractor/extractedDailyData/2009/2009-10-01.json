  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis cosmic pillar of gas and dust is nearly 2 light-years wide.\n\nThe structure lies within\none of our galaxy's largest star forming regions,\n<a href=\"ap090524.html\">the Carina Nebula</a>,\nshining in\n<a href=\"ap080707.html\">southern skies</a> at a distance of\nabout 7,500 light-years.\n\nThe pillar's convoluted outlines\n<a href=\"ap080313.html\">are shaped</a> by the winds and radiation\nof Carina's young, hot, massive stars.\n\nBut the interior of the cosmic pillar\nitself is home to stars in the process of formation.\n\nIn fact, placing your cursor over this visible light image will\nreveal a penetrating\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\nir_tutorial/irregions.html\">near-infrared</a> view of the pillar -\nnow dominated by two, narrow,\n<a href=\"ap070811.html\">energetic jets</a> blasting outward from a\nstill hidden infant star.\n\nBoth <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/25/\nimage/h/\">visible light and near-infrared images</a>\nwere made using the Hubble Space Telescope's newly installed\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/\ninstruments/wfc3/\">Wide Field Camera 3</a>.",
