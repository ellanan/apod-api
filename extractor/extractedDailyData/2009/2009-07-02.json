  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDubbed a Lyman-alpha blob, an enormous cloud of hydrogen gas spans\nseveral hundred thousand light-years in\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/labs/\">this remarkable\nimage</a> (left), a composite of\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\nmultiwavelength_astronomy/multiwavelength_astronomy/\">x-ray, optical,\nand infrared</a> data\nfrom space and ground based observatories.\n\nThe gigantic, amoeba-like structure is seen as it was when\n<a href=\"ap060323.html\">the universe was</a> a\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html\">mere</a> 2 billion\nyears old (about 12 billion\n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_age.html\">years ago</a>).\n\nLyman-alpha blobs are so called because they strongly emit\nradiation due to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series\">Lyman-alpha emission</a>\nline of hydrogen gas.\n\nNormally, Lyman-alpha emission is in the ultraviolet part of\nthe spectrum, but Lyman-apha blobs are so distant, their light is\nredshifted to (longer) optical\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/\nems1.html\">wavelengths</a>.\n\nX-ray data (blue)\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0452\">indicates</a> the presence of a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nblackholes_sm.html\">supermassive black hole</a>\nfeeding at the center of an active galaxy embedded in the blob.\n\nIllustrated close up in the right hand panel, radiation and outflows\nfrom the active galaxy are thought to be a source for energizing\nand heating the blob's hydrogen gas.\n\nIn fact, Lyman-alpha blobs could represent an early phase in\ngalaxy formation where the heating is so great it begins\nto limit further rapid growth of\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/quasars.html\">active\ngalaxies</a> and their supermassive black holes.",
