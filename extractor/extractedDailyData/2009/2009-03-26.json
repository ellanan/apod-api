  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGalactic or <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/\nopen.html\">open star clusters</a> are relatively young.\n\nThese swarms of stars are born near the plane of the Milky Way,\nbut their numbers steadily dwindle as cluster members are\nstrewn through the Galaxy by gravitational interactions.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m046.html\">This\nbright open cluster, known as M46</a>, is around 300 million years\nyoung and still contains a few hundred stars within its span of\n30 light-years or so.\n\nLocated about 5,000 light-years away toward the\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/pup/index.html\">constellation\nPuppis</a>, M46\nalso seems to contain a contradiction to its youthful status.\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.darkatmospheres.com/astro/gallery/clusters/\nenlarge.php?fileBase=clusters_3\">the lovely starscape</a>,\nthe colorful, circular patch just below the center of M46\n(also inset at upper left) is the planetary nebula NGC 2438.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are a brief,\nfinal phase in the life of a solar-type star a few\n<a href=\"http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp\">billion</a>\nyears old whose central reservoir of hydrogen\nfuel has been exhausted.\n\nIn fact, old\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n2438.html\">NGC 2438</a>\nis estimated to be only 3,000 light-years distant and\nmoves at a different speed than M46 cluster members.\n\nIt likely represents a foreground object,\n<a href=\"ap090122.html\">only by chance</a> appearing\nalong our line-of-sight to young M46.",
