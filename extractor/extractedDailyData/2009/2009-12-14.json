  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nBelieve it or not, this is the North Pole of Saturn.\n\nIt is unclear how\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11682\">an unusual hexagonal cloud system</a> that surrounds\nSaturn's north pole was created, keeps its shape, or how long it will last.\n\nOriginally discovered during the\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Voyager</a>\nflybys of Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen\n<a href=\"http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=3350\">anything like it</a> elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nAlthough its\n<a href=\"ap070403.html\">infrared glow</a> was visible previously to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_spacecraft#Spacecraft_design\">Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn, over the past year the mysterious hexagonal vortex became fully illuminated by sunlight for the\n<a href=\"ap090930.html\">first time</a> during the Cassini's visit.\n\nSince then, Cassini has imaged the\n<a href=\"http://www.clickmazes.com/spin/ixspin.htm\">rotating hexagon</a>\nin visible light enough times to create a\n<a href=\"http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=6032\">time-lapse movie</a>.  \n\nThe pole center was not well imaged and has been excluded. \n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZAI1LkFlVg\">movie</a> shows many unexpected cloud motions,\nsuch as waves emanating from the corners of the hexagon.  \n\n<a href=\"http://dps.aas.org/\">Planetary scientists</a> are sure to continue to study this most <a href=\"ap060117.html\">unusual cloud formation</a> for quite some time.",
