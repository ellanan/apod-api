  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt was along the way.  \n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/\">robotic rover\nOpportunity</a> currently rolling across the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridiani_Planum\">Meridiani Plain</a>\non Mars has a destination of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_(crater)\">Endeavour Crater</a>,\na large crater over 20 kilometers across which may yield additional clues about the cryptic past of ancient Mars.\n\nBesides passing open fields of\n<a href=\"ap050822.html\">dark soil</a> and\n<a href=\"ap040127.html\">light rock</a>,\nOpportunity has chanced upon several interesting features.  \n\nOne such feature, pictured above in a\n<a href=\"ap090120.html\">digitally stitched and horizontally compressed panorama</a>, is Nereus Crater, a small crater about 10 meters across that is\nsurrounded by jagged rock.  \n\nBesides <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereus\">Nereus</a>, Opportunity recently also happened upon another unusual rock -- one that appears to be the\n<a href=\"ap050121.html\">third</a>\n<a href=\"ap090813.html\">large</a>\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12254\">meteorite</a>\nfound on Mars and the second for Opportunity during only this trip.  \n\nOpportunity has been\n<a href=\"ap080519m.html\">traveling</a> toward\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hortonheardawho/with/4012227846/\">Endeavour Crater</a> for over a year now, and if it can avoid ridged rocks and\n<a href=\"ap090601.html\">soft sand</a> along the way, \nit may reach Endeavour sometime next year.",
