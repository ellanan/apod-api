  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are many large craters on Mercury relatively smooth inside?\n\nRecent images from the robotic\n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/index.html\">MESSENGER\nspacecraft</a> that flew by Mercury last October show previously uncharted regions of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)\">Mercury</a> that have large craters with an internal smoothness similar to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_maria\">maria</a> on Earth's own Moon.\n\nTherefore, like\n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=800\">our Moon's maria</a>, these\n<a href=\"ap090504.html\">craters on Mercury</a> are thought to have been flooded by lava floes that are old but not as old as the surrounding more highly cratered surface.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11773\">above image</a> mosaic of the western limb of Mercury was created by MESSENGER as it approached the Solar System's innermost planet last October.  \n\nOld and heavily textured terrain runs across much of the image bottom, while across the middle left lies comparatively smooth\n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">impact basins</a>\nwhere small craters may appear similar at first to protruding hills.  \n\nMESSENGER will buzz\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bESWV_oKqI\">past Mercury</a>\nagain later this year before entering orbit in 2011.",
