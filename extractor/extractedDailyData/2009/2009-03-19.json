  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nEvery 14 to 15 years, Saturn's rings\n<a href=\"ap090304.html\">are tilted</a>\nedge-on to our line of sight.\n\nAs the bright, beautiful rings seem to grow narrower\nit becomes increasingly\ndifficult to see them, even with large telescopes.\n\nBut it does provide the opportunity to watch multiple\ntransits of Saturn's moons.\n\nDuring a transit, a sunlit moon and its shadow\nglide across the cloudy face of the gas giant.\n\nRecorded on February 24,\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2009/12/index.html\">this\nHubble image</a> is part of a\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2009/12/video/\">sequence</a>\nshowing the transit of four of Saturn's moons.\n\nFrom left to right are <a href=\"ap050224.html\">Enceladus</a>\nand <a href=\"ap051205.html\">shadow</a>,\n<a href=\"ap051021.html\">Dione</a>\nand <a href=\"ap050329.html\">shadow</a>, and\nSaturn's largest moon <a href=\"ap041028.html\">Titan</a>.\n\nSmall moon <a href=\"ap050308.html\">Mimas</a> is just\ntouching Saturn's disk near the\nring plane at the far right.\n\nThe shadows of Titan and Mimas have both moved off\nthe right side of the disk.\n\n<a href=\"ap090111.html\">Saturn itself</a>\nhas an equatorial diameter of about 120,000 kilometers.",
