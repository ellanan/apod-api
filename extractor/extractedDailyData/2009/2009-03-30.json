  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs this a mud volcano on Mars?\n\nIf so, could it be dredging up martian microbes?\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20127005.000-is-life-bubbling-up-in-mars-mud.html\">strange possibility</a> has been\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2009/pdf/1749.pdf\">suggested recently</a> and seems to fit several recent observations of Mars.\n\nFirst of all, hills like this seem to better resemble\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_volcanoes\">mud volcanoes</a>\non Earth than\n<a href=\"ap020808.html\">lava volcanoes</a> and\n<a href=\"ap071022.html\">impact craters</a> on Mars.\n\nNext, the\n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/pdf/PSP_008561_2205.pdf\">pictured dome</a> has an unusually textured surface consistent with fractured ice.\n\n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">Infrared</a> images from space indicate that hills like this cool more quickly than surrounding rock, consistent with a dried mud composition.\n\nThe hills also reflect colors consistent with a composition that formed in the presence of water.  \n\nFinally, unusual\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/marsmethane.html\">plumes of gas containing methane</a> have been found on Mars with\n<a href=\"ap090119.html\">unknown origin</a>.\n\nThese gas plumes could conceivably have been liberated by\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDyjXowkhVY\">mud volcanoes</a>, were the initially warm mud to contain\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=941\">methane-producing microbes</a> drifting in a previously unobservable\n<a href=\"ap040404.html\">underground lake</a>.\n\nA candidate <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQw9lrsnp-4\">mud volcano</a> over 100 meters across is\n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008561_2205\">pictured above</a> in the northern plains of Mars.",
