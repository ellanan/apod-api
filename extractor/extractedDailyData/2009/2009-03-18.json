  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow many stars can you see?  Through next week, the \n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/\">GLOBE at Night</a> project invites \n<a href=\"ap080722.html\">people from all over the world</a> \nto go outside at night, look up, and see!  \n\nSpecifically, people are invited to go out an hour after sunset and look for the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)\">constellation Orion</a> toward the west.  \n\nRather than count \n<a href=\"ap090210.html\">Orion's stars</a> directly, however, the \n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/student.html\">GLOBE at Night</a> \nwebsite has made things easier by providing several \n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/observe_magnitude.html\">star charts</a> \nto which you can compare your \n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/observe_finder.html\">view of Orion</a>.  \n\nPossible matches extend from a \n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/images/40N_m3_b.jpg\">bright sky</a> \nwhere only a few Orion stars are visible, to a very \n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/images/40N_m7_b.jpg\">dark sky</a> \nwhere over 100 Orion stars are visible.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/GaN/analyze.html\">Pictured above</a> \nare results from \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr08/pr0805.html\">last year's sky observation campaign</a>.\n\nSince 2009 is the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy2009.org/\">International Year of Astronomy</a>, \nit is hoped that an even better map can be created this year.  \n\nBy <a href=\"ap040808.html\">participating</a> \nin this easy and fun activity, you are helping \n<a href=\"ap081005.html\">humanity</a> to better \n<a href=\"http://www.darksky.org/ \">understand</a> how \n<a href=\"ap010827.html\">light</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9rhdq1DRMM\">pollution</a> \nis changing across the Earth.",
