  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIn 1996, an unexpectedly bright comet passed by planet Earth.\n\nDiscovered less than two months before,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hyakutake\">Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake</a> came within only 1/10th of the Earth-Sun distance from the Earth in late March.\n\nAt that time, Comet Hyakutake, dubbed the\n<a href=\"ap960208.html\">Great Comet of 1996</a>,\nbecame the brightest comet to grace the skies of Earth in 20 years.  \n\nDuring its previous visit,\n<a href=\"ap020310.html\">Comet Hyakutake</a>\nmay well have been seen by the stone age\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalenian\">Magdalenian culture</a>,\nwho 17,000 years ago were possibly among the first humans to live in\n<a href=\"http://www.insteadofapes.com/tents/index.html\">tents</a> as well as caves.\n\nPictured above near closest approach as it appeared on\n1996 March 26, the long ion and dust tails of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LFANFFBa9o\">Comet Hyakutake</a> are visible flowing off to the left in front of a\ndistant star field that includes both the\n<a href=\"ap070108.html\">Big and Little Dippers</a>.\n\nOn the far left, the blue ion tail appears to have recently undergone a\n<a href=\"ap071003.html\">magnetic disconnection</a> event.\n\nOn the far right, the comet's green-tinted\n<a href=\"ap071121.html\">coma</a> obscures a\n<a href=\"ap050915.html\">dense nucleus</a> of melting dirty ice estimated to be about 5 kilometers across.  \n\nA few months later, Comet\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3305936.html?page=1&amp;c=y\">Hyakutake</a> began its long trek back to the outer Solar System.  \n\nBecause of being gravitationally deflected by massive planets, Comet Hyakutake is not expected back for about 100,000 years.",
