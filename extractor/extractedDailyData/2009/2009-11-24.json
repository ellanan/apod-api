  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening on the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus?\n\nEnormous ice jets are erupting.  \n\nGiant plumes of ice have been \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=2372\">photographed in dramatic fashion</a> by the robotic \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> during this \n<a href=\"http://ciclops.org/view_event/120/Enceladus_Rev_121_Flyby_Raw_Preview\">past weekend's flyby</a> of Saturn's moon Enceladus.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002227/\">Pictured above</a>, numerous plumes are seen rising from long \n<a href=\"ap090628.html\">tiger-stripe</a> canyons across \n<a href=\"ap081014.html\">Enceladus' craggy</a> \n<a href=\"ap081105.html\">surface</a>.  \n\nSeveral ice jets are even visible in the shadowed region of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fpErxgWzQ\">crescent Enceladus</a> as they reach high enough to scatter sunlight.  \n\nOther plumes, near the top of the \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/image/N00146851_55_rotated_mosaic.png\">above image</a>, appear visible just over the moon's sunlit edge.  \n\nThat <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28moon%29\">Enceladus</a> vents fountains of ice was first \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBhAPz5pqYg\">discovered on Cassini</a> images in 2005, and has been under close study ever since.\n\nContinued study of the \n<a href=\"ap071013.html\">ice plumes</a> may yield further clues as to whether underground oceans, <a href=\"http://www1.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/enceladus-f20080326.html\">candidates for containing life</a>, exist on this distant ice world.",
