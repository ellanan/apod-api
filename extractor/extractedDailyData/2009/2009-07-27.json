  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening at the center of spiral galaxy NGC 1097?  \n\nNo one is sure, but it likely involves a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole\">supermassive black hole</a>.\n\nMatter\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009arXiv0903.0313D\">falling in</a> from a\n<a href=\"ap080622.html\">bar of stars</a> and gas across the center is likely being heated by an extremely energetic region surrounding the\n<a href=\"ap070114.html\">central black hole</a>.  \n\nFrom afar, the entire central region appears in the\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2009-14/ssc2009-14a.shtml\">above</a> false-color\n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared</a> image as a\n<a href=\"ap061112.html\">mysterious eye</a>.\n\nNear the left edge and seen in blue, a smaller\n<a href=\"ap080909.html\">companion galaxy</a>\nis wrapped in the spectacular spiral arms of the large spiral, lit in pink by glowing\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Mathis/Mathis1.html\">dust</a>.\n\nCurrently about 40 thousand\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> from the larger galaxy's center,\nthe gravity of the companion galaxy appears to be reshaping the\nlarger galaxy as it is slowly being destroyed itself.\n\n<a href=\"ap061201.html\">NGC 1097</a> is located about 50 million light years away toward the constellation of the furnace\n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax\">Fornax</a>).",
