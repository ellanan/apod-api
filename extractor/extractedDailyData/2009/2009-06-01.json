  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWill Spirit be able to free itself from soft ground on Mars?\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_rover\">robotic Spirit rover</a>\ncurrently rolling across\n<a href=\"ap080714.html\">Mars</a> ran into unexpectedly soft ground last month while exploring the red planet.\n\nA worry is that the <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20090518a.html\">ground is so soft</a> that Spirit won't be able to free itself, will have to stay put and thereafter study what it can from its current position near an unusual martian land feature named\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Plate_(Mars)\">Home Plate</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12002\">Pictured above</a>, the front left wheel appears to be primarily digging itself in when \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKxyoud_c-E\">spun</a>, \nwhile on the other side, the front right wheel no longer \nspins and is dragged by the five year old\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UmRx4dEdRI\">mechanical explorer</a>.  \n\nIn the distance, rocks and rusty dirt fill the\n<a href=\"ap080129.html\">alien landscape</a> in front of the distant\n<a href=\"ap060703.html\">Husband Hill</a>.  \n\nNASA continues to study\n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status.html#spirit\">the situation</a>, and engineers and scientists have not yet run out of ideas of how to use Spirit's six wheels.\n\nFar across Mars, Spirit's twin\n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">Opportunity</a> continues on its two year\n<a href=\"ap061017.html\">trek</a> toward\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_(crater)\">Endeavour crater</a>.",
