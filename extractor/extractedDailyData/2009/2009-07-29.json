  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWas Devils Tower once an explosive volcano?\n\nFamous for its appearance in films such as\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind\">Close Encounters</a>, the origin of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Tower_National_Monument\">Devil's Tower</a> in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming\">Wyoming</a>,\nUSA is still debated, with a leading hypothesis holding that it is\na hardened lava plume that probably never reached the surface to become a\n<a href=\"ap070918.html\">volcano</a>.  \n\nThe lighter rock that once surrounded the dense \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_neck\">volcanic neck</a> \nhas now eroded away, leaving the dramatic tower.\n\nHigh <a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3002054\">above</a>, the central band of the Milky Way galaxy arches across the sky.\n\nMany notable sky objects are\n<a href=\"ap090519.html\">visible</a>, including dark strands of the\n<a href=\"ap020526.html\">Pipe Nebula</a> and the reddish\n<a href=\"ap080715.html\">Lagoon Nebula</a> to the tower's right.\n\nGreen grass and trees line the moonlit foreground, while clouds appear near the horizon to \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/deto/faqs.htm\">the tower</a>'s left.\n\nUnlike many other international landmarks, mountaineers are permitted to climb\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmeJJk7K3q0\">Devils Tower</a>.",
