  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes, after your eyes adapt to the dark, a spectacular sky appears.\n\nIn this case, a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Slave_Lake\">picturesque lake</a>\nlies in front of you, beautiful green\n<a href=\"ap051120.html\">auroras flap</a> high above you,\nbrilliant stars shine far in the distance, and a brilliant moon shines\njust ahead of you.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.blue-moon.ca/2009sep.html\">This digitally fused panorama</a> was captured earlier this month from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowknife\">Yellowknife</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories\">Northwest Territories</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>, and includes the\n<a href=\"ap060109.html\">Pleiades</a>\n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a> of stars just to the upper right of the Moon.\n\nSince auroras are ultimately started by\n<a href=\"ap071106.html\">solar activity</a>, this current flurry of\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/aurora/gallery_01sep09.htm\">aurora</a>s is somewhat surprising, given the historic\n<a href=\"ap080924.html\">lack of sunspots</a> and other activity on the Sun over the past two years.\n\nThis time of year is known as\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/23sep_auroraseason.htm\">aurora season</a>, however, for noted average increases in\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejMAvo9JYBM\">aurora</a>s.\n\nThe reason for the yearly increase is not known for sure, but possibly relates to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AxialTiltObliquity.png\">tilt</a> of the Earth creating a more easily traversable connection between the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field\">Earth's magnetic field</a> and the magnetic field of the\n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">Sun's changing wind</a> streams.",
