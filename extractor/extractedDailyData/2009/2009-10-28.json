  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat if we could see back to the beginning of the universe?\n\nWe can -- since it takes the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe\">age of the universe</a> for light to cross the universe.\n\nPeering at distant objects, therefore, tells us about\n<a href=\"ap060323.html\">how the universe used to be</a>, even\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSZqhqR5XKM\">near its beginning</a>.\n\nSince telescopes are therefore also\n<a href=\"ap050413.html\">time portals</a>, observations of\ndistant clusters can be used, for example, to investigate when and how these\n<a href=\"ap060321.html\">huge galaxy conglomerations</a> formed.\n\nPreviously, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift\">redshift</a>\n<a href=\"ap001019.html\">record</a> for a galaxy cluster was about 1.5, corresponding to about nine billion\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> distant.\n\nRecently, using data including\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj39fg9DofU\">X-ray images</a> from the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a>, a new farthest cluster was identified.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/jkcs041/\">Shown above</a>,\nJKCS041 is seen at redshift 1.9, corresponding to nearly one billion light years farther than the previous record holder.\n\nThe hot X-ray gas that confirmed the\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/22/galaxy-cluster-far-far-away-smashes-distance-record/\">apparent galaxy grouping</a> as a true cluster of galaxies is <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/jkcs041/\">shown above</a> in diffuse blue, superposed on an optical image showing many foreground stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008arXiv0812.1699A\">JKCS041</a> is seen today as it appeared at only one quarter of the present age of the universe.",
