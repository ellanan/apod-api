  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere can a telescope take you?  \n\nFour hundred years ago, a telescope took \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo\">Galileo</a> to the \n<a href=\"ap050305.html\">Moon</a> to discover craters, to \n<a href=\"ap950801.html\">Saturn</a> to discover rings, to \n<a href=\"ap001118.html\">Jupiter</a> to discover moons, to \n<a href=\"ap090424.html\">Venus</a> to discover phases, and to the \n<a href=\"ap031027.html\">Sun</a> to discover spots.\n\nToday, in celebration of Galileo's telescopic achievements and as part of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy2009.org/\">International Year of Astronomy</a>, NASA has used its entire fleet of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Observatories\">Great Observatories</a>, and the \n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Eniac.jpg\">Internet</a>, to bring the center of our Galaxy to you.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/28/full/\">Pictured above</a>, in greater detail and in more colors than ever seen before, are the combined images of the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in near-infrared light, the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> in infrared light, and the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=CHANDRA\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> in X-ray light.\n\nA menagerie of vast star \n<a href=\"ap090107.html\">fields is visible</a>, along with dense star clusters, long filaments of gas and dust, expanding supernova remnants, and the \n<a href=\"ap080427.html\">energetic surroundings</a> of what likely is our \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xZsgZ0oSo\">Galaxy's central</a> black hole.\n\nMany of these features are labeled on a \n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2009-28-g-compass_large_web.jpg\">complementary annotated image</a>. \n\nOf course, a \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/telescope.htm\">telescope</a>'s magnification and light-gathering ability create only an image of what a human could see if visiting these places.  \n\nTo actually go requires \n<a href=\"ap041212.html\">rockets</a>.",
