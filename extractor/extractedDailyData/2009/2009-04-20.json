  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhen does Mars act like a liquid?  \n\nAlthough liquids freeze and evaporate quickly into the \nthin atmosphere of Mars, persistent winds may make large \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/13/dune-mars-2/\">sand dunes appear</a> to flow and even drip like a liquid.  \n\nVisible on the \n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007676_1385\">above image</a> right are two flat top mesas in southern Mars, where the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/mars/calendar.html\">season is changing</a> from Spring to Summer.  \n\nA light dome topped hill is also visible on the far left of \n<a href=\"http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/apr09image.html\">the image</a>.\n\n\nAs winds blow from right to left, flowing sand on and around the hills leaves \n<a href=\"ap080303.html\">picturesque streaks</a>.  \n\nThe dark arc-shaped \n<a href=\"ap010226.html\">droplets</a> of fine sand are called \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barchans\">barchans</a>, \nand are the interplanetary cousins of similar Earth-based sand forms.\n\n<a href=\"http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/enlarge/barchan-dunes-photography.html\">Barchans</a> can move intact downwind and can even appear to pass through each other.\n\nOver the past few weeks, \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00001908/\">winds on southern Mars</a> have been kicking up dust and are \n<a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Martian-Dust-Storms-Threatens-the-Twin-Rovers-109587.shtml\">being watched</a> to see if they \n<a href=\"ap011017.html\">escalate</a> into another of Mars' famous planet-scale \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD7IedPZvt8\">sand storms</a>.",
