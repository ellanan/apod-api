  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over that town?\n\nClose inspection shows these strange columns of light occur over bright lights, and so likely involve falling \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystals\">ice crystals</a> reflecting back these lights.\n\nThe reason why these pillars fan out at the top, however, is currently unknown -- \n<a href=\"http://www.owensworld.com/funnyimages/files/Liverpoolcrowd_big.jpg\">readers of APOD</a> might help figure this out by participating in an \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=15219\">online discussion</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/submissions/large_image_popup.php?image_name=Aigar-Truhin-LightPillar_0854_1230501854.jpg\">above image and several similar images</a> were taken with a standard digital camera in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigulda\">Sigulda</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia\">Latvia</a> last month.  \n\nThe air was \n<a href=\"http://www.spacesciences.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=02&amp;month=01&amp;year=2009\">noted</a> to be quite cold and indeed filled with small ice crystals, just the type known to create several awe-inspiring but well known \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/\">sky phenomena</a> such as \n<a href=\"ap060305.html\">light pillars</a>, \n<a href=\"ap060205.html\">sun pillars</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog\">sun dogs</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap081207.html\">moon halos</a>.  \n\nThe cold and \n<a href=\"ap041130.html\">snowy winter</a> occurring this year in parts of Earth's northern hemisphere is giving \n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> new and typically unexpected opportunities to see several of these unusual optical \n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/home.rxml\">atmospheric phenomena</a> for themselves.",
