  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNow growing brighter, Comet Lulin is headed for its\nclosest approach to planet Earth early next week.\n\nBut the comet's <a href=\"ap090207.html\">greenish glow</a>,\nfamiliar to\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/\ngallery_lulin_page8.htm\">earthbound skygazers</a>, is replaced\nby false colors in\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/lulin.html\">this\npremier view</a> from the\norbiting\n<a href=\"http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html\">Swift\nsatellite</a>.\n\nImage data from the Swift detectors, normally intended to\nfollow cosmic\n<a href=\"ap080328.html\">gamma-ray bursts</a>, were recorded on January 28.\n\nThe data are\ncombined here, along with a sky survey image of background stars,\nto show optical and ultraviolet light in green-blue hues\nand x-rays from the comet in red. \n\nThe result maps remarkable\n<a href=\"ap960411.html\">x-ray emission</a> on the comet's sunward\nside as incoming <a href=\"ap030920.html\">solar wind</a> ions interact\nwith gases in the swollen\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/comet_worldbook.html\">coma</a>.\n\nIt also shows substantial ultraviolet emission opposite the Sun,\nin the direction of motion and the comet's tail.\n\nThe ultraviolet emission is from the OH molecule derived\nfrom the breakup of water, an indicator of the copius amounts of water\nproduced by this extremely\n<a href=\"ap980410.html\">active comet</a>.\n\nIn fact, astronomers estimate Lulin was releasing about\n800 gallons of water each second, enough to fill an Olympic-size\nswimming pool in less than 15 minutes.",
