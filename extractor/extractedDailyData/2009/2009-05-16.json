  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn Wednesday, May 13, two, tiny, fast moving spots crossed an\notherwise featureless solar disk.\n\nNot sunspots though, the dark blemishes were silhouettes of\nthe <a href=\"ap090513.html\">shuttle orbiter Atlantis</a> and the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nside by side.\n\nTo record this sharp picture of the orbiting pair\nagainst the face of the Sun, astronomer\nThierry Legault carefully set up his camera and telescope near\nthe center of a 5 kilometer wide path\n<a href=\"http://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/16?\">of visibility</a>\nabout 100 kilometers south of\n<a href=\"http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/tour-destinations-map.aspx\">Kennedy\nSpace Center</a> in Florida.\n\nHe opened the shutter for 1/8,000 second at 12:17 EDT, catching\nAtlantis and Hubble at a range of 600 kilometers while they\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/realtime/\">were moving</a> at 7\nkilometers/second.\n\nThe total duration of the\n<a href=\"ap061014.html\">transit</a> (Sun crossing) was 0.8 seconds.\n\nEnlarged in the inset view, Atlantis (top) is approaching Hubble\nprior to capturing the space telescope.\n\nThursday, astronauts began a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/\nindex.html?param=public\">series of\nspacewalks</a> to perform the maintenance as part of the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/servicing_mission_4/\">final mission\nto Hubble</a>.",
