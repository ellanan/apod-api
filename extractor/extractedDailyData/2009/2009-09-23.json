  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow similar is exoplanet CoRoT-7b to Earth?  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-33-09.html\">newly discovered</a>  \nextra-solar planet is the closest physical match yet,\nwith a mass about five Earths and a radius of about 1.7 Earths.\n\nAlso, the home star to\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COROT-7b\">CoRoT-7b</a>,\nalthough 500 light years distant, is very similar to our Sun.\n\nUnfortunately, the similarities likely end there, as\nCoRoT-7b orbits its home star well inside the orbit of\n<a href=\"ap080127.html\">Mercury</a>, making its year\nlast only 20 hours, and making its peak temperature\n<a href=\"ap080521.html\">much hotter</a> than humans might find comfortable.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrdEhWsQV64\">CoRoT</a>-7b was discovered in February by noting a predictable slight decrease in the brightness of its parent star.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/illustrations/phot-33a-09-fullres.tif.html\">Pictured above</a>, an artist's depiction shows how\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COROT\">CoRoT</a>-7b might appear in front of its parent star.  \n\nThe composition of\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2009/09/16/smallest-expoplanet-yet-has-rocky-surface/\">CoRoT-7b</a> remains unknown, but given its size and mass, it cannot be a\n<a href=\"ap031114.html\">gas giant</a> like Jupiter,\nand is very likely composed predominantly of rock.  \n\nFuture observations will likely narrow the composition of one of the first known rocky\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanets\">planets discovered outside</a>\nof our Solar System.",
