  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Owl Nebula is perched in the sky about 2,600 light-years away\ntoward the bottom of the\n<a href=\"ap050218.html\">Big Dipper's</a> bowl.\n\nAlso\n<a href=\"http://www.delphes.net/messier/m/m097.html\">cataloged as M97</a>,\nthe 97th object in Messier's well-known\nlist, its round shape along with the placement of\ntwo large, dark \"eyes\" do suggest the face of a\n<a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/mp/ccao/newmelones/images/\nwildlife_barn_owl.jpg\">staring owl</a>.\n\nOne of the fainter objects in\n<a href=\"http://messier.obspm.fr/\">Messier's catalog</a>,\nthe Owl Nebula is a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>,\nthe glowing gaseous\n<a href=\"ap090507.html\">envelope shed by</a>\na dying sun-like star as it runs out of\n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.llnl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/\nNebula.html\">nuclear fuel</a>.\n\nIn fact, the Owl Nebula offers an example of the fate of our\nSun as it runs out of fuel in another 5 billion years.\n\nAs we see it, the nebula spans over 2 light-years making it\nroughly 2,000 times the diameter of Neptune's orbit.\n\nBeautiful to look at,\n<a href=\"http://www.lostvalleyobservatory.com/page37nbm97owlnebula/\">this\ncolor image</a> shows impressive details within the cosmic owl.\n\nThe composite includes images made through\nnarrow-band filters for a total of 24 hours\nof exposure time.",
