  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus?  \n\nVast sections of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29\">this strange world</a>\nare dark as\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal\">coal</a>, while others are as bright as ice.  \n\nThe composition of the dark material is unknown, but\n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared</a>\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">spectra</a> indicate that it possibly contains some dark form of\n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html\">carbon</a>.\n\n\nIapetus also has an unusual\n<a href=\"ap050201.html\">equatorial ridge</a> that makes it appear like a\n<a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=99\">walnut</a>.  \n\nTo help better understand this seemingly painted moon,\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/index.html\">NASA</a>\ndirected the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_spacecraft\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a>\norbiting Saturn to swoop\n<a href=\"ap070919.html\">within 2,000 kilometers</a> in 2007.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08384\">Pictured above</a>,\nfrom about 75,000 kilometers out, Cassini's trajectory allowed unprecedented imaging of the hemisphere of Iapetus that is\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking\">always trailing</a>.  \n\nA huge impact crater seen in the south spans a tremendous 450 kilometers\nand appears superposed on an\n<a href=\"ap060530.html\">older crater</a> of similar size.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap070914.html\">dark material</a>\nis seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of\n<a href=\"ap060103.html\">Iapetus</a>, darkening craters and highlands alike.  \n\n<a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/\">Close inspection</a> indicates that the dark coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick.\n\nA <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005DPS....37.3908S\">leading hypothesis</a> is that the dark material is mostly\ndirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty ice\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)\">sublimates</a>.\n\nAn initial coating of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYvITG_TDfE\">dark material</a> may have been effectively painted on by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from other moons.\n\nThis and other images from Cassini's\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baaGOqIJaFM\">Iapetus flyby</a> are being studied for even greater clues.",
