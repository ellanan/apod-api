  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan a planet be as large as the star that it orbits?\n\nRecent observations have discovered that nearby \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VB_10\">Van Biesbroeck's star</a> \nmight have just such a large planet.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=2168\">VB 10</a> lies only about 20 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away, it is a small \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf\">red dwarf</a> star so dim, \nat 17th <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)\">magnitude</a>, that a telescope is needed to see it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.solstation.com/stars/wolf1055.htm\">Van Biesbroeck's star</a>\nwas previously known for its rapid \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion\">proper motion</a> \nacross the sky -- it moves so fast it could cross a \n<a href=\"ap080820.html\">full moon</a> in only about 1,000 years.\n\nBy noting a <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/C-VB10b-20090528.html\">wiggle</a> in VB 10's sky trajectory, \n<a href=\"http://steps.jpl.nasa.gov/links/docs/pravdoshaklan09vb10b.pdf\">astronomers were able to infer</a> the existence of a \nplanet several times the mass of \n<a href=\"ap080108.html\">Jupiter</a>.\n\nAlthough the star VB 10 is perhaps 10 times more massive than the discovered planet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VB_10b\">VB 10b</a>, \nthe star is likely more highly compressed and so the two might be closely matched in size.\n\nSuch a system is \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12015\">envisioned above</a> with an artist's illustration.\n\nSince faint <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-type_star#Class_M\">M-type stars</a> like VB 10 are so common, \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_bqsqJRg_0\">planetary system</a>s surrounding them, including planets larger than their parent star, \nmight be more common than planetary systems like our own \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system\">Solar System</a>.",
