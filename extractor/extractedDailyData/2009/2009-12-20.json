  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you went outside at exactly the same time every day and took a\npicture that included the Sun, how would the Sun appear to move?  \n\nWith <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nImage:Train_wreck_at_Montparnasse_1895.jpg\">great planning</a>\nand effort, such a\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLNqaYFqvoA\">series of images</a> can be taken.  \n\nThe figure-8 path the Sun follows over\n<a href=\"https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/kahl/www/Images/Weather/Other/analemma.html\">the course of a year</a>\nis called an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma\">analemma</a>.  \n\nThis coming Tuesday, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice\">Winter Solstice</a>\nday in Earth's northern hemisphere, the Sun will be at the bottom of the analemma.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmHwyQwn0Sg\">Analemma</a>s created from different latitudes would appear at least slightly different, as well as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhqzW97_47w\">analemmas</a> created at a different time each day.\n\nWith even greater planning and effort,\nthe series can include a\n<a href=\"ap050407.html\">total eclipse of the Sun</a> as one of the images.\n\nPictured is such a total solar eclipse\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma\">analemma</a>\nor Tutulemma -\na term coined by the photographers based on the Turkish word for eclipse.\n\nThe composite image sequence was recorded from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a> starting\nin 2005.\n\nThe base image for the sequence is from the\n<a href=\"ap060404.html\">total phase</a> of a solar eclipse as viewed\nfrom <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side%2C_Turkey\">Side</a>,\nTurkey on 2006 March 29.\n\nVenus was also visible during totality, toward the lower right.",
