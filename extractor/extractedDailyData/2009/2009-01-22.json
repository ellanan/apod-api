  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNGC 2818 is a beautiful\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2000/28/pne.html\">planetary nebula</a>,\nthe gaseous shroud of a\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1997/\n38/background/\">dying sun-like star</a>.\n\nIt could well offer a glimpse of the future that\nawaits our own Sun after spending another 5 billion years or\nso steadily using up hydrogen at its core, and then finally helium, as\nfuel for <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/\nastro/astfus.html\">nuclear</a> fusion.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984ApJ...287..341D\">Curiously</a>,\nNGC 2818 seems to lie within an open star\ncluster, NGC 2818A, that is some 10,000 light-years distant\ntoward the southern constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/pyx/index.html\">Pyxis</a>\n(the Compass).\n\nAt the distance of the star cluster, the nebula\nwould be about 4 light-years across.\n\nBut accurate velocity measurements show that the nebula's own velocity\nis very different from the cluster's member stars.\n\nThe result is <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.2900\">strong evidence</a>\nthat NGC 2818 is only by chance found along the line of sight to\nthe star cluster and so may not share the cluster's distance\n<a href=\"ap990305.html\">or age</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2009/05/\">Hubble image is</a>\na composite of exposures through narrow-band filters,\npresenting emission from nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms\nin the nebula as red, green, and blue hues.",
