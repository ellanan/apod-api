  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTwo galaxies are squaring off in Virgo and here are the latest pictures.  \n\nWhen two\n<a href=\"ap040612.html\">galaxies collide</a>, the stars that compose them usually do not.\n\nThis is because <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy\">galaxies</a>\nare mostly empty space and, however bright, stars only take up only a small fraction of that space.\n\nBut during the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_galaxy\">collision</a>, one galaxy can rip the other apart gravitationally, and dust and gas common to both galaxies does\n<a href=\"colliding_galaxies.html\">collide</a>.\n\nIf the two <a href=\"http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/models/models.html\">galaxies merge</a>, black holes that likely resided in each galaxy center\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...622L..93M\">may  eventually\nmerge</a>.\n\nBecause the distances are so large, the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXy3B2K47Qg\">whole thing</a> takes place in slow motion -- over hundreds of millions of years.\n\nBesides the two\n<a href=\"ap080721.html\">large spiral galaxies</a>,\na smaller third galaxy is visible on the far left of the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/14/image/a/\">above image</a> of Arp 274, also known as NGC 5679.\n\nArp 274 spans about 200,000\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> across and lies about 400 million light years away toward the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation)\">constellation of Virgo</a>.",
