  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat does a solar prominence look like in three dimensions?\n\nTo help find out, NASA\n<a href=\"ap080316.html\">launch</a>ed the\n<a href=\"http://www.stereo.jhuapl.edu/\">STEREO</a> satellites to keep a steady eye on the Sun from two different vantage points.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html\">STEREO satellites</a> orbit the Sun nearly along Earth's orbit, but one (dubbed Ahead) currently leads the Earth, while the other (dubbed Behind) currently trails.  \n\nThree weeks ago, a <a href=\"ap081004.html\">powerful prominence</a>\nerupted and remained above the Sun for about 30 hours, allowing the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO\">STEREO satellites</a> to get numerous views of the prominence from different angles.\n\n<a href=\"http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/item.php?gid=1&amp;id=106\">Pictured above</a> is a high-resolution image of\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/multimedia/filament_eruption.html\">the event</a> from the STEREO Ahead satellite.  \n\nA video of the\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=08&amp;month=10&amp;year=2009\">prominence erupting</a>\nas seen from both spacecraft can be found\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RjswBx6ysQ\">here</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap080924.html\">unusually quiet</a> nature of the Sun over the past two years has made large prominences like this relatively rare.\n\nThe combined\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_vision\">perspective of STEREO</a>\nwill help astronomers better understand the mechanisms for the creation and evolution of <a href=\"ap000403.html\">prominences</a>,\n<a href=\"ap070206.html\">coronal mass ejections</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap031029.html\">flares</a>.",
