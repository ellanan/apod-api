  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happened to the Moon?\n\n\nNothing, although from some locations, February's full moon, \nwhich occurred about two weeks ago, appeared \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage_of_astronomical_objects\">strangely distorted</a> as it rose.  \n\n\nVisible in particular was a \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/sunmir2.htm\">curiously \ninverted image</a> section pinched off \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">near the horizon</a>, \nan effect dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/etruscan_vase_with_flowers/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=110001831\">Etruscan vase</a> by the pioneering science fiction writer \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne\">Jules Verne</a> for its familiar shape.  \n\nThis odd moon image piece was created by moonlight \n<a href=\"http://www.ps.missouri.edu/rickspage/refract/refraction.html\">refracting</a> through an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_inversion\">atmospheric inversion layer</a> on \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> where cold air was \ntrapped near the surface.\n\nThe photographer also reported that, as the moon rose, a \n<a href=\"ap050922.html\">red rim</a> was faintly \nvisible on the lower part of the moon, while a \n<a href=\"ap050826.html\">green rim</a> appeared on the top.  \n\nSimilar to the Sun's famous \n<a href=\"ap040321.html\">green flash</a>, these \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaMg6L67G2Y\">effects arise</a> \nwhen the Earth's atmosphere acts like a \n<a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/prism/\">prism</a>, sending different colors of light on slightly \ndifferent paths.  \n\nThe above image mosaic has been \n<a href=\"ap061101.html\">horizontally compressed</a> by computer \nto fit a standard screen.",
