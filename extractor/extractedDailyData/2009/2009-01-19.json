  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is there methane on Mars?\n\nNo one is sure.  \n\nAn \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/marsmethane.html\">important confirmation</a> that methane exists in the atmosphere of Mars occurred last week, bolstering \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2004/0402_Methane_Found_on_Mars_Does_That_Mean.html\">previous controversial claims</a> made as early as \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003DPS....35.1418M\">2003</a>.  \n\nThe confirmation was made \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy\">spectroscopically</a> using \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory\">large \nground</a>-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Infrared_Telescope_Facility\">based telescopes</a> by finding precise colors absorbed on \n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a> that match those absorbed by methane on Earth.\n\nGiven that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> \nis destroyed in the \n<a href=\"ap090110.html\">open martian air</a> in a matter of years, \nthe present existence of the fragile gas \n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/science/space/16mars.html\">indicates</a> that it is currently being released, somehow, \nfrom the surface of Mars.\n\nOne prospect is that \n<a href=\"http://www.microbeworld.org/microbes/\">microbes</a> \nliving underground are creating it, or created it in the past.  \n\nIf true, this opens the exciting possibility that \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/life/\">life</a> might be present under the surface of Mars even today.\n\n\nGiven the present data, however, it is also \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001811/\">possible</a> that a purely geologic process, potentially involving \n<a href=\"ap070918.html\">volcanism</a> or \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust\">rust</a> \nand not involving any life forms, is the methane creator.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/303598main_mjmumma_vid_01_1280_01.jpg\">Pictured above</a> is an image of Mars superposed with a \nmap of the recent methane detection.",
