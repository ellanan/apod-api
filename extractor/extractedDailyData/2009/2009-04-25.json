  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBased on wide field photographs, American astronomer\n<a href=\"http://www.library.gatech.edu/search/digital_collections/\nbarnard/sandage.html\">Edward Emerson Barnard</a> cataloged the\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nbib_query?1919ApJ....49....1B\">dark markings of the sky</a> in the\nearly 20th century.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.library.gatech.edu/search/digital_collections/barnard/\nintro1.html\">Barnard's markings</a> are dark nebulae,\ninterstellar clouds of obscuring gas and dust.\n\nTheir shapes are visible in\n<a href=\"ap020409.html\">cosmic silhouette</a> because they\nlie in the foreground along the line-of-sight to rich star fields\nand stellar nurseries near the plane of our Galaxy.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.starrywonders.com/barnard7.html\">deep\ntelescopic image</a> from the early 21st century captures a\ntantalizing array of Barnard's dusty nebulae toward the\nconstellation Taurus and the Taurus molecular cloud\nsome 400 light-years away.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.starrywonders.com/b7labels.html\">Included in</a>\nthe nearly 1 degree wide field of view is Barnard 7\n(the 7th object in the catalog) at the upper right, next to\na dusty bluish reflection nebula.\n\nYoung variable star\n<a href=\"ap050923.html\">RY Tauri</a> is emerging from a\nyellowish cocoon of dust near top center.\n\nTypically a light-year or so across, many of Barnard's\n<a href=\"ap060409.html\">dark nebulae</a>\nare themselves likely sites of future star formation.",
