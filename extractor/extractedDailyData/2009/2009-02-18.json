  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow often do satellites collide?\n\nAlthough minuscule space debris may strike any satellite on occasion, the first known \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_satellite_collision\">collision between time two full satellites</a> \noccurred only last week.\n\nEven though thousands of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellites\">satellites</a> have been launched, the low collision rate is caused by the great vastness of space.\n\nLast week, however, a defunct Russian communications satellite named \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_2251\">Cosmos 2251</a> smashed right into an operational US communications satellite named \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33\">Iridium 33</a> over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia\">Siberia</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation\">Russia</a>.  \n\nBoth satellites were destroyed.  \n\nThe sheer number of massive particles in a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyG3zqLyW8k\">dispersing debris cloud</a>, depicted in an inset \n<a href=\"http://www.stk.com/corporate/mediaCenter/news/iridium-cosmos/\">image above</a>, increases the risk that other operating satellites might be struck by a harmful fast-moving projectile.  \n\nThe collision occurred in \n<a href=\"http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/satellite/4/4a/4a.1.html\">low Earth orbit</a> only 750 kilometers up, a height shared by many \nsatellites but significantly higher than the 350-km high human-occupied \n<a href=\"ap080623.html\">International Space Station</a>.  \n\nSince satellites may disintegrate when struck by fast-moving \n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/earth/spacejunk.shtml\">space junk</a>, the crash focuses concern that a future \ndramatic satellite <a href=\"ap080925.html\">collision</a> may one day start an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_cascade\">ablation cascade</a> \nof increasingly more collisions.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_Syndrome\">result</a> \ncould then render future human space flights increasingly risky and expensive satellite lifetimes increasingly short.",
