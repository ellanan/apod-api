  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nMany bright nebulae and star clusters in planet Earth's sky\nare associated with the name of\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/Messier/xtra/history/\nm-cat.html\">astronomer Charles Messier</a>,\nfrom his famous 18th century catalog.\n\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/Messier/xtra/m-crater.html\">His\nname is also given</a> to these two large and remarkable craters\non the Moon.\n\nStandouts in the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or Mare Fecunditatis,\nMessier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8\nand 16 by 11 kilometers respectively.\n\nTheir elongated shapes are explained by\nan extremely shallow-angle trajectory followed by\n<a href=\"http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/education/activities/\nactive15a.htm\">the impactor</a>, moving left to right,\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/\n3304151.html\">that gouged out the craters</a>.\n\nThe shallow impact also resulted in two\n<a href=\"ap050305.html\">bright rays</a> of material\nextending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture.\n\nIntended to be viewed with\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/Help/\nVendorList.html#Glasses\">red/blue glasses</a> (red for the left eye),\nthis striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently created\nfrom high resolution scans of two images\n(<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/\nframe/?AS11-42-6304\">AS11-42-6304</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/\nframe/?AS11-42-6305\">AS11-42-6305</a>)\ntaken during the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.",
