  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSmall asteroid 2008 TC3\n<a href=\"ap081108.html\">fell to Earth</a> at dawn on October 7, 2008,\ntracking through the skies over the Nubian Desert in northern Sudan.\n\nThat event was remarkable because it was the first time an\nasteroid was detected in space\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/30686199.html\">before\ncrashing</a> into planet Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIt was generally assumed the\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>\nitself had completely disintegrated to dust.\n\nBut, based on satellite and ground observations of the\natmospheric impact event,\nDr. Mauwia Shaddad of the University of Khartoum, aided by\nDr. Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute\nand NASA Ames Research Center, led\n<a href=\"http://asima.seti.org/\">an expedition of students and staff</a>\nto the area, combing the desert\nfor surviving fragments.\n\nOn December 6, 2008, two hours after their search began, the first\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/25/\nmeteorites-found-in-africa-from-first-predicted-asteroid-hit/\">meteorite\nwas found</a>.\n\nThe team ultimately collected some 280 small\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/meteorites.html\">meteorites</a>,\nnow called Almahata Sitta, with a total mass of about 5 kilograms --\nthe first material\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7237/full/\nnature07920.html\">recovered from a known asteroid</a>.\n\nIn stark contrast to the lighter-colored stones, the\nblack fragment in the picture is Almahata Sitta meteorite number 15.\n\nAbout 4 centimeters in diameter, it is seen as it came to rest on\nthe desert floor.",
