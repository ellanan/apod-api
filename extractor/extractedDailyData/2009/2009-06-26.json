  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis six month long exposure compresses the\n<a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/\nbrowse_results.php?object_id=79018\">time</a>\nfrom solstice to solstice\n(~ December 21, 2008 to June 20, 2009) into a single\npoint of view.\n\nDubbed a solargraph, the\n<a href=\"http://www.asu.cas.cz/~sos/staff/maciek/puszki.htm\">unconventional\npicture</a> was recorded with a pinhole camera\n<a href=\"http://www.pinholephotography.org/\nSolargraph%20instructions.htm\">made from</a> an aluminum  can lined\nwith a piece of photographic paper.\n\nFixed to a\n<a href=\"http://www.solargraphy.com/index.php?\noption=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=18\">single spot</a>\nfor the entire exposure, the simple camera continuously\nrecords the Sun's daily path as a glowing trail\nburned into the photosensitive paper.\n\nBreaks and gaps in the trails are caused by cloud cover.\n\nIn this case, the spot was chosen to look out\nfrom inside a\n<a href=\"http://www.asu.cas.cz/_data/k40l_1232294978.jpg\">radio telescope</a>\nat the\n<a href=\"http://www.asu.cas.cz/history\">Ondrejov Observatory</a>\nin the Czech Republic.\n\nAt the end of the exposure, the paper was removed from the\ncan and immediately scanned digitally.\n\nContrasts and colors were then enhanced and added to the\ndigital image.\n\nOf course, in December, the Sun trails\n<a href=\"ap071222.html\">begin lower</a> down\nat the northern hemisphere's winter solstice.\n\nThe trails <a href=\"ap081221.html\">climb higher</a> in the sky as the\nJune 21st summer solstice approaches.",
