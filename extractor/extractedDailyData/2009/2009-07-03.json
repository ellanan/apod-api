  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis year Aphelion, the point in Earth's\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/physical_science/\nphysics/mechanics/orbit/ellipse.html&amp;edu=high\">elliptical orbit</a>\nwhen it is farthest from the Sun, occurs tomorrow, July 4th.\n\nOf course, that doesn't\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/\nseasons.html\">affect the seasons</a> on\n<a href=\"http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/\">our fair planet</a>.\n\nThose are determined by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation and not\nEarth's distance from the Sun, so July is still winter in the south\nand summer in northern hemisphere.\n\nBut it does mean that on July 4th the Sun will be at its smallest\napparent size.\n\nThis composite neatly compares two pictures of the Sun taken with the\nsame telescope and camera\n<a href=\"http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php\">on the\ndates of</a> Perihelion (closest approach) and Aphelion in 2008.\n\nThe image labels include Earth's distance in kilometers\nfrom the Sun on the two dates.\n\nOtherwise difficult\n<a href=\"http://www.sungazer.net/\">to notice</a>, the change in the Sun's\napparent diameter between\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/physical_science/\nphysics/mechanics/orbit/perihelion_aphelion.html&amp;edu=high\">Perihelion\nand Aphelion</a> is clear.\n\nThe difference amounts to a little over 3 percent.",
