  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA flying saucer from outer space crash-landed in the Utah desert in 2004\nafter being tracked by radar and chased by helicopters.  \n\nNo <a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SFafter1940.html\">space aliens</a> were involved, however.  \n\nThe saucer,\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/genesis/multimedia/genesisrecov090804-2.html\">pictured above</a>, was the Genesis sample return capsule,\npart of a human-made robot\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=635\">Genesis spaceship</a> launched in 2001 by NASA\nitself to study the Sun.  \n\nThe unexpectedly\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2H-UkMBZ68\">hard landing</a>\nat over 300 kilometers per hour occurred because the\nparachutes did not open as planned.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(spacecraft)\">Genesis mission</a> had been orbiting the\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a> collecting\n<a href=\"ap970217.html\">solar wind</a> particles that are\nusually deflected away by\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/magnetic.html\">Earth's magnetic field</a>.\n\nDespite the crash landing, many return samples remained in good enough condition to analyze and research is\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009LPI....40.1373B\">ongoing</a>.  \n\nSo far, discoveries include new details about the\n<a href=\"http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/gm2/news/features/closer.htm\">composition</a> of the\n<a href=\"ap070624.html\">Sun</a> and the\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009NIMPB.267.1101C\">effects of the solar wind on unprotected material</a>.",
