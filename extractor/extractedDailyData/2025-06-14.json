  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhat are all those streaks in the sky?\n\nA galaxy, many satellite trails, and a few meteors. \n\nFirst, far in the distance, the majestic band of our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> runs down the left.\n\nMirroring it on the right are several parallel trails of Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/us/technology\">Starlink satellites</a>.\n\nMany fainter satellite trails also \n<a href=\"ap191014.html\">crisscross the image</a>.\n\nThe two short and bright streaks are meteors — likely members of the annual \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Aquariids\">Eta Aquariids</a> meteor shower. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/venus/\">planet Venus</a> \nshines on the lower right. \n\nVenus and the satellites shine by reflected sunlight.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJxV5ZnRDiL/\">featured picture</a> is a composite of exposures \nall taken in a few hours on May 4 over the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/snGme5Zia4Y\">Limay River</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina\">Argentina</a>.",
