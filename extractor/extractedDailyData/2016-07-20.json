  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nHow does wind affect sand on Mars?\n\nTo help find out if it differs significantly from Earth, the robotic\nCuriosity rover on Mars was directed to investigate the dark \n<a href=\"ap160119.html\">Namib Dune</a> in the Bagnold Dune Field in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale_(crater)\">Gale Crater</a>. \n\nNamib is the first active \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur_TeOs3S64\">sand dune\ninvestigated</a> up close outside of planet Earth.\n\nWind-created ripples on Earth-bound sand dunes appear similar to\nripples on Mars, with one exception.  \n\nThe larger peaks <a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/\nindex.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1917\">visible</a> on dark \n<a href=\"ap160329.html\">Namib dune</a>, averaging about 3 meters apart,\nare of a type seen only underwater on Earth. \n\nThey appear to arise on Mars because of the way the\nthin Martian wind drags dark sand particles. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20755\">featured\nimage</a> was taken last December and is \n<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/68/39/\n3f/68393f3ed2ce3ab1aa221497496fb290.jpg\">horizontally compressed</a> to\nshow context.\n\nIn the distance, a normal dusty Martian landscape slopes up\nin light orange, while a \n<a href=\"ap160502.html\">rock-strewn landscape</a>\nis visible on the far right. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)\">Curiosity</a> \nunexpectedly went into safe mode in early July, but it was \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/\nindex.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1918\">brought out</a>\nlast week and has now resumed exploring the once lake-filled interior of\nGale Crater for further signs that it was once habitable by \n<a href=\"https://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/solarsystem/mars/\">microbial\nlife</a>.",
