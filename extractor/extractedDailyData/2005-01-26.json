  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe new Delta IV Heavy Launch Vehicle is the \nlargest rocket ever to be launched by the \n<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/\">US Air Force</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bls/d4heavy/flash.html\">Delta IV Heavy</a> is capable of launching over 23,000 kilograms into \nlow Earth orbit.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/delta4hvy_launch_041221.html\">first launch</a> of the Delta IV Heavy occurred last month and was largely successful with the \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sfn_delta4hvy_update_050118.html\">exception</a> that the boosters shut off several seconds prematurely.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/delta/delta4/delta4.htm\">Boeing's Delta IV Heavy</a> is the largest of the \n<a href=\"ap951213.html\">Delta</a> IV series, \npacking the punch of three rocket boosters instead of one.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.eclipticenterprises.com/gallery_rocketcam.php\">Pictured above</a>, the Delta IV Heavy is seen lifting off by a \n<a href=\"http://www.eclipticenterprises.com/gallery_rocketcam.shtml\">RocketCam</a> perched on its side.  \n\nThe time-lapse sequence shows the launch, one of the rocket boosters being jettisoned, and a test satellite further lifting away.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ast.lmco.com/\">Lockheed Martin</a> is developing its own \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/atlas_delta_020320-1.html\">heavy lifting</a> version of its \n<a href=\"ap020916.html\">Altas rocket</a> \nseries in conjunction with the US Air Force's \n<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/lib/afissues/1997/app_b_20.html\">Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle</a> (EELV) progam.",
