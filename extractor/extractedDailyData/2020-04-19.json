  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to approach Saturn in a spaceship?\n\nOne doesn't have to just imagine -- the\n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">Cassini spacecraft</a>\ndid just this in 2004,  recording thousands of images along the way, and\n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/raw-images\">hundreds of thousands more</a> since entering orbit.\n\nSome of Cassini's early images have been digitally tweaked, cropped, and compiled into the\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/11386048\">featured inspiring video</a> \nwhich is part of a larger developing\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imax\">IMAX</a> movie project named\n<a href=\"https://insaturnsrings.com/\">In Saturn's Rings</a>.  \n\nIn the concluding sequence, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> \nlooms increasingly large on approach as\n<a href=\"ap090505.html\">cloudy Titan</a> swoops below.\n\nWith Saturn \n<a href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/12acf86ba61a04471095cc6ba2c1de78/tumblr_nrowhptkm41t1cy7no1_500.jpg\">whirling around</a> in the background, Cassini is next depicted flying over\n<a href=\"ap141021.html\">Mimas</a>, with large\n<a href=\"ap100511.html\">Herschel Crater</a> clearly visible.\n\nSaturn's majestic rings then take over the show as Cassini crosses Saturn's\n<a href=\"https://caps.gsfc.nasa.gov/simpson/kingswood/rings/\">thin ring</a> plane.\n\nDark shadows of the ring appear on\n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11141\">Saturn itself</a>.\n\nFinally, the enigmatic ice-geyser moon\n<a href=\"ap090628.html\">Enceladus</a> appears in the\ndistance and then is approached just as the video clip ends.\n\nAfter more than a decade of exploration and discovery, \nthe <a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturn-tour/where-is-cassini-now/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> ran low on fuel in 2017 was directed to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrGAQCq9BMU\">enter Saturn's atmosphere</a>, \nwhere it surely melted.",
