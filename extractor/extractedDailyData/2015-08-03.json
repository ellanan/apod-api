  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe setting had been picked out -- all that was needed was an aurora.\n\nAnd late last August, \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=28&amp;month=08&amp;year=2014\">forecasts predicted</a> \nthat an otherwise beautiful night sky would be lit up with \n<a href=\"ap141103.html\">auroral green</a>. \n\nJumping into his truck, the astrophotographer approached his secret site -- \nbut only after a five hour drive across the rural \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan\">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a>. \n\nWhat he didn't know was that his luck was just beginning.\n\nWhile setting up for the image, a \n<a href=\"http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518\">proton arc</a> -- a rare type of aurora -- appeared.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=101070\">red arc</a> lasted only about 15 minutes, but that was long enough to capture in a 30-second exposure. \n\nAs the name indicates, \n<a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~mystical/Publications/spasojevic2004_arcPlume.pdf\">proton arcs</a> \nare caused not by \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whelect.html\">electrons</a> but by more massive \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton\">protons</a> that \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/\">bombard</a> the Earth's atmosphere following an \n<a href=\"ap111005.html\">energetic event</a> on the Sun.\n\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.greatwatersphotography.com/p366640280/hc6084e6#hc6084e6\">featured image</a>, \nthe yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette,_Michigan\">Marquette</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan\">Michigan</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>. \n\nThe blue and yellow rocks in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhAvpx-t15s\">Lake Superior</a> foreground are lit by a \n<a href=\"http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=lighting.pr_what_are\">LED</a> flashlight. \n\nAlso captured, to the left of the red proton arc, was the band of our \n<a href=\"ap150126.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.",
