  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne of the nearest supernovas of recent years was \ndiscovered late last month in the bright nearby galaxy \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m051.html\">M51</a>.  \n\nIt is visible on the right of the \n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_compare_SN2005-m51.html\">above before and after images</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap050428.html\">picturesque spiral</a>.   \n\nCan you spot it?\n\nThe <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a>, discovered originally by \n<a href=\"http://www.dsi-astronomie.de/Bericht_EN.htm\">Wolfgang Kloehr</a> and now dubbed 2005cs, \nis still near its maximum brightness and visible \nwith a telescope toward the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of the Hunting Dogs (<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=13\">Canes Venatici</a>).\n\nThe supernova has been identified as a \n<a href=\"http://stupendous.rit.edu/richmond/answers/sntypes.txt\">Type II</a> but has an unusual brightness history, \ncreating speculation that is similar in nature to the \nbrightest supernova of modern times: \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/sn87a.html\">1987A</a>.\n\nThe progenitor star has been \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1544_1.asp\">identified</a> as a bright blue star.\n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/RecentSupernovae.html\">hundreds of supernovas</a> are discovered each year by automated searches, \n<a href=\"ap040907.html\">nearby supernova</a> are rare and important because they frequently become bright enough to be studied by many telescopes and are near enough for their (former) host star and immediate surroundings to be spatially resolved.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2005/sn2005cs.html\">Supernova 2005cs</a> may have left behind a core that has been \ncompressed into a \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.umd.edu/~miller/nstar.html\">neutron star</a> or \n<a href=\"http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/BHfaq.html\">black hole</a>.",
