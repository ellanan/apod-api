  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Sun change as it rotates?\n\nYes, and the changes can vary from subtle to dramatic.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WRgXvdasm0\">above time-lapse sequences</a>, \nour Sun -- as imaged by \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> -- \nis shown rotating though the entire month of January. \n\nIn the large image on the left, the solar \n<a href=\"http://solar-heliospheric.engin.umich.edu/hjenning/Chromosphere.html\">chromosphere</a> is depicted in \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html\">ultraviolet</a> light, while the smaller and lighter \nimage to its upper right simultaneously shows the more familiar solar \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/surface.shtml\">photosphere</a> in visible light.\n\nThe rest of the inset six Sun images highlight \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays.html\">X-ray emission</a> \nby relatively rare iron atoms located at different heights of the \n<a href=\"ap090726.html\">corona</a>, all \n<a href=\"http://adsoftheworld.com/files/Blue_Cat-No_Mac-big.jpg\">false-colored</a> \nto accentuate differences.\n\nThe Sun takes just under a month to \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation\">rotate</a> \ncompletely -- rotating fastest at the equator.\n\nA large and active \n<a href=\"ap031027.html\">sunspot region</a> rotates into view soon after the video starts. \n\nSubtle effects include changes in \n<a href=\"ap090405.html\">surface texture</a> and the shapes of active regions.\n\nDramatic effects include numerous flashes in active regions, and fluttering and \n<a href=\"ap100510.html\">erupting prominence</a>s visible all around the Sun's edge. \n\nThis year our Sun is near its \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum\">Solar maximum</a> \nactivity of its 11-year magnetic cycle.\n\nAs <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110701307803962595019/posts/21dVg5ATA67\">the video</a> ends, the same large and active sunspot region previously mentioned rotates back into view, this time \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\">looking different</a>.",
