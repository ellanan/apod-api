  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n \nEach August, as planet Earth swings through dust trailing\nalong the orbit of periodic\n<a href=\"http://www.oarval.org/section3_16.htm\">comet\nSwift-Tuttle</a>,\nskygazers can enjoy the <a href=\"ap070812.html\">Perseid\nMeteor Shower</a>.\n\nThe shower should\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/\n2010/05aug_perseids/\">build to its peak now</a>, best seen\nfrom later tonight after moonset, until dawn tomorrow morning when\nEarth moves through the denser part of the wide dust trail.\n\nBut shower meteors have been spotted for many days, like this\nbright Perseid streaking through skies near\n<a href=\"ap090924.html\">Lake Balaton</a>, Hungary on August 8.\n\nIn the foreground is the region's Church of St. Andrew ruin,\nwith bright Jupiter dominating the sky to its right.\n\nTwo galaxies lie in the background of the wide-angle, 3\nframe panorama; our own\n<a href=\"ap100625.html\">Milky Way's luminous arc</a>, and\nthe faint smudge of the more distant\n<a href=\"ap040131.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>\njust above the ruin's leftmost wall.\n\n<a href=\"http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/\nevent-list.cfm?CalendarDate=2010-08-12\">If you watch</a>\nfor Perseid meteors tonight,\nbe sure and check out the early evening sky show too,\nfeaturing <a href=\"ap100731.html\">bright planets</a> and\na young crescent Moon near the\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2010/08/05/\nskymap_12aug10.gif\">western horizon after sunset</a>.",
