  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to fly past Pluto?\n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> \ndid just this in late July and continues to return stunning pictures of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-pluto-k4.html\">dwarf planet</a>. \n\nSome well-chosen flyby images have now been digitally sequenced to create the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHwnkEIfNgs\">featured video</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/image.php?page=2&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=267\">animation</a> begins by showing New Horizon's approach to the \n<a href=\"ap130708.html\">Pluto system</a>, with Pluto and its largest moon \n<a href=\"ap151002.html\">Charon</a> orbiting a common center of mass. \n\nAs the spacecraft bears down on \n<a href=\"ap150715.html\">Pluto</a> uniquely, surprising surface features are \n<a href=\"ap150713.html\">nearly resolved</a> that, unfortunately, quickly rotate out of view.\n\nNew Horizons then passes just above and near a large, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emaa0gbyJWo\">fascinating</a>, light-colored, heart-shaped, and unusually smooth region now known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombaugh_Regio\">Tombaugh Regio</a>.  \n\nThe spacecraft then pivots to look back at Pluto's night side, seeing an encompassing \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/09171318-spectacular-new-horizons-mvic-haze.html\">atmospheric haze</a>. \n\nFinally, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto\">Pluto</a> \nfades away in a final sequence illustrated with the orbits of many of Pluto's smaller moons.\n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://media.aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EYERMAN_1952_3D_Bwana_Devil_B.jpg\">humanity</a> has no current plans to return to Pluto, \nthe New Horizons spacecraft may well be \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150828\">directed next</a> to fly past an asteroid currently known only as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_MU69\">2014 MU69</a>.",
