  "title": "Full Moon in Earth's Shadow",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLast week the Full Moon was completely immersed in\nEarth's dark <a href=\"ap111215.html\">umbral shadow</a>,\njust briefly though.\n\nThe total phase of the\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/lunar.html\">April 4, 2015</a>\nlunar eclipse lasted\nless than 5 minutes, the shortest total\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE2001-2100.html\">lunar\neclipse of the century</a>.\n\nIn fact, sliding just within the Earth's umbral shadow's northern edge,\nthe lunar north stayed relatively bright, while a beautiful\nrange of blue and red hues emerged\n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/eclipse_gallery.html\">across\nthe rest</a> of the Moon's Earth-facing hemisphere.\n\nThe reddened light within the shadow that\nreaches the lunar surface is filtered through the lower atmosphere.\n\nSeen from a lunar perspective it comes from\nall the sunsets and sunrises around the edges of the \n<a href=\"ap070302.html\">silhouetted Earth</a>.\n\nClose to the shadow's edge, the bluer light is still\nfiltered through Earth's atmosphere, but\noriginates as rays of sunlight pass through layers high in\nthe upper stratosphere.\n\nThat light is colored by ozone that absorbs red light\nand transmits bluer hues.\n\nIn this sharp telescopic view of totality from Auckland, New Zealand,\nplanet Earth, the Moon's north pole has been rotated to the\ntop of the frame.",
