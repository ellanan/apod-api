  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nHow often do stars explode?  By looking at external galaxies,\nastronomers can guess that these events,\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">known as a supernovae</a>, should occur about once every\n30 years in a typical spiral galaxy\n<a href=\"lib/milky_way.html\">like our MilkyWay.</a>\n\nHowever, the obscuring gas and dust in the disk of our galaxy\nprobably prevents us from seeing many galactic supernovae -- making\nobservations of these events in our own galaxy relatively rare.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/\nheadates/heahistory.html#earlier\">in 1572,</a> the revered\n<a href=\"http://www.nada.kth.se/~fred/tycho.html\">Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe,</a>\nwitnessed one of the last to be seen.\n\nThe remnant of this explosion is still visible today as the\nshockwave it generated continues to expand into\nthe gas and dust between the stars.<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/snrs/tycho_image.html\">Above is an image</a> of the X-rays emitted by this\nshockwave made by a telescope onboard the\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/rosat.html\">ROSAT spacecraft</a>.\n\nThe nebula is known as <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/snrs/twotemp_snr.html\">Tycho's Supernova Remnant</a>.",
