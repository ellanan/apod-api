  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happened to the Sun?  \n\nSometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a large \n<a href=\"http://www.opticalres.com/optics_for_kids/kidoptx_p2.html\">lens</a>.  \n\nIn the above case, however, there are actually millions of lenses: \n<a href=\"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/halos/halos.htm\">ice crystals</a>. \n\nAs water freezes in the upper \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">atmosphere</a>, small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals might be formed. \n\nAs these <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystal\">crystals</a> flutter to the ground, much time is spent\nwith their faces flat, parallel to the ground. \n\nAn <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYg5jptvCc\">observe</a>r may pass through the same plane as \nmany of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset. \n\nDuring this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, \nrefracting sunlight into our \n<a href=\"ap100208.html\">view</a> and creating \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parhelia.htm\">phenomena like parhelia</a>, the technical term for \n<a href=\"ap990823.html\">sundogs</a>.  \n\nThe above image was taken \n<a href=\"http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil:V%C3%A4dersoltavlan_cropped.JPG\" late<=\"\" a=\"\"> last year in  \n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm\">Stockholm</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden\">Sweden</a>.\n\nVisible in the image center is the Sun, while two bright \n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/ice/sd.rxml\">sundogs</a> glow prominently from both the left and the right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/halo.html\">Also visible</a> is the bright\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/halo22.html\">22 degree halo</a> -- as well as the rarer and much fainter \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/46hal.htm\">46 degree halo</a> -- \nalso created by \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circular.htm\">sunlight reflecting</a> off of atmospheric ice \n<a href=\"ap080618.html\">crystals</a>.",
