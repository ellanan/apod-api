  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is this strange object?  \n\nFirst discovered on ground based \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/space/linear/\">LINEAR</a> \nimages on January 6, the object appeared unusual \nenough to investigate further with the \n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> last week.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/07/full/\">Pictured above</a>, what Hubble saw indicates that P/2010 A2 is unlike any object ever seen before.\n\nAt first glance, the object appears to have the \n<a href=\"ap071003.html\">tail of a comet</a>.\n\nClose inspection, however, shows a 140-meter \n<a href=\"ap100104.html\">nucleus</a> offset from the tail center, very unusual structure near the nucleus, and no discernable gas in the tail.\n\nKnowing that the \n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=P/2010+A2;orb=1\">object orbits</a> in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt\">asteroid belt</a> \nbetween <a href=\"ap080714.html\">Mars</a> and \n<a href=\"ap080108.html\">Jupiter</a>, a preliminary hypothesis that appears to explain all of the known clues is that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P/2010_A2\">P/2010 A2</a> \nis the debris left over from a recent \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcGjtwpncx4\">collision</a> \nbetween two small asteroids.  \n\nIf true, \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/02/hubble-captures-picture-of-asteroid-collision/\">the collision</a> likely occurred at over 15,000 kilometers per hour -- five times the speed of a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIayrDbVdJ0\">rifle bullet</a> -- \nand liberated energy in excess of a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLFliTyydSs\">nuclear bomb</a>.\n\nPressure from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect\">sunlight</a> would then spread out the debris into a trailing tail.\n\nFuture \n<a href=\"http://transientsky.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/the-curious-case-of-comet-linear/\">study of P/2010 A2</a> may better indicate the nature of the progenitor collision and may help humanity better understand the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\">early years of our Solar System</a>, when many similar collisions occurred.",
