  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe plan was to capture a picturesque part of the sky that was hosting an unusual guest. \n\nThe result included a bonus — an additional and unexpected guest.\n\nThe beautiful background features part of the central band of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way galaxy</a> on the far left, and the \n<a href=\"ap201014.html\">colorful clouds</a> of \n<a href=\"ap190513.html\">Rho Ophiuchi</a> in the image center.\n\nThe unusual guest, a dimmed and \n<a href=\"ap220518.html\">reddened Moon</a> on the right, was expected because the image was taken during last week’s \n<a href=\"ap180128.html\">total lunar eclipse</a>.\n\nThe timing had to be right because \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">the Moon</a> — both before and after eclipse — \nwould be so bright it would overwhelm the background. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/surprised-kitten-opened-his-blue-eyes-what-saw-distance-his-surprise-simply-no-limit-surprised-kitten-127903405.jpg\">unexpected guest</a> was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid#/media/File:Meteoroid_meteor_meteorite.gif\">bright meteor</a> across the image center.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap210315.html\">fleeting meteor</a> streak was \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CdqR1BGNkC7/\">captured</a> \non only one of the 10 consecutively-captured deep-field images from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ub9622tvuUM\">La Palma</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spanish</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a>, \nwhile the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4715932428510939&amp;type=3\">eclipsed Moon image</a> was taken \nimmediately afterwards with the same camera and from the same location.\n\nThe next <a href=\"ap210525.html\">total lunar eclipse</a> — also quite expected — \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2022-november-8\">will occur</a> in early November.",
