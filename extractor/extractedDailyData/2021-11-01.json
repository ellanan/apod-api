  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe dream was to capture both the waterfall and the Milky Way together.\n\nDifficulties included finding a good camera location, artificially illuminating the waterfall and the surrounding valley effectively, capturing the entire scene with numerous foreground and background shots, worrying that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly\">fireflies</a> would be too \n<a href=\"ap210906.html\">distracting</a>, keeping the camera dry, \nand avoiding stepping on a poisonous snake. \n\nBehold the result -- captured after midnight in \nmid-July and digitally stitched into a wide-angle panorama.\n\nThe waterfall is the picturesque \n<a href=\"https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/yanling/zhulian-waterfall-38961944\">Zhulian waterfall</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoxiao_Mountains\">Luoxiao Mountains</a> in eastern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan\">Hunan Province</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>.\n\nThe central band of our \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> crosses the sky and shows numerous \n<a href=\"ap190827.html\">dark dust</a> filaments and \n<a href=\"ap171201.html\">colorful nebulas</a>.\n\nBright stars dot the sky -- all residing in the nearby Milky Way -- including the \n<a href=\"ap170703.html\">Summer Triangle</a> with bright \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzervega20130108.html\">Vega</a> visible above the \n<a href=\"ap210113.html\">Milky Way's arch</a>.\n\nAfter capturing all 78 component exposures for you to enjoy, \nthe photographer and friends \n<a href=\"https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/814/105/215/cat-the-sky-cat-look-the-sun-hd-wallpaper-preview.jpg\">enjoyed the view themselves</a> \nfor the rest of the night.",
