  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOne of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky and similar in size\nto the <a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky\nWay</a>, big, beautiful <a href=\"ap060707.html\">spiral M81</a>\nlies 11.8 million light-years away in the northern constellation\nUrsa Major.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_ngc3031.html\">This\ndeep image</a> of the region reveals\ndetails in the bright yellow core, but at the\nsame time follows fainter features along the galaxy's gorgeous blue\nspiral arms and sweeping dust lanes.\n\nIt also follows the expansive, arcing feature, known\nas Arp's loop, that seems to rise from the galaxy's disk at the right.\n\nStudied in the 1960s, Arp's loop has been thought to be a\n<a href=\"ap100926.html\">tidal tail</a>,\nmaterial pulled out of M81 by gravitational interaction with its large\n<a href=\"ap100324.html\">neighboring galaxy M82</a>.\n\nBut a <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1610\">recent investigation</a>\ndemonstrates that much of Arp's loop likely lies within our own galaxy.\n\nThe loop's colors in visible and\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/\">infrared</a> light\nmatch the colors of <a href=\"ap080512.html\">pervasive</a>\nclouds of dust, relatively\n<a href=\"http://www.galaxyimages.com/UNP_IFNebula.html\">unexplored</a>\ngalactic cirrus\nonly a few hundred light-years above the plane of the Milky Way.\n\nAlong with the Milky Way's stars, the dust clouds lie in\nthe foreground of this remarkable view. \n\nM81's dwarf companion galaxy,\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2008/02/caption.html\">Holmberg IX</a>,\ncan be seen just above and left of the large spiral.\n\nOn the sky, this image spans about 0.5 degrees,\nabout the size of the Full Moon.",
