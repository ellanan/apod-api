  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAlso known as the Cigar Galaxy for its elongated visual appearance,\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m082.html\">M82 is a starburst\ngalaxy</a> with a superwind.\n\n<a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul04.html\">In fact</a>,\nthrough ensuing supernova explosions and\npowerful winds from massive stars,\nthe burst of star formation in M82\nis driving a prodigious outflow.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/m82/\">Evidence\nfor the superwind</a> from the galaxy's central regions\nis clear in\n<a href=\"http://www.imagingdeepsky.com/Galaxies/M82/M82.htm\">this\nsharp telescopic snapshot</a>.\n\nThe composite image highlights emission from\nlong outflow filaments of atomic hydrogen gas in reddish hues.\n\nSome of the gas in the superwind,\nenriched in heavy elements\n<a href=\"ap050813.html\">forged in the massive stars</a>,\nwill eventually escape into\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1183\">intergalactic space</a>.\n\nIncluding narrow band image data in the deep exposure\nhas revealed a faint\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8149\">feature dubbed the cap</a>.\n\nPerched about 35,000 light-years above the galaxy at the upper left, \nthe cap appears to be galactic halo material.\n\nThe material has been ionized by the superwind shock\nor intense ultraviolet radiation from the young, massive stars\nin the galaxy's core.\n\nTriggered by a <ahref=\"ap100324.html\">close encounter with\nnearby large <a href=\"ap130416.html\">galaxy M81</a>,\nthe furious burst of star formation in M82 should last about\n100 million years or so.\n\nM82 is 12 million light-years distant, near the northern boundary of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major\">Ursa Major</a>.\n\n</ahref=\"ap100324.html\">",
