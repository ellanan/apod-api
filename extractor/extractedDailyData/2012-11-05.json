  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does one half of Dione have more craters than the other?\n\nStart with the fact that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>'s moon Dione \nhas one side that always faces Saturn, and one side that always faces away.  \n\nThis is similar to \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">Earth's Moon</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking\">tidal locking</a> \nmeans that one side of \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Dione\">Dione</a> always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit, \nwhile the other side always trails.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29\">Dione</a> \nshould therefore have undergone a significant number of impacts on its leading half.\n\nStrangely, the current leading half of \n<a href=\"ap060905.html\">Dione</a> \nis <i>less</i> cratered than the trailing half.  \n\nA leading explanation is that some crater-forming impacts were so large they spun \n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2034.pdf\">Dione</a>, \nchanging the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the \nmoon's spin again became locked.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/10231223-huge-dione-mosaic.html\">above detailed image</a> of Dione highlighting the moon's subtle hues \nis a meticulously-constructed mosaic -- \nby an dedicated amateur -- \nof pictures taken during the April 2010 \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bVJjrjbvE\">flyby of Dione</a> by NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/spacecraft/index.html\">Cassini spacecraft</a>.",
