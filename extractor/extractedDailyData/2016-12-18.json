  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTo some, it looks like the wheel of a cart.\n\nIn fact, because of its outward oval appearance, the presence of a central \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-are-galaxies\">galaxy</a>, and their connection with what looks like the spokes of a wheel, the galaxy on the right is known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartwheel_Galaxy\">Cartwheel Galaxy</a>.\n\nTo others, however, it looks like a \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">complicated interaction between galaxies</a> awaiting explanation.\n\nAlong with the two galaxies on the left, \n<a href=\"ap060118.html\">the Cartwheel</a> is part of a \n<a href=\"ap070319.html\">group of galaxies</a> about 400 million light years away in the \n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/scl/index.html\">constellation Sculptor</a>. \n\nThe large galaxy's rim spans over 100,000 \n<a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light years</a> and is composed of star \nforming regions filled with extremely bright and massive stars. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1036a/\">Pictured</a>, \nthe Cartwheel's ring-like shape is the result of gravitational disruption caused by a smaller galaxy passing through a large one, compressing the interstellar gas and dust and causing a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">star formation</a> wave to move out like a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9QwiBFN9gI\">ripple</a> across the surface of a pond.",
