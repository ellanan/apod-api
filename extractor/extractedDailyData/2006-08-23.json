  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's causing seasonal \n<a href=\"http://themis.asu.edu/images/subpage/news/polar_2\">dark spots</a> on Mars?  \n\nEvery spring, strange \n<a href=\"ap040831.html\">dark spots</a> appear near the Martian poles, \nand then vanish a few months later.  \n\nThese spots typically span 50 meters across and appear \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_%28implement%29\">fan</a> shaped.  \n\nRecent observations made with \n<a href=\"http://themis.asu.edu/about\">THEMIS</a> instrument onboard NASA's \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/\">Mars Odyssey</a>, currently orbiting \n<a href=\"ap060730.html\">Mars</a>, found the spots to be as cold as the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a> \n(CO2) ice beneath them.  \n\nBased on this evidence, a <a href=\"http://clas.asu.edu/newsevents/\nnewsreleases/2006/GasJetsOnMars-081606.htm\">new hypothesis</a> has been suggested where the spots are caused by \nexplosive jets of sand-laden CO2.  \n\nAs a pole warms up in the spring, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_ice#Solid_CO2\">frozen CO2</a> \non the surface thins, perforates, and begins to vent gaseous CO2\nheld underneath.   \n\nWithin <a href=\"http://themis.asu.edu/news-polarjets\">this hypothesis</a>, \ninterspersed dark sand would explain the color of the spots, \nwhile the underlying frozen CO2 would explain the coolness of the spots.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08660\">Pictured above</a>, \nan artist depicts what it might be like to stand on Mars and witness the \nventing of these tremendous gas and dust jets.",
