  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is Venus surrounded by a bright ring?\n\nSometimes called a \n<a href=\"ap090125.html\">ring of fire</a>, this \n<a href=\"http://www.w7ftt.net/venus1.html\">rare ring</a> \nis caused by the Sun's light being visible all around an object.\n\nUsually seen \n<a href=\"ap191225.html\">around the Moon</a> during an annular solar eclipse, \nthe ring of fire is also visible when either \n<a href=\"ap180204.html\">Venus</a> or \n<a href=\"ap191202.html\">Mercury</a>  \n<a href=\"ap120611.html\">cross the face</a> of our Sun. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Avertedvision/status/1268109604493426690/photo/1\">featured pictured</a> taken last week, though, \n<a href=\"ap200603.html\">Venus did not pass</a> directly in front of the Sun -- \nthe complete atmospheric ring was caused by sunlight \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_scatter\">scattering</a> \naround <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">the planet</a>.\n\nVenus passed within one degree of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">the Sun</a> during its \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/I/Inferior+Conjunction\">inferior&nbsp;conjunction</a>, \nas it moved from the evening to the morning sky.&nbsp;\n\nThe extreme brightness of the nearby Sun made capturing such an image very difficult -- the featured image was only made possible by using a temporary filter to block direct sunlight.\n\nThe image was captured from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oh449g7kas\">Thorton</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire\">Leicestershire</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom\">UK</a>.\n\nThe pervasive \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">blue sky glow</a> \nindicates that the image was actually captured \n<a href=\"ap061030.html\">during the day</a>.",
