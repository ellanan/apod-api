The atoms of gas, stripped of electrons by ultraviolet radiation\nfrom the central star, radiate light at characteristic\nenergies allowing specific chemical elements to be identified.  In \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/13.html\">this image</a>, \nemission from nitrogen is represented as red,\nhydrogen emission as green, and oxygen as blue.\nThe inner edge of the nebula (the direction to the central star)\nis toward the bottom right.  Clearly visible close to the\ninner edge are <a href=\"ap960416.html\">finger shaped \"cometary knots\"</a>.",
