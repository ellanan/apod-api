In the course of a year,\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/Zodiac.html\">the Sun's apparent path</a>\nthrough the sky lies in this plane.\nThe planetary bodies of our solar system all\ntend to lie near this plane, since they were formed from the Sun's spinning,\nflattened, <a href=\"ap960119.html\">proto-planetary disk</a>.\nThe snapshot above nicely captures a momentary line-up looking\nout along this fundamental plane of our solar system.",
