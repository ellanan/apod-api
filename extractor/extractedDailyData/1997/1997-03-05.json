  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Stars are sometimes born in the midst of chaos.\n About 3 million years ago in the <a href=\"ap960708.html\">nearby galaxy M33</a>,\na large cloud of gas spawned dense internal knots which  gravitationally\ncollapsed to form stars.  But <a href=\"ap960816.html\">NGC 604</a>\nwas so large, it could form enough stars to make a <a href=\"ap970214.html\">globular cluster</a>.\n Many <a href=\"ap960903.html\">young stars</a> from this cloud\nare visible above, along with what is left of the initial gas\ncloud.  Some stars were so massive they have already evolved and\nexploded in a \n<a href=\"lib/supernova.html\">supernova</a>.  \nThe brightest stars that are left emit\nlight so energetic that they create <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E456%2E%2E174H\">one of the largest cloud of ionized hydrogen gas known</a>,\nsecond only to the <a href=\"ap960524.html\">30 Doradus Cluster</a>\nin <a href=\"lib/milky_way.html\">Milky Way</a>'s close neighbor,\nthe <a href=\"ap961023.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.",
