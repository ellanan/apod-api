  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOn October 10th, 1846, \n<a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~naw96/lassell/Lassell_by_A_Chapman.htm\">William Lassell</a>\nwas observing the <a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~naw96/lassell/adams-airy.htm\">newly discovered</a>\nplanet <a href=\"ap950817.html\">Neptune</a>.  He was attempting\nto confirm his observation, made just the previous week,\nthat <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html\">Neptune</a> had a ring.\nBut this time he discovered\nthat <a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/neptune.htm\">Neptune</a>\nhad a satellite as well.  Lassell soon proved that the ring\nwas a product of his new telescope's distortion, but the satellite\n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/triton.htm\">Triton</a>\nremained.  The above picture of <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/triton.html\">Triton</a>\nwas taken in 1989 by the only spacecraft ever to pass <a href=\"ap950805.html\">Triton</a>:\n<a href=\"ap960629.html\">Voyager</a> 2.  <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vg2_p34764.html\">Voyager 2 found fascinating terrain</a>,\na thin atmosphere, and even evidence for ice volcanoes on this\nworld of peculiar orbit and spin.  Ironically, <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vg2_1135023.html\">Voyager 2 also confirmed the existence of complete thin rings around Neptune</a>\n- but these would have been quite invisible to Lassell!",
