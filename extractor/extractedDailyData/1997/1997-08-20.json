  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHas Orion the Hunter acquired a new weapon?  \nIf you turn your head sideways (counterclockwise) \nyou might notice the familiar <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html\">constellation of Orion</a>, particularly the three consecutive \nbright stars that make up \n<a href=\"http://www.adler.uchicago.edu/ISE/ORION4.HTM\">Orion's belt</a>.  \nBut in addition to the stars that compose his \n<a href=\"http://www.adler.uchicago.edu/ISE/ORION4.HTM\">sword</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/OrionStory.html\">Orion</a> appears to have added some sort of futuristic light-saber, \npossibly in an attempt to finally track down \n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/constellation/TAU.html\">Taurus the Bull</a>.  \nActually, the bright streak is a meteor from the \n<a href=\"ap970811.html\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>, \na shower that put on an impressive display last Tuesday morning, \nwhen this photograph was taken.  This <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a> was likely a small icy pebble shed years ago from \n<a href=\"ap960219.html\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a> that \nevaporated as it entered \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.",
