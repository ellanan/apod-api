  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nThe largest telescopes in the world have scrambled\nto point toward this faint, fading object.\n\nWhy? Because it may well be the <a href=\"ap970407.html\">first active optical counterpart</a>\never found for a <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">gamma-ray burst</a>,\nand could hold the clue to the distance scale to this most\n<a href=\"http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/astronomy/grb/\">enigmatic class of astronomical objects</a>.\n\n During the past two months, multiwavelength observations,\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/news/news.shtml\">claims</a>,\nand <a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9703181\">counterclaims</a>\nhave been exchanged at a torrential pace, as astronomers wait impatiently\nto see what setting houses the\n<a href=\"ap970319.html\">fading transient</a>.\n\nAbove are two pictures of the <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/10/PR.html\">optical transient</a>\n(OT), one taken on February 28<sup>th</sup>, the other about a\nweek later on March 8<sup>th</sup>.  The OT arrows show the source\nthat faded from view during this time.\nThe <a href=\"http://archive.stsci.edu/\">OT</a>\nhas been examined by large telescopes including the <a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nand <a href=\"ap960715.html\">Keck</a>, yet researchers are still scrambling\nto get answers to fundamental questions about its true nature.\n\nDoes the <a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9703133\">OT</a>\nactually move (exhibit\n<a href=\"http://tycho.astro.gmu.edu/classes/a10696/notes/l06/l06s058.html\">proper motion</a>)?\nIs there a faint galaxy superposed behind\nthe OT or is this extended emission fading too?\n\nIn the face of intense scrutiny with the world's most capable telescopes,\nthe origin of gamma-ray bursts so far remains mysterious!",
