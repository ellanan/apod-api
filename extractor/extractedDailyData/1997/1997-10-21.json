  "title": "The Butterfly Planetary Nebula",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAs stars age, they throw off their outer layers.  \nSometimes a highly symmetric gaseous \n<a href=\" http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary \nnebula</a> is created, as is the case in <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1994ApJ%2E%2E%2E437%2E%2E281H&amp;nosetcookie=1\">M2-9</a>, also called the Butterfly.  Most \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebulae</a> show this \n<a href=\"ap970914.html\">bipolar</a> appearance, \nalthough some appear \n<a href=\"ap970331.html\">nearly spherical</a>.  \nAn unusual characteristic of the Butterfly is that spots \non the \"wings\" appear to have moved slightly over the years.  \nThe \n<a href=\"http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/latter/\">above picture</a> was taken in three bands of infrared light and \ncomputationally shifted into the visible.\nMuch remains unknown about \n<a href=\"ap961203.html\">planetary nebulae</a>, \nincluding why some \n<a href=\"ap970802.html\">appear symmetric</a>, \nwhat creates the knots of emission \n(some known as <a href=\"ap961122.html\">FLIERS</a>), \nand how exactly stars create them.",
