  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nYesterday, July 4th,\nusing its own array of fireworks, a parachute, and a cocoon of\nairbags, the\n<a href=\"http://mars.compuserve.com/default1.html\">Mars Pathfinder</a> spacecraft successfully bounced\nand came to rest\non the surface of Mars at 10:07 AM Pacific Daylight Time.\n\n<a href=\"http://mars.compuserve.com/default.html\">And the news is wonderful</a> - \nthe spacecraft appears to be in good health after having\nperformed its\n<a href=\"ap970704.html\">complicated landing sequence</a> superbly.\n\nAbove is a mosaic of\n<a href=\"http://mars.compuserve.com/ops/other.html\">images from the martian surface</a> transmitted shortly after Pathfinder\nreestablished communication with\n<a href=\"http://mars.compuserve.com/webcams/marsroom.html\">its mission operators on Earth</a>.\n\nThe solar powered, two foot long, 25 pound\n<a href=\"http://mars.compuserve.com/rover/mission.html\">Mars Sojourner robot rover</a> is visible crouched on\nthe unfolded spacecraft.  Surrounding Pathfinder are\ndeflated airbags and a rock-strewn terrain.\n\nIn the distance martian hills appear against a dusty brownish sky.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/imp/index.html\">The IMP camera</a> which produced this view is\nalso capable of stereo images and\npromises further spectacular pictures\n<a href=\"ap970627.html\">from Mars</a>.",
