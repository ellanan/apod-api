  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHale-Bopp may be the \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/news78.html\">most photographed</a> \ncomet in history.   \n<a href=\"http://www.sunrise.it/associazioni/aac/comete/95o10497.htm\">Above</a>, our photogenic giant flying snowball appeared last month as a backdrop to the \n\"Cinque Torri\" Mountains near \n<a href=\"ap970328.html\">Contina d'Ampezzo</a>, Italy.   \nAlthough the comet\n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/news88.html\">is still fairly bright</a>, it is fading as it recedes from the \n<a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a>, and is now\n<a href=\"ap970515.html\">more easily visible</a> from \n<a href=\"ap951222.html\">Earth's southern hemisphere</a>.   \nHaving shed a few meters of ice and rock from its surface, \n<a href=\"http://http.hq.eso.org/comet-hale-bopp/comet-hale-bopp.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> will coast to the outer \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>, and return again in another \n2400 years.",
