  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ftp://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/pao/releases/1997/97-59.htm\">Like cosmic snowballs, fluffy comet-like objects</a> the size of houses\nand composed mostly of water-ice,\nmay be pummeling planet Earth 5 to 30 times a minute.\n\nThis controversial theory was originally proposed in 1986 by\nDr. Louis Frank (U. Iowa) based on data from NASA's\n<a href=\"http://blanc.physics.uiowa.edu/www/desai/\">Dynamics Explorer 1</a>.  It is further supported by\nrecently reported findings from the\n<a href=\"ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/presskit/1996/POLAR_Press_Kit.txt\">one year old POLAR spacecraft</a>.\n\nRepresenting a previously unknown class of Solar System objects,\nthese proposed small, icy comets\ndisintegrate in the upper atmosphere at altitudes\nof 600 to 15,000 miles and so do not pose\n<a href=\"ap960604.html\">an impact threat</a> to the Earth's\nsurface or even\n<a href=\"ap961224.html\">to spacecraft in low Earth orbit</a>.\n\nOn breaking up, however, they produce a fleeting trail of clouds\nof water vapor.\n\n<a href=\"http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/newsroom/flash/flash.htm\">Traces of these transient, extremely high altitude clouds</a> can be\ndetected by down looking spacecraft\ndesigned to monitor the near-Earth environment.\n\nThe suspected trail of one such cosmic snowball vaporizing over the\nAtlantic Ocean and Western Europe at\nan altitude of 5,000 to 15,000 miles is seen above.\n\nIt was recorded in a 54 second exposure by\n<a href=\"http://www-pi.physics.uiowa.edu/www/vis/\">POLAR's Visible Imaging System</a> in September of 1996.\n\nA map has been added as a background for location reference.\n\nIf continuous over the history of the Earth's formation, this relatively\ngentle cosmic snow shower would have been a major source of water for\nEarth's present <a href=\"ap960806.html\">life-nurturing oceans</a>\nand possibly even a source of simple organic compounds.",
