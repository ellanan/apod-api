  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere do \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">gamma-ray bursts</a> (GRBs) originate?  The most powerful \nexplosions in the universe have \n<a href=\"ap970513.html\">recently been located</a> with record accuracy.  \nBut do GRBs occur in galaxies or out alone in deep space?  \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/20/A.html\">This picture</a> \ntaken with the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/HSToverview.html\">Hubble \nSpace Telescope</a> of the field surrounding \n<a href=\"ap970407.html\">GRB 970228</a> might provide a clue.  \nIt appears to show an extended structure to the lower right of the \n<a href=\"ap961123.html\">GRB</a>, which is identified with an arrow. \nMany astronomers speculate that this extended structure is a \n<a href=\"ap970209.html\">distant galaxy</a>, as its colors and subsequent \nsteady emission indicate.  Other astronomers worry that the extended \nemission is variable and so cannot be a galaxy.  Astronomers hoping for \nmore cases to study were rewarded just last Monday with a new, well-located event: \nGRB 970616.  The location of this burst was determined by an unprecedented \ncollaboration involving the tandem use of NASA satellites \n<a href=\"ap970606.html\">Compton</a>, \n<a href=\"http://ulysses.jpl.nasa.gov/ULSHOME.html\">Ulysses</a> and \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/XTE.html\">Rossi</a>.",
