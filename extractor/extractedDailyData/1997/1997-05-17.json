  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis panorama\n<a href=\"lib/sky.html\">view of the sky</a> is really a drawing.\nIt was made in the 1940s under the supervision of astronomer Knut Lundmark at\nthe <a href=\"http://nastol.astro.lu.se/~eva/geneng.html\">Lund Observatory</a>\nin Sweden.  To create the picture, draftsmen used\na mathematical distortion to map\nthe entire sky onto an oval shaped image with\nthe plane of our <a href=\"ap970315.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>\nalong the center and the north galactic\npole at the top.  7,000 individual stars are shown as white dots, size\nindicating brightness.  The \"Milky Way\" clouds, actually the combined\nlight of dim, unresolved stars in the \n<a href=\"ap961212.html\">densely populated galactic plane</a>, are\naccurately painted on, interrupted by\n<a href=\"ap951109.html\">dramatic dark dust lanes</a>.\nThe overall effect is photographic in quality and represents the visible\nsky.  Can you identify any familiar landmarks or constellations?\nFor starters,\n<a href=\"ap970429.html\">Orion</a>\nis at the right edge of the picture, just below the galactic plane\nand the <a href=\"ap961023.html\">Large</a> and\n<a href=\"ap950919.html\">Small Magellanic Clouds</a> are visible as\nfuzzy patches in the lower right quadrant.",
