  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Most star clusters are singularly impressive.\n But <a href=\"ap970128.html\">open clusters</a> <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/xtra/ngc/n0869.html\">NGC 869 and NGC 884</a>\nare doubly impressive.  Also known as \"h and chi Persei\",\nthis rare double cluster, <a href=\"http://www.system.missouri.edu/ics/staff/andy/astrop/dc/dc.htm\">shown above</a>,\nis bright enough to be seen from a dark location without even\nbinoculars.  Although their discovery surely predates written\nhistory, the \"double cluster\" was notably cataloged\nby the Greek astronomer <a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html\">Hipparcos</a>.\n The clusters are over 7000 light years distant toward the constellation\nof <a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/constellation/PER.html\">Perseus</a>,\nbut are separated by only hundreds of light years.",
