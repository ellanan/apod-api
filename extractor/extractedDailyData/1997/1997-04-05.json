  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nThe center of nearby giant galaxy \n<a href=\"ap950913.html\">M87</a> is a dense and violent place.  In\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/press-releases/94-23.txt\">this \n1994 photograph</a> by the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, a disk of hot \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/jpeg/M87Plot.jpg\">gas was found to be orbiting</a> at the center of this massive \n<a href=\"ap960106.html\">elliptical galaxy</a>. The\ndisk is evident at the lower left of the picture. The rotation\nspeed of gas in this disk indicates the mass of the object the gas is\norbiting, while the size of the disk indicates an approximate volume of the\ncentral object. \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/StarCatcher/1stServicing/\nScience94.html\">These observations</a>\nyield a central density so high that the\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">only hypothesized object that could live there</a> is a \n<a href=\"ap970105.html\">black hole</a>.  The\npicture also shows a highly\n<a href=\"ap960306.html\">energetic jet</a> emanating from the central\nobject like a cosmic blowtorch.\nThe jet is composed of fast moving charged particles and has\nbroken into knots as small as 10 light years across.",
