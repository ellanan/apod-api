  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis is what the \n<a href=\"http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/states/states.html \">United \nStates of America</a> looks like at night! Can you find your \n<a href=\"http://www.portup.com/houghton/\">favorite US city</a> \non this image?  Surprisingly, city lights make this task quite possible.  The\n<a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc/news/night_light.html\">above \npicture</a> is actually a composite of over 200\nimages made by satellites orbiting the \n<a href=\"lib/earth.html\">Earth</a>.  Scans were made by the \n<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/\">USAF</a> \nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) \nOperational Linescan System.  The \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/dmsp.html\">DMSP satellites</a> continue to help in the\nunderstanding and prediction of \n<a href=\"ap970819.html\">weather \nphenomena</a> as well as provide key\ninformation about \n<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/\">population patterns</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.darksky.org/~ida/index.html\">city \nlight levels</a>, and even \n<a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc/news/texasok.htm\">rural\nforest fires</a>.",
