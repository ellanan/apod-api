  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHere lived one of the greatest thinkers in human history.   \n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html\">Aristarchus</a> lived on the Greek island of Samos, a small island in the center of the \n<a href=\"http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/STS58/10083809.htm\">above picture</a> \nthat can be identified with a \n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Kristen/samos.gif\">good map</a>.  Aristarchus, who lived from 310 BC to 230 BC, \npostulated that the planets orbited the \n<a href=\"ap960521.html\">Sun</a> - not the \n<a href=\"ap950830.html\">Earth</a> -- over a thousand  years before \n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html\">Copernicus</a> and \n<a href=\"ap960830.html\">Galileo</a> made similar arguments.   Aristarchus used clear logic to \nestimate the size of the Earth, the size and distance to our \n<a href=\"lib/moon.html\">Moon</a>, the size and distance to our Sun, then\nhe even deduced that the points of light we see at night are not dots painted on some celestial sphere but \nstars like our Sun at enormous distances. \n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Kristen/Aristarchus.html\">Aristarchus' discoveries</a> remained truly unbelievable to the people of his time but stand today as pillars of deductive reasoning.",
