  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those white ovals all over Jupiter?  Storms!  \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap960803.html\">clouds</a> can swirl rapidly in raised high-pressure \n<a href=\"ap961127.html\">storm systems</a> that circle the planet.  The \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/europa/p48952.html\">above pictured</a> \nwhite ovals are located near the \n<a href=\"ap960827.html\">Great Red Spot</a>, and have persisted on \n<a href=\"lib/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> since the 1930s.  The \n<a href=\"ap960802.html\">Great Red Spot</a> has persisted for at least 300 years.  \nCurrently, no one knows why ovals last as long as they do.  White ovals are \nconfined to <a href=\"ap970310.html\">circular belts</a> around \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html\">Jupiter</a>, \nbut can interact to cause nearby chaotic cloud regions.",
