The placements of bright young \nblue stars and dark dust lanes also indicate a strong rotating \n<a href=\"http://www.vyne.com/prototype/WEB/askexpert/astronomy.html#acs9\">density wave</a> of star formation.

Because NGC 1365 is relatively nearby, \nsimultaneous measurements of its speed and distance are possible, \nwhich help <a href=\"ap960513.html\">astronomers estimate \nhow fast our universe is expanding</a>.",
