  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://www.weldwood.demon.co.uk/stonehen.htm\">Stonehenge</a> consists of large carved stones \nassembled about 4000 years ago.  \nLong before modern <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/timehome.html\">England</a> was established, ancient inhabitants \nsomehow moved 25 ton rocks nearly 20 miles to complete it.  \nFrom similar constructs of the era, people could learn the time \nof year by watching how the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> and \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/moon.htm\">Moon</a> rose and set relative to \n<a href=\"http://www.bufau.bham.ac.uk/BARROWS/rmy/MapView.html\">accurately placed stones and pits</a>.  The placement of the boulders at \n<a href=\"http://indigo.stile.le.ac.uk/~rug/STILE/images/hier/bi/eng/r2.html\">Stonehenge</a>, however, is not impressively \naccurate by today's standards, nor even by the standards of that time.  \nTherefore, <a href=\"http://icg.harvard.edu/~scia17/lectures/#B\">modern scholars interpret Stonehenge</a> \nas a colossal monument to the \n<a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a> in celebration \nof the predictability of the \n<a href=\"http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sea.jnp/earth.7/seasons.htm\">seasons</a>.",
