  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.interlog.com/~anash/najvs.html\">Jules Verne</a>'s science fiction classic\n<a href=\"gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/153/1\">A Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>,\nProfessor Hardwigg and his fellow explorers\nencounter many strange and exciting wonders.\n\nWhat wonders lie at the center of <a href=\"ap960213.html\">our Galaxy</a>?\n\nAstronomers now know of some of the bizarre objects which exist there,\nlike <a href=\"ap960528.html\">vast dust clouds</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960903.html\">bright young stars</a>,\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-article_query?1993ApJ%2E%2E%2E402%2E%2E173J\">swirling rings of gas</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap970114.html\">possibly even</a> a\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E456%2E%2E194H&amp;db_key=AST\">large black hole</a>.\n\nMuch of the <a href=\"ap950908.html\">Galactic center region</a>\nis shielded from our view in visible light by the\nintervening dust and gas.\n\nBut it can be explored using other forms of electromagnetic\nradiation, like\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/museum/\nexploratorium/emanalysis.html\">radio, infrared, X-rays, and gamma rays</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mrcnh.com/msx/CB/cb03-Im2.htm\">This beautiful high resolution image</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://141.142.3.134/Cyberia/Bima/GalCntr.html#sgr.west.6\">Galactic center</a> region in infrared light was made by the\n<a href=\"http://bradbury.nrl.navy.mil/msx/spacecraft.html#spiritIII\">SPIRIT III</a> telescope onboard the\n<a href=\"http://www.plh.af.mil/gpd/MSX/msx.htm\">Midcourse Space Experiment</a>.\n\nThe center itself\nappears as a bright spot near the middle of the roughly 1x3 degree field of\nview, the plane of the Galaxy is vertical, and the\nnorth galactic pole is towards the right.  The picture is in false color -\nstarlight appears blue while dust is greenish grey, tending to red in\nthe cooler areas.",
