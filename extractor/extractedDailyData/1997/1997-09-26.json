  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow massive can a star get without imploding into a black hole?  \nThese limits are being tested by the discovery of a lone <a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/nstar.html\">neutron star</a> in space. <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/32.html\">Observations</a> by the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/32/PR.html\">released</a> Wednesday, \nhave been combined with previous observations by the \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#X-ray\">X-ray</a> <a href=\"http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/rosat.html\">ROSAT</a> observatory and \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#uv\">ultraviolet</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/\">EUVE</a> \nobservatory for the isolated star at the location of the arrow. \nAstronomers are able to directly infer the star's size from measurements of its \nunblended brightness, temperature, and an upper limit on the distance. \nAssuming that the object is a \n<a href=\"http://www.gti.net/cmmiller/blkmain.html\">neutron star</a> of typical mass, \nsome previous theories of neutron star structure would have predicted \nan implosion that would have created a \n<a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/abholes.html\">black hole</a>.  That this \n<a href=\"ap961114.html\">neutron star</a> \neven exists therefore allows a window to the extreme \nconditions that exist in the interiors of neutron stars.",
