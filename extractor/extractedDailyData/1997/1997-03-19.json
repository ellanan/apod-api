  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nWhat and where are the <a href=\"ap961123.html\">Gamma-Ray Bursters</a>?\nSince their\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/jbonnell/www/grbhist.html\">discovery</a>\nin the early 1970s, nobody has been able to\n<a href=\"http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/astro/batse/foreword.htm\">explain the cause</a> of\n<a href=\"http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/astronomy/grb/\">mysterious flashes</a> of\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/\nbasic/emspectrum.html\">gamma rays</a>\nthat come from seemingly random directions on the sky.\nWorse yet, it is even unclear whether these\n<a href=\"ap961001.html\">high energy explosions</a> originate\nin our own Galaxy or in distant galaxies across the Universe.\n\nUntil late last month, these bursters were known only by their\ngamma-ray flashes - no counterpart had been seen at any other wavelength.\n\nBut on February 28, an Italian/Dutch satellite known as\n<a href=\"http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/scientificase.html\">BeppoSAX</a>\ndetected what may well be\n<a href=\"http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/first/pressrel_12-mar-97.html\">X-rays from a burster</a>, \n<a href=\"http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/first/iaucirc.html#6576\">eight hours</a> after the\n<a href=\"http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/first/grb970228.html\">gamma-ray flash</a>.\n\nThe discovery image is shown above.  Still hours later, using\nthe position provided by this X-ray image,\nground-based telescopes recovered an even better located\nvariable optical source which also seems to be related to the burster.\n\nDramatically, this optical transient has faded now.\nIn its place lies a steady source that appears to be\n<a href=\"ap960628.html\">a dim, distant galaxy</a>.\nDid this Gamma-Ray Burst originate in the distant galaxy?\n\nIf so, it answers one facet of one of modern\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">astronomy's greatest controversies</a>.\n\nIf not, this would not be the first\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-article_query?1988PASP%2E%2E100%2E1233F\">fortuitous coincidence</a> to mislead astronomers.\n\nFuture satellite and ground-based observations will tell.",
