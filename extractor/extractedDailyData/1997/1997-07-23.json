  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was truly a busy sky.  In one of the more spectacular photos yet submitted to \n<a href=\"http://www.phy.mtu.edu/apod/\">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>, \nDon Cooke of \n<a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/soiccnh/lyme.htm\">Lyme, New Hampshire</a> \ncaught the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a>, \n<a href=\"lib/moon.html\">Moon</a>, \n<a href=\"ap970130.html\">Earth</a>, \n<a href=\"ap970403.html\">night sky</a>, \n<a href=\"ap960903.html\">Pleiades star cluster</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> all in one frame.  \nThe first leg of this \"triple crown\" exposure was of the \n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>, taken at 6:55 pm on April 10th 1997.  \nThrough a dark filter, the \n<a href=\"lib/sun.html\">Sun</a> \nappears as the bright dot on the lower right of the image.  \nA second filtered exposure was then taken after the Sun had set, \none hour and 40 minutes later - this time featuring the \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-moon.html\">Moon</a>.  The Moon appears as a crescent superimposed on an \nodd-shaped dark circle protruding into the left of the image.  \nThis shadow is actually a silhouette of a driveway reflector \nmounted on an aluminum rod used to block out the bright moon - so \nas to allow a third exposure, this time unfiltered, of the background night sky.  \nAnd what a beautiful sky it is.  Highlights include \n<a href=\"ap970610.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>, on the right, and the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/m45x.html\">Pleiades star cluster</a>, \nnear the center.  But what, you may wonder, \nis that bright light near the center of the picture?  \nDon't worry if you can't guess: it's a porch light from a house across the river!",
