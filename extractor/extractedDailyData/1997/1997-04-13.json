  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: <a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/Stars/SS433.html\">SS433</a>\nis one of the most exotic star systems known. Its unremarkable\nname stems from its inclusion in a catalog of stars which emit\nradiation characteristic of atomic <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">hydrogen</a>.\nIts very remarkable behavior stems from a compact object, a <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a>\nor <a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/nstar.html\">neutron star</a>,\nwhich has produced an accretion disk with jets. As illustrated\nin this <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/0/images/pretty_pictures_general.html\">artist's vision</a>\nof the <a href=\"http://www.achilles.net/~jtalbot/news/SS433.html\">SS433 system</a>\nbased on <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/osse/hilev/Targets/ss433_20.html\">observational data</a>,\na massive, hot star (left) is locked in a mutual orbit with a\ncompact object. Material transfers from the massive star into\nan <a href=\"ap970115.html\">accretion disk</a> surrounding the\ncompact object blasting out two jets of ionized gas in opposite\ndirections - at about <a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/book/w8s1.html#ss433\">1/4 the speed of light</a>!\nRadiation from the jet tilted toward the observer is blueshifted,\nwhile radiation from the jet tilted away is <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#redshift\">redshifted</a>.\nThe binary system itself completes an orbit in about 13 days while\nthe jets precess (wobble like a top) with a period of about 164\ndays. Are the jets from SS433 related to those from <a href=\"ap970114.html\">black holes at the centers of galaxies</a>?",
