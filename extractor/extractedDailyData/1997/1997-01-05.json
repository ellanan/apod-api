  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: What would you see if you went right up to\na <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a>?\nAbove are two computer generated pictures highlighting how strange\nthings would look. On the left is a normal star field containing\nthe <a href=\"http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/ORI.html\">constellation Orion</a>.\nNotice the three stars of nearly equal brightness that make up\n<a href=\"ap961202.html\">Orion's Belt</a>. On the right is the\nsame star field but this time with a black hole superposed in\nthe center of the frame. The <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html\">black hole</a>\nhas such strong gravity that light is noticeably bent towards\nit - causing some very unusual visual distortion. In the distorted\nframe, every star in the normal frame has at least two bright\nimages - one on each side of the <a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/abholes.html\">black hole</a>.\nIn fact, near the black hole, you can see the whole sky - light\nfrom every direction is bent around and comes back to you. Black\nholes are thought to be the densest state of matter, and there\nis indirect evidence for their presence in <a href=\"ap951102.html\">stellar binary systems</a>\nand the centers of <a href=\"ap961206.html\">globular clusters</a>,\n<a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">galaxies</a>, and <a href=\"ap961125.html\">quasars</a>.",
