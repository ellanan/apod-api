Volcanism is thought to have created the domes, although the \nprecise mechanism remains unknown. \n<a href=\"http://www.eps.mcgill.ca/~bud/craters/venus_image.html\">Venus</a>' \nsurface is so hot and hostile that no \n<a href=\"ap950927.html\">surface probe</a> has lasted more than a few minutes.",
