  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis is what \n<a href=\"http://www.tue.nl/europe/\">Europe</a> \nlooks like at night!  Can you find your favorite European city?\nAlthough not all of Europe is shown, city lights might make this task possible.  \nContinental outlines have been artificially drawn in yellow. The\n<a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc/news/night_light.html\">above \npicture</a> is actually a composite of over 200\nimages made by satellites orbiting the \n<a href=\"lib/earth.html\">Earth</a>.  Scans were made by the \n<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/\">USAF</a> \nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) \nOperational Linescan System.  The \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/dmsp.html\">DMSP satellites</a> continue to help in the\nunderstanding and prediction of \n<a href=\"ap970819.html\">weather \nphenomena</a> as well as provide key\ninformation about \n<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/\">population patterns</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.darksky.org/~ida/index.html\">city \nlight levels</a>, and even \n<a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc/news/texasok.htm\">rural\nforest fires</a>.",
