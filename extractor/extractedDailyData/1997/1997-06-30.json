  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHey Earth, look what I found!  On the way to visiting the  \n<a href=\"http://hurlbut.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Education/intro/minorobjects.html\">asteroid</a> 433 Eros in February 1999, the \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Education/NEARcurrlynx.html\">Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous</a> (NEAR) spacecraft \nflew right by another asteroid: \n<a href=\"http://hurlbut.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Education/intro/mathilde.html\">253 Mathilde</a> last Friday.  \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Mathilde/images.html\">Shown above</a> is one picture from the encounter.   \nMathilde is a \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">large chunk of rock</a> roughly 60 kilometers across that orbits the \n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a> between \n<a href=\"ap970627.html\">Mars</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> \nin the \n<a href=\"http://ispec.ucsd.edu/student-pages/asteroids/\">main asteroid belt</a>.  \nMathilde's surface is very dark and heavily cratered. The \n<a href=\"http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Mathilde/images.html\">NEAR \npictures of Mathilde</a> received so far indicate that the asteroid has \nundergone spectacular collisions, one of which created the huge impact basin \nin the center, which is estimated to be about 10 kilometers deep.",
