  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/ssu/magnetic_carpet.html\">The Sun has a magnetic carpet</a>.\n\nIts visible surface appears to be\ncarpeted with tens of thousands of magnetic north and south poles\njoined by looping field lines which extend outward into\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/\nenglish/wind_and_corona.html\">the Solar Corona</a>.\n\nRecently, researchers have revealed maps\nof large numbers of these small magnetic concentrations\nproduced using data and images from the\n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/\ndescriptions/mission/english/page1.html\">space-based SOHO observatory</a>.\n\nThe above computer generated \nsunscape highlights these effects, \nwith white and black field lines drawn in joining \nregions of strong magnetism.\nA close-up of\n<a href=\"http://seal.nascom.nasa.gov/explore/\">the Solar surface</a> is\nillustrated in the inset.\n\nThese small magnetic regions emerge, fragment, drift, and disappear\nover periods of only 40 hours or so.\n\nTheir origin is mystifying and\ntheir dynamic behavior is difficult to reconcile with present\ntheories\n<a href=\"ap970904.html\">of rotationally driven</a>\nlarge-scale <a href=\"ap970106.html\">Solar Magnetism</a>.\n\n<i>\nIs some unknown process at work?\n</i>\n\nPossibly, but the source of this mystery may well be\nthe solution to another --\n<a href=\"ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/1997/97-256.txt\">the long standing mystery</a>\nof why the outer Solar Corona is over 100 times\nhotter than\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">the sun's visible surface</a>!\n\nThe SOHO data reveal that energy released as these\nloops break apart and interact seems to be heating the coronal plasma.",
