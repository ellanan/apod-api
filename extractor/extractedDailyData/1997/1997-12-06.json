Where does the energy come from?\n\nMany believe\nthe quasar's central engine is a giant black hole\nfueled by tremendous amounts of infalling gas, dust, and stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/35.html\">This gallery of quasar portraits</a> from the Hubble Space\nTelescope offers a look at their local neighborhoods: the quasars themselves\nappear as the bright star-like objects with \n<a href=\"ap971119.html\">diffraction spikes</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/35/A.html\">The images</a> in the center and right hand columns reveal quasars\nassociated with disrupted colliding and merging galaxies\nwhich should provide\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9611183\">plenty of debris</a> to feed a hungry\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a>.",
