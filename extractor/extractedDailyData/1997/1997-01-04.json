  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: The <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">above computer animated picture</a>\ndepicts how a <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/nslens_ul.html\">very compact star</a>\nwould look to a nearby observer. The <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1993ApJ...406..590N\">star pictured</a>\nis actually more compact that any known except a <a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/abholes.html\">black hole</a>,\nso it is only hypothetical. The observer is situated at the <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/gotops.html\">photon sphere</a>,\nwhere photons can orbit in a circle. To help the viewer better\nvisualize the great distortions created by gravity, a map of the\n<a href=\"ap950629.html\">Earth</a> was projected onto the star,\nand a map of the familiar night sky was projected above. From\nhere one can either look down and see <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/nslens_effects.html\">several duplicate images</a>\nof the entire surface of the star, look up and see several duplicate\nimages of the entire night sky, or look along the photon sphere\nand see the back of one's own head.",
