  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the sky itself seems to glow.  \nUsually, this means you are seeing a <a href=\"http://www.athena.ivv.nasa.gov/curric/weather/graphing/clouds.html\">cloud</a> reflecting \n<a href=\"http://www.personal.u-net.com/~kersland/nlc/nlcfaq.htm\">sunlight</a> or moonlight.  \nIf the glow appears as a faint band of light running across the \n<a href=\"ap970517.html\">whole sky</a>, \nyou are probably seeing the combined light \nfrom the billions of stars that compose our \n<a href=\"ap970315.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \nBut if the glow \n<a href=\"ap970825.html\">appears triangular and near the horizon</a>, \nyou might be seeing something called \n<a href=\"http://www.earthsky.com/1996/es960308.html\">zodiacal light</a>.  Pictured above, \n<a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/calendars/StarDateDB.FM$RETRIEVE?value=03/06/1997&amp;field=ScriptAirDate&amp;html=Test+Request+Date\">zodiacal light</a> is just sunlight reflected by \n<a href=\"ap970201.html\">tiny dust particles</a> orbiting in our \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>.  \nMany of these particles were ejected by \n<a href=\"lib/comets.html\">comets</a>.  <a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/StarDateDB.FM$RETRIEVE?value=09/24/1995&amp;field=ScriptAirDate&amp;html=Test+Request+Date\">Zodiacal light</a> is easiest to see in September and \nOctober just before sunrise from a very dark location.",
