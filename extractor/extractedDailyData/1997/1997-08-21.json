  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs this our universe?  Possibly.  It is \n<a href=\"http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/GC3_Gallery.html#fine_struct\">one \ncomputerized guess</a> of how gas in the <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/CosmosCompHome.html\">universe</a> was distributed billions of years ago, at redshift 3, \nwhen the <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/CosmosGoDigital.html\">universe</a> was only a quarter of its present age.  \nUsing supercomputers at the \n<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.edu/\">National Center for \nSupercomputing Applications</a> and assumptions about the \ncomposition and \n<a href=\"ap970614.html\">beginning of the universe</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/GC3_Members.html\">GC3 team</a> \nwas able to <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/CosmosCompHome.html\">reconstruct a hypothetical universe</a>. \nA cube of this universe was cut out and displayed, \nwith each side being about  8 million light years across. \nColor represents temperature of the <a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v483n2/35894/sc0.html\">hot gas</a>.  \nAt the bottom a single slice through this cube is displayed, with \n<a href=\"http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/2.html\">helium</a> \nabundance superposed with a wire mesh.  \nThe small structures appearing here give insight into the \npast and present structure of the \n<a href=\"http://casa.colorado.edu/~mcl/igmproject.html\">intergalactic \nmedium</a>, the matter inhabiting the regions between \n<a href=\"ap970805.html\">galaxies</a> and \n<a href=\"ap961105.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>.",
