Pieces of <a href=\"ap970409.html\">Europa's surface</a>,\nidentifiable above, have rafted to new locations.  Also visible\nare larger areas that are clearly shifted from their original\nalignment.  What could cause this surface shuffle?  One leading\nexplanation is water - oceans of water just beneath <a href=\"ap961120.html\">Europa</a>'s\nice plains.  This discovery again fuels speculation that life\nmight exist far from the comfort of Earth.",
