  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Is our Galaxy this thin?  We believe so. \nThe <a href=\"ap950908.html\">Milky Way</a>, like <a href=\"http://www.psi.edu/esquerdo/891.html\">NGC 891 pictured above</a>,\nhas the width of a typical <a href=\"ap961009.html\">spiral galaxy</a>.\n\nSpirals have most of their bright stars, gas, and obscuring <a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a>\nin a thin disk.  This disk can be so thin the <a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">spiral galaxy</a>\nappears edge-on like a compact <a href=\"ap970208.html\">disk seen sideways</a>.\n The dark band across the middle is a lane of <a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a>\nwhich absorbs light.  Some of the billions of stars that\norbit the center of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n0891.html\">NGC 891</a>,\nhowever, appear to be moving too fast to just be traveling in\ncircles.  What causes this peculiar motion?  One <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995A%26A%2E%2E%2E299%2E%2E657G\">hypothesis is that NGC 891 has a large bar across its center</a>\n- a bar that would be obvious were we to see this <a href=\"ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">galaxy</a>\n<a href=\"ap970125.html\">face-on</a> instead of edge-on.\n\nThis false color picture was constructed from 3 near infrared images.",
