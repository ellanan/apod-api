  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:  \nWhere are the Milky Way's gas clouds and where are they going?   \n<a href=\"ap970119.html\">Stars form in gas clouds</a>, \nand the motion of gas clouds tell us about the\nsize and rotation speed of our own \n<a href=\"ap970315.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\nBut gas clouds are hard to detect - they are\ncomposed mostly of  nearly invisible molecular\n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">hydrogen</a> and \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#helium\">helium</a>. \nFortunately, at least small amounts of heavier gases co-exist, one of them being \n<a href=\"http://www.carsondunlop.com/co.html\">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), \nwhich is relatively easy to detect at radio wavelengths.\nTherefore, over the past decade, a \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/hotimage/milky.html\">team of astronomers</a> have \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1987ApJ%2E%2E%2E322%2E%2E706D&amp;nosetcookie=1\">carefully \nmapped</a> out the molecular sky to unprecedented \nclarity - to about four times previous resolution \nand about eight times previous sensitivity.  The resulting \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~nlopez/minitel/\">map is shown above</a>, \nrescaled and in false color, with dark blue \nbeing relatively low emission.   The band of our \n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/a10696/notes/l18/l18.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nspans the middle. The data have not only helped our understanding of the \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.gmu.edu/classinfo/astr103/CourseNotes/glx_mway.htm\">Galaxy</a>, \nbut highlight a few mysteries too.  For example: \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1993ApJ%2E%2E%2E410L%2E%2E27Y&amp;nosetcookie=1\">what \ncauses the rapid speed</a> of the gas near the \n<a href=\"ap970121.html\">Galactic Center</a>?",
