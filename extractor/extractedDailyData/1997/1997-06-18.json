  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nEarth is not alone.  It orbits the Sun with a small companion: \n<a href=\"http://www.asteroid.yorku.ca/companion\">Asteroid 3753</a>.  \nFirst discovered in 1986 and designated 1986 OT, this five kilometer \nrock was recently found to orbit the \n<a href=\"ap970411.html\">Sun</a> while executing a \nstrange dance with the \n<a href=\"ap960610.html\">Earth</a>.  A portion of the asteroid's \n<a href=\"http://www.yorku.ca/admin/comm/release/index.htm\">complex \norbit</a> is shown above.  As the Earth orbits once, \nAsteroid 3753 follows the yellow line - while also orbiting the Sun.  \nEach time around, however, the yellow kidney-bean traced by \n<a href=\"ap970120.html\">Asteroid</a> 3753 shifts slightly - eventually \ngoing from trailing the Earth to leading the Earth.  \nEvery 385 years the cycle repeats.   \nBecause the plane of 3753's orbit is tilted when compared \nto the Earth's orbit, the \n<a href=\"http://www.asteroid.yorku.ca/units/phas/people/wiegert/3753/faq.html\">two will never collide</a>.  In autumn 1997, \nAsteroid 3753 will pass below the \n<a href=\"ap951222.html\">Earth's South Pole</a> at about \n100 times the distance to the \n<a href=\"ap970527.html\">Moon</a>.  It will, however, be very \nfaint - about 15th \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> - 10,000 times fainter than the dimmest star without\na telescope.\n<a href=\"mailto:asteroid@science.yorku.ca\">Suggestions</a> \nare being taken for a good name for this asteroid.",
