  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: <a href=\"ap961209.html\">Callisto</a>'s surface\nis not without fault.  In fact, an explorer crossing the surface\nof this large moon of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>\nwould need climbing equipment to pass this large, recently discovered\nfault.  The <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/callisto/P48293.html\">above picture</a>\nwas released last week and was taken in November 1996 by the <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/spacecraft.html\">robot spacecraft Galileo</a>\ncurrently orbiting <a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/jupiter.htm\">Jupiter</a>.\n As the <a href=\"ap970108.html\">Sun</a> illuminates <a href=\"ap950906.html\">Callisto</a>'s\nsurface from the left, the <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/callisto/P48299.html\">unusual cliff or scarp</a>\nstands out by the shadow it casts to the right.  This cliff and\nothers were probably formed when a large object collided with\n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/callisto/index.html\">Callisto</a>\nearly in its history.  Of the many visible <a href=\"ap970112.html\">craters</a>\nin the above photograph, the smallest visible is about a football\nfield across, while the largest is more than a kilometer.",
