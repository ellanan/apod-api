  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nIn the last few years, observational astronomy has given humanity\n<a href=\"http://www.obspm.fr:80/departement/darc/planets/encycl.html\">evidence of the existence of worlds</a> beyond the\nsolar system.\n\nSolar-type stars are now inferred to\n<a href=\"ap960131.html\">harbor planets of approximately\nJupiter mass</a> - some residing in temperature zones\nwhich could conceivably\n<a href=\"ap951118.html\">support liquid water</a> and\n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/edu/lifeuniv.htm\">therefore life</a>!\n\nAbove is a hypothetical scene near one such planet\nwhose sun, 47 Ursae Majoris (47 UMa), is very similar to our own.\n\nIn our sky, 47 UMa\nappears as a faint, inconspicuous\nstar below the cup of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Ursa_Major.html\">\"the Big Dipper\"</a>.\n\n(Our own sun would be equally inconspicuous\n<a href=\"http://www.coseti.org\">when viewed from</a> 47 UMa ...)\n<a href=\"http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html\">Astronomers G. Marcy and P. Butler</a> announced the\n<a href=\"http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/47UMa/47UMa.html\">discovery of a planet associated with this star</a>\nin 1996 and reported it to have a mass of\nabout 2.4 Jupiters or more with an orbital period of 3 years.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.empire.net/~whatmoug/Extrasolar/home_47UMa.html\">This artist's extrasolar vision</a> pictures the detected planet,\n47 UMa b, as a gas giant surrounded by a ring of\nmaterial - analogous to our own\n<a href=\"ap970829.html\">gas giant Saturn</a>.\n\nIn the foreground lies a hypothetical moon of 47 UMa b.  \n<a href=\"ap970409.html\">Could such a moon support life?</a>\n\n47 UMa is only 44 light years distant, fairly\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/nearest.html\">close by astronomical standards</a> - yet there is evidence for\n<a href=\"ap961019.html\">planetary systems which are closer</a> still.\n\n<a href=\"http://techinfo.jpl.nasa.gov/WWW/ExNPS/HomePage.html\">NASA plans to explore nearby planetary systems</a> using spaceborne\nobservatories.",
