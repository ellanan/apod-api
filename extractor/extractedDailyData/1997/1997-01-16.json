  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Sometimes the unexpected comes in a familiar\nshape.  In this <a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~johnston/orion/pr.html\">recently released picture</a>,\nthe seemingly familiar teardrop-shaped object just right of center\nis actually <a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~johnston/orion.html\">an unusually situated disk of gas and dust</a>.\n  In fact, the teardrop is about the size of <a href=\"ap961214.html\">our own Solar System</a>\nand is racing against time to condense and form planets. This\ndisk, however, is unfortunate enough to lie in the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~davies/orion.html\">Trapezium</a>,\nwhich is also home to <a href=\"http://www.apogee-ccd.com/trapez.html\">several immense, bright stars</a>.\n These bright stars emit light so powerful it boils away the <a href=\"http://snoopy.gsfc.nasa.gov/~orfeus2/thermo.html\">gas</a>\nand <a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a> in <a href=\"ap961017.html\">planet-forming disks</a>.\nLarge <a href=\"ap960131.html\">Jupiter-like planets</a> will probably\nnever form in this hostile environment, but it is currently unknown\nwhether <a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a>-like planets could\nform and survive.",
