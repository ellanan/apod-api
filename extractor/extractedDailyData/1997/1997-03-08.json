  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Our <a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a> is\nnot at rest. The Earth moves around the <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a>.\nThe Sun orbits the center of the <a href=\"ap960213.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\nThe Milky Way Galaxy orbits in the <a href=\"lib/local_group.html\">Local Group</a>.\nThe Local Group falls toward the <a href=\"ap951113.html\">Virgo Cluster of Galaxies</a>.\nBut these speeds are less than the speed that all of these objects\ntogether move relative to the <a href=\"http://spectrum.lbl.gov/WWW/cmb.html\">microwave background</a>.\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v464n1/5018/sc0.html\">above all-sky map</a>,\nradiation in the Earth's direction of motion appears blueshifted\nand hence hotter, while radiation on the opposite side of the\nsky is redshifted and colder. The map indicates that the <a href=\"http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/papers/localgroup/lg.html\">Local Group</a>\nmoves at about 600 kilometers per second relative to this <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/cosmology/content.html\">primordial radiation</a>.\nThis high speed was initially unexpected and its magnitude is\nstill unexplained. <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995ApJ%2E%2E%2E448%2E%2E488J\">Why are we moving so fast? </a><a href=\"ap960415.html\">What is out there? </a>",
