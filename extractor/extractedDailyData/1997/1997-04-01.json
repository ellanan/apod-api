  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Which is closer: the comet or the galaxy?\n Answer: the comet.  In its trek through the inner <a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>,\nComet Hale-Bopp has passed nearly in front of the <a href=\"ap961009.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>\n(M31), seen on the lower left.  At the time of this picture, March\n27<sup>th</sup>, <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>\nwas about 10 light-minutes from the <a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a>,\nwhile M31 remained about 3 million light-<i>years</i> distant.\n By contrast, light can cross the Earth in about 1/20<sup>th</sup>\nof a second, and light takes about one second to reach <a href=\"ap950629.html\">Earth's Moon</a>.\n Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/hst15.html\">largest comets</a>\never recorded, and although its' nucleus has never been photographed,\nit is estimated from brightness and spin measurements to be about\n40 kilometers across.  In contrast, <a href=\"ap961210.html\">Comet Halley</a>\nin 1987 was measured to be 15 km, and <a href=\"ap960401.html\">Comet Hyakutake</a>\nin 1996 was estimated to be no more than 10 km.",
