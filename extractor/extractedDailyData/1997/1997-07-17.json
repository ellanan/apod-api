  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are these Earthlings trying to tell us?  \nThe above message was broadcast from \n<a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a> towards the \n<a href=\"lib/globular_clusters.html\">globular</a> star cluster \n<a href=\"http://lyra.colorado.edu/sbo/gallery/m13.html\">M13</a> in 1974.  \nDuring the dedication of the \n<a href=\"ap970412.html\">Arecibo Observatory</a> - still \nthe largest radio telescope in the world - a string of 1's and 0's \nrepresenting the above diagram was sent.   \n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/vol1no2/sagan.htm\">This \nattempt at extraterrestrial communication</a> was mostly ceremonial - \nhumanity regularly broadcasts radio and television signals\nout into space accidentally.  Even were this message received, M13 is so far \naway we would have to wait almost 50,000 years to hear an answer.   The \n<a href=\"HTTP://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8506/SETI.htm\">above \nmessage</a> gives a few simple facts about humanity and its knowledge: \nfrom left to right are numbers from one to ten, atoms including \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">hydrogen</a> and \n<a href=\"http://mwanal.lanl.gov/julie/imagemap/periodic/6.html\">carbon</a>, \nsome interesting molecules, \n<a href=\"http://esg-www.mit.edu:8001/esgbio/rdna/landerfinger.html\">DNA</a>, \na human with description, basics of our \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>, and basics of the sending telescope.  \nSeveral  <a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/faq.html\">searches \nfor extraterrestrial intelligence</a> are currently underway, including \n<a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/phoenix/\">Project Phoenix</a> under the direction of \n<a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/phoenix/contact.html\">Dr. Jill Tarter</a>.",
