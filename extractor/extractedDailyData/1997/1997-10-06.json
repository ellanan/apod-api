What other processes were important?\n\nTime will tell.\n\n<a href=\"http://marsweb.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/c10/\naerobraking.html\">From its planned mapping orbit</a>,\nwith four times better resolution, Mars\nGlobal Surveyor's images should provide\n<a href=\"http://www-k12.atmos.washington.edu/k12/resources/\nmars_data-information/mars_overview.html\">answers</a> to these and other\n<a href=\"http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/\">questions about Mars</a>.",
