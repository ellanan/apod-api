  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's still there.  The \n<a href=\"ap970625.html\">optical counterpart</a> \nto the instantly famous \n<a href=\"ap961123.html\">gamma-ray burst</a> (GRB) that \n<a href=\"ap970319.html\">occurred last February 28th</a> \nhas faded - but not completely.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org\">astronomical community</a> \nhad waited patiently for months for the \n<a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a> to proceed far enough along in its \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">orbit</a> so that the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a>'s glare no longer \nruined inspection of the location of this historic flash.  The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/30.html\">above \npicture</a> of \n<a href=\"ap970407.html\">GRB 970228</a>, taken September 5th and \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/30/PR.html\">released just yesterday</a>, shows an \nextended structure in the center that hasn't changed.  \nHowever, the arrow indicates a \n<a href=\"ap970422.html\">point on the upper right</a> \nthat is now \nfive times dimmer than in preceding months.  This \n<a href=\"ap970422.html\">fading point</a> fits a model where the <a href=\" http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/astronomy/grb/\">GRB</a> originated in a <a href=\" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E485L%2E%2E%2E5W&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">fireball</a> across the universe.  \nThe constant brightness of the extended feature indicates \nthat it is not reflected emission from the <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/jbonnell/www/grbhist.html\">GRB</a> and might be the \n<a href=\"ap970625.html\">host galaxy</a>.  Even so, the <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">great GRB mystery</a> is not yet over: \nfor one thing, \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9709067\">how come other GRBs don't appear to occur in galactic hosts</a>?",
