  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nArp 220 is the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E457%2E%2E616H&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">brightest object in the local universe</a>.  But why does it shine so brightly?  \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/postdocs/hibbard/a220/a220.html\">Arp 220</a> \nwas cataloged as a peculiar galaxy in the 1960s.  In the late 1980s, it was discovered to be an \n<a href=\"http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/science/galleries/agn/Arp220_2.html\">ultraluminous \ninfrared galaxy</a> and headed a list compiled from observations with the now-defunct \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/ipac/iras/iras.html\">IRAS satellite</a>.   \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/17.html\">New observations</a> with the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> are quite revealing.   \nPhotos by \n<a href=\" http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/NICMOS/topnicmos.html\">NICMOS</a> in the \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#infrared\">infrared</a> taken in April and released just last week now better resolve the two colliding \n<a href=\"ap970419.html\">spiral galaxies</a> at the center of \n<a href=\"http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/ISO/AandA/I0054.html\">Arp 220</a>.  \nA result of this \n<a href=\"ap951228.html\">spiral collision</a> are fantastic knots of new star formation visible as the bright spots on the above photograph.  Below the \"half-moon\" shaped knot on the right is a massive disk of dust possibly hiding a dying spiral's \n<a href=\"ap970516.html\">central black hole</a>. The bright knot to the left is the center of the other broken spiral galaxy.  The galaxy cores are about 1200 light years apart and are orbiting each other.",
