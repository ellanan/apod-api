  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Does a comet's dust tail always orbit <i>behind</i>\nit?  Since comets rotate, they shed gas and <a href=\"ap970201.html\">dust</a>\nin all directions equally.  Small ice and <a href=\"ap960729.html\">dust</a>\nparticles expelled by the comet, however, are literally pushed\naround by sunlight. The smaller the particle, the greater the\neffect.  When the <a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/comets/charts/aprpm1.jpg\">comet</a>\nis headed inward, sunlight slows down small particles so they\norbit behind the comet.  When the <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/hale_bopp_info.html#orbit\">comet is headed back out</a>\nthough, sunlight speeds them up, so small particles orbit in front\nof the comet.  <a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>\nitself is too big to have its orbit affected by the momentum of\nsunlight. Therefore, since <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/Headline/1995O1.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>\nstarted back out to the outer Solar System two days ago, we can\nexpect the dramatic dust tail <a href=\"http://home.sn.no/~sajaa/hale-bopp/march14-8.html\">shown above</a>\nto shift in front in the coming days. <br>",
