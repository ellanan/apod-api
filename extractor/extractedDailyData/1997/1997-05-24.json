Four\nother moon's of Saturn can be seen just above the ring plane, which are,\nfrom left to right: \n<a href=\"ap950924.html\">Mimas</a>, \n<a href=\"ap951124.html\">Tethys</a>, \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/janus.html\">Janus</a>, and <a href=\"ap951125.html\">Enceladus</a>.  If you look\ncarefully, you will note that the dark band across the planet is actually\nthe <i> shadow </i> of the rings, and is slightly displaced from the real\nrings - which are best seen away from the planet.  \n<a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html\">Saturn's \nrings</a> are not solid - they are composed of ice chunks which range \nin size from a grain of sand to a house.",
