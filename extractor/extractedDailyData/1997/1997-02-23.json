  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nBy chance, a collision of two galaxies has created a surprisingly\nrecognizable shape on a cosmic scale - \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/02.html\">\"The Cartwheel Galaxy\"</a>.\n\nThe Cartwheel is part of a group of galaxies about 500 million\nlight years away in\n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/constellation/SCL.html\">the constellation of Sculptor</a>\n(two smaller galaxies in the group are visible on the right).\n\nIts rim is an\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E474%2E%2E686H&amp;db_key=AST\">immense ring like structure</a> 100,000 light\nyears in diameter composed of newly formed,\nextremely bright, massive stars.\n\n<a href=\"ap951228.html\">When galaxies collide</a>\nthey pass through each other,\ntheir individual stars rarely coming into contact. However,\nthe galaxies' gravitational fields are seriously distorted by the collision.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/Cartwheel.txt\">the ring-like shape</a> is the result of the gravitational\ndisruption caused by a small intruder galaxy passing\nthrough a large one,\ncausing a a star formation wave to move out from\nthe impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.\n\nIn this case the large galaxy may have originally been a spiral, not unlike\nour own Milky Way, transformed into the wheel shape by the collision.\n\nBut ... \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E467%2E%2E241H&amp;db_key=AST\">what happened to the small intruder galaxy</a>?",
