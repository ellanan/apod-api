  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThree dark dust lanes give the picturesque \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m020.html\">Trifid Nebula</a> its name.  \nThe red and blue colors of the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n6514x.html\">Trifid Nebula</a> are present in different regions \nand are created by different processes.  \n\nA big bright star near the center of the \nred region appears white hot and emits light so energetic it knocks \n<a href=\"http://pdg.lbl.gov/cpep/adventure.html\">electrons</a> away from gas surrounding it.  \nWhen an electron is recaptured by a proton, \nred light is frequently emitted.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1986AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E92%2E1125L&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">blue region</a> is centered on \nanother bright star but this region's \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a> reflects light to us.  \nThe two regions are thus called an \n<a href=\"lib/emission.html\">emission nebula</a> and \n<a href=\"lib/reflection.html\">reflection nebula</a>, respectively.  \nThe <a href=\"ap970828.html\">Trifid Nebula</a> can be seen in \n<a href=\"ap971111.html\">Sagittarius toward the Galactic Center</a> \nwith a small telescope.",
