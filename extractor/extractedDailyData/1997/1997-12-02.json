  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOn the far side of \n<a href=\"ap970517.html\">our Galaxy</a>, \ngas clouds explode away from a small \n<a href=\"ap970516.html\">black hole</a>.  \nThis might seem peculiar, as \n<a href=\"http://wonka.physics.ncsu.edu/~blondin/Blackhole/history.html\">black holes</a> are supposed to <i>attract</i> matter.\nBut material falling toward a \n<a href=\"http://www.phy.mtu.edu/bht/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a> collides and heats up, \ncreating an environment similar to a \n<a href=\"ap961125.html\">quasar</a> that is far from stable.   \nIn the \n<a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/grs.html\">above time-lapse sequence</a>,\nmicro-quasar GRS1915 expels bubbles of hot gas in spectacular \n<a href=\"ap971124.html\">jets</a>.   \nThese computer enhanced radio images show one \nplasma bubble coming almost directly toward us at 90 percent the \n<a href=\"ap971124.html\">speed of light</a>, \nand another moving away.  Each of the four frames \nmarks the passage of one day.\nOriginally detected on October 29th, these bubbles have now faded from view.",
