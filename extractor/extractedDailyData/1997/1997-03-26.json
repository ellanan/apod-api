The comet lies\nat a distance of about 120 million miles from New York.\n\nAs bright as this comet has turned out to be, it might have been even\nbrighter.\n\nOn May 6,\n<a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/comethb.gif\">Hale-Bopp's orbit will take it within</a>\nabout 10 million miles of the point in the\nEarth's orbit which was occupied by planet Earth itself\nin early January.\n\nIf the comet had also reached this point in January,\nit would have come almost as close to\nEarth <a href=\"ap960314.html\">as comet Hyakutake did</a> last year.\n\nAt that distance,\nHale-Bopp might have been 100 times brighter than it is now,\nreaching -5th or -6th\n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a>!",
