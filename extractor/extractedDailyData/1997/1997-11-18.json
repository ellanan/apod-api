  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nStart with the constellation of Orion.  Below \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/map/Ori.html\">Orion</a>'s \nbelt is a fuzzy area known as the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n1976x.html\">Great Nebula of Orion</a> or M42.  \nIn this nebula is a bright star cluster known as the \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/m042_more.html\">Trapezium</a>, shown above.  New stellar systems are forming there in \ngigantic globs of gas and dust known as \n<a href=\"ap961017.html\">Proplyds</a>.  \nLooking closely at the above picture also reveals that \ngas and dust surrounding some of the dimmer stars \nappears to form structures that point away from the brighter stars.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~johnston/orion.html\">above false color image</a> \nwas made by combining several exposures from the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.",
