  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: It's a <a href=\"http://www.btny.purdue.edu/Extension/Weeds/NoTillID/NoTillWeedID1.html\">weed</a>,\nit's <a href=\"ap951013.html\">Jupiter</a>, no it's - actually planetary\nnebula NGC 3242. After a star like our <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a>\ncompletes fusion in its core, it throws off its outer layers it\na striking display called a planetary nebula. <a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/W_F_P_C_2/N_3_2_4_2/index.html\">NGC 3242</a>\nis such a planetary nebula, with the stellar remnant <a href=\"ap961203.html\">white dwarf star</a>\nvisible at the center. This nebula is sometimes called \"The\nGhost of Jupiter\" for its similar appearance to the familiar\nplanet. NGC 3242 is much farther away however, than the measly\n40 light-minutes distance to <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>.\nIn fact, by comparing the apparent expansion rate with the actual\nrate determined from <a href=\"http://scruffy.phast.umass.edu/a114/lectures/lec15/lec15.html\">Doppler</a>\nstudies, <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E109%2E2600H\">astronomers have estimated</a>\nthe distance to NGC 3242 to be about 1400 light-years away. The\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/W_F_P_C_2/\">red FLIERs</a>\nvisible near the edges of the nebula remain mysterious.",
