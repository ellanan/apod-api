  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nLocation is everything, especially if you want to see a\n<a href=\"http://www.earthview.com/tutorial/causes.htm\">Solar Eclipse</a>.\n\nThese\n<a href=\"ap970827.html\">fleeting events</a>\nare only visible to those in the path of the Moon's shadow as\n<a href=\"http://planets.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/TSE1998/T98PathDesc.html\">it races across</a> the Earth.\n\nThis path is usually less than 200 miles wide while covering only a fraction\nof a percent of the Earth's surface.  And chances are, much of it will\n<a href=\"ap970316.html\">be over water</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.span.ch/sept2.htm\">This view of the September 2nd eclipse</a> was recorded\nby Olivier Staiger from Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, South Australia.\n\nHe used a video camera \nequipped with a teleconverter and solar filter.\n\nThis Solar Eclipse\nwas a partial one, seen here near maximum\nfor Staiger's location.\n\n<a href=\"http://planets.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEplot/SE1997sep02P.GIF\">The deepest eclipse</a> - almost 90 percent of the Sun's surface was\neclipsed by the Moon - was visible only from Antarctica.\n\nWant to see a\n<a href=\"http://planets.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/eclipse.html\">total eclipse</a> of the Sun?\n\n<a href=\"http://planets.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/TSE1998/TSE1998Map/T98Fig6.gif\">Locate yourself</a> near the northern tip of\n<a href=\"http://planets.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/TSE1998/TSE1998.html\">South America on February 26, 1998</a>.",
