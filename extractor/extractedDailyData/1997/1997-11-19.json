  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nUnusual appendages around bright stars are commonplace, \nbut never seem to be mentioned.  What are they?   First, a <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/telescope.html\">telescope</a> brings starlight falling over a <a href=\"http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/a100/handouts/scopes/scopes.html\">large area to a small area</a>.  To get at this small area, however, \none must go inside a <a href=\"http://proxima.astro.virginia.edu/~pai/Text/tel5p6/subsection4_4.html\">reflecting telescope</a>, and this can only be done with support rods,  \nwhich are right in the view of the \n<a href=\"ap960830.html\">telescope</a>.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.ug.cs.dal.ca/dispproj/interference.html\">wave nature of light</a> causes it to deflect when passing \nnear these rods.  Light scatters away from\nthe original destination point ending up elsewhere and appearing as \n\"<a href=\"http://www.chapman.edu/oca/gallery/artifact.htm\">diffraction spikes</a>.\"   These annoying spikes steal precious light \nfrom the central image and hide light from fainter, more interesting stars.  \nAbove, astronomers are more interested in the \nhalf-circled point near the image center, than the cool-looking \ndiffraction spikes from the bright star at the bottom.  Apparently, that \n<a href=\"http://www.tls-tautenburg.de/research/M8.html\">half-circle \nis a new stellar system forming</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap960127.html\">Lagoon Nebula</a>.",
