  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA false-color\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/xrays.html\">x-ray</a>\nimage inset at upper left reveals emission\nfrom a cosmic jet of high-energy particles, 100,000 light-years\nin length, emerging\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/gb1508/\">from\nquasar GB1508+5714</a>.\n\nAn estimated 12 billion (12,000,000,000) light-years away,\nthis appears to be the most distant energetic jet in the\n<a href=\"ap030520.html\">known Universe</a>.\n\nAstrophysical jets of many sizes seem to be produced in a range of\nenvironments where significant accretion, or infalling matter is\nthought to arrange itself\n<a href=\"ap020927.html\">in a disk</a>, from contracting\n<a href=\"ap991129.html\">star-forming</a>\nclouds to supermassive black holes in active\n<a href=\"ap000706.html\">galactic nuclei</a>.\n\nHere, as depicted in the illustration, the accretion disk\nis thought to surround a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nblackholes_sm.html\">supermassive black hole</a>, accelerating\nparticles to near the\n<a href=\"http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/\nspedlite.html\">speed of light</a> in two jets at right\nangles to the disk itself.\n\nIn the case of\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310241\">this quasar</a>,\nthe jet tilted towards us is visible in\nx-rays as the particles collide with low energy photons from the\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/Footprints.html\">cosmic\nbackground</a> radiation.\n\nThe collisions boost the photons to higher x-ray energies and\nscatter some of them in our direction.",
