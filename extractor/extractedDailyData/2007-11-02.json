  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNarrow band filters and a\n<a href=\"ap060324.html\">false-color palette</a> give these three\nnebulae a stunning appearance against the cosmic canvas of\nthe central <a href=\"ap071020.html\">Milky Way</a>.\n\nAll three are stellar nurseries about\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/5000lys.html\">5,000\nlight-years</a> or\nso distant, toward the nebula rich constellation\n<a href=\"ap070711.html\">Sagittarius</a>.\n\nIn the 18th century, astronomer Charles\n<a href=\"http://messier.obspm.fr/\">Messier cataloged</a> two of\nthem; colorful M8, above and right of center, and compact M20 at the\nleft.\n\nThe third, <a href=\"ap040629.html\">NGC 6559</a>, is at bottom right.\n\nOver a hundred light-years across, M8 is also known as the\n<a href=\"ap060825.html\">Lagoon Nebula</a>.\n\nDivided by obscuring dust lanes, M20's popular moniker is\n<a href=\"ap070813.html\">the Trifid</a>.\n\nIn the composite image, narrow\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/\nabsorption.html\">emission lines</a>\nfrom sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms recorded through the filters, are\nmapped into broader red, green, and blue colors respectively.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures/\nmeaning_of_color/eagle.php\">The color scheme</a>\nwas made popular in Hubble Space Telescope images.\n\nBut for ground-based telescopes, narrow band filters also make it possible\nto reject overwhelming light-pollution and capture\ncompelling images of the cosmos from\n<a href=\"http://mayda.com/astro/Index.html\">urban skies</a>.",
