  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you could see one of the robot rovers currently rolling across Mars, what would it look like? \n\nTo gain this perspective useful in planning explorations, the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/specialEffects/opportunity/\">above synthetic image</a> was produced digitally.  \n\nAbove, a digital model of the Opportunity rover was added to a \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06317\">real image</a> \nof the inside of \n<a href=\"ap040510.html\">Endurance Crater</a> on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> \ntaken earlier by Opportunity itself.  \n\nThe size of the <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/mars-rover6.htm\">six-wheeled robot</a> was scaled to the size of the \n<a href=\"ap041215.html\">tracks</a> that the Opportunity rover actually created.  \n\nIn actuality, both the \n<a href=\"ap040803.html\">Opportunity</a> and \n<a href=\"ap040922.html\">Spirit</a> rovers currently rolling across \nMars each span about two meters and so are similar in \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/mars-rover3.htm\">size</a> to a large rolling \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desk\">desk</a>.  \n\nAlso visible in the image is dark \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3519998.stm\">soil</a>, ancient \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005AGUFM.P12A..06B\">light rock</a> and numerous \n<a href=\"ap040405.html\">small gray pellets</a> known as blueberries.",
