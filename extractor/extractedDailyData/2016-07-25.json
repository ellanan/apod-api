  "title": "Deep Magellanic Clouds Image Indicates Collisions",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDid the two most famous satellite galaxies of our Milky Way Galaxy once collide?\n\nNo one knows for sure, but a \n<a href=\"http://aasnova.org/2016/07/11/a-history-of-collisions-between-the-magellanic-clouds/\">detailed inspection</a> of deep images like that \n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/825/1/20\">featured here</a> give an indication that they have.\n\nPictured, the <a href=\"ap150827.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> (LMC) is on the top left and the \n<a href=\"ap100903.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> (SMC) is on the bottom right. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap130815.html\">surrounding field</a> is monochrome color-inverted to highlight faint filaments, shown in gray.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...825...20B\">featured research</a>-grade image was compiled with small telescopes to cover the large angular field -- nearly 40 degrees across. \n\nMuch of the faint nebulosity is \n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/galactic_cirrus.html\">Galactic Cirrus</a> clouds of thin dust in our own Galaxy,\n but a faint stream of stars does appear to be extending from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud\">SMC</a>  toward the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2434.html\">LMC</a>.\n\nAlso, <a href=\"ap080409.html\">stars surrounding the LMC</a> appear asymmetrically distributed, indicating in \n<a href=\"http://aasnova.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fig4.gif\">simulations</a> that they could well have been <a href=\"http://www.catster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/henry-shreds-toilet-paper.jpg\">pulled off</a> gravitationally in one or more collisions. \n\nBoth the <a href=\"ap070330.html\">LMC and the SMC</a> are visible to the unaided eye in southern skies.\n\nFuture telescopic \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwZQYkaIWaE\">observations</a> and computer simulations are sure to continue in a continuing effort to better understand the history of \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/charting-the-milky-way-from-the-inside-out\">our Milky Way</a> and its surroundings.",
