  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDoes Mars have canals?  \n\nA hot <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate.html\">debate</a> topic of the late 1800s, \nseveral prominent astronomers including \n<a href=\"http://www.lowell.edu/AboutLowell/plowell.html\">Percival Lowell</a> not only \nclaimed to see an extensive system of \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/ceps/etp/mars/percival.html\">long straight canals</a> on Mars, \nbut used them to \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/LowellP.html\">indicate</a> that intelligent life exists there.  \n\nThe relatively close \n<a href=\"http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/planet_view.htm\">opposition</a> of 1894 was used to make drawings \nlike the one digitally re-scaled on the above left.  \n\nThe above map was originally prepared by \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/Antoniadi.html\">Eugene Antoniadi</a> and redrawn\nby Lowell Hess for the book Exploring Mars, by \n<a href=\"http://www.usm.maine.edu/~planet/roypage.html\">Roy A. Gallant</a>.\n\nIn more <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">modern times</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">latest Mars opposition</a> has allowed the \n<a href=\"ap021124.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nto capture a <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/22/\">picture</a> of similar orientation.  \n\nComparison of the two images shows that large features \nwere impressively recorded, but that an \n<a href=\"http://ltpwww.gsfc.nasa.gov/tharsis/canals.html\">extensive system</a> of long and straight canals just does not exist.  \n\n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Satellites orbiting Mars</a> \nhave now shown conclusively that the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">red planet</a> does indeed have surface features \nsimilar to canals, but that these are usually smaller, \n<a href=\"ap010417.html\">curved</a>, and less \nextensive than that previously claimed.  \n\nReal canyon systems like \n<a href=\"http://cmex.coginst.uwf.edu/CMEX/data/VOViews/Canyons/Noctis.htm\">Noctis Labyrinthus</a> are most likely \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997LPI....28.1413T\">cracks</a> caused by surface stress.",
