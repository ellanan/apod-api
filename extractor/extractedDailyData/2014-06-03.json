  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMight this giant pinwheel one-day destroy us? \n\nProbably not, but investigation of the unusual star system \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_104\">Wolf-Rayet 104</a> has turned up an unexpected threat. \n\nThe unusual <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_(toy)\">pinwheel</a> pattern has been found to be created by energetic \n<a href=\"http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/astronomy/stewin.html\">winds</a> of gas and dust that are expelled and intertwine as two massive stars orbit each other.\n\nOne system component is a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf-Rayet_star\">Wolf-Rayet</a> star, a tumultuous orb in the last stage of <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/stellar_evol_feat_912.html\">evolution</a> before it explodes in a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=964NtLhXs-0\">supernova</a> -- an event possible anytime in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future\">next million</a> years. \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~gekko/pinwheel.html\">Research</a> into the spiral pattern of the emitted dust, however, \nindicates the we are looking nearly straight down the \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~gekko/pinwheel/movie_11.gif\">spin</a> axis of the system -- possibly the same axis along which a powerful jet would emerge were the supernova accompanied by a \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/bursts.html\">gamma-ray burst</a>. \n\nNow the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHkMIy6dtJ8\">WR 104</a> supernova itself will likely be an impressive but harmless spectacle. \n\nConversely, were Earth really near the center of the powerful GRB beam, even the explosion's 8,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light year</a> distance \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/03/wr-104-a-nearby-gamma-ray-burst/\">might not</a> be far enough to protect us.\n\nCurrently, neither \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/W/Wolf-Rayet+Star\">WR 104</a> nor GRB beams are understood well enough to know the real level of \n<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/04/martin-rees\">danger</a>.",
