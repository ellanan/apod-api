  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere did these two irregular moons of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html\">Uranus</a> originate?  Last week two \n<a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~gladman/utpress.html\">previously undiscovered moons</a> of the distant gas planet were \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06700/06765.html\">confirmed</a>, \nthe first in irregular orbits.  \nAll fifteen \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/uramoons.html\">previously known moons</a> of \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/uranus.htm\">Uranus</a> \nare 'regular', circling near the planet's equator.  \nMost of these were discovered by the passing \n<a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html\">Voyager 2 spacecraft</a> in 1986.  These <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/science/Oct97/new_moons.hrs.html\">newly discovered moons</a> are thought to be odd-shaped and \nabout 100 km across.  They are considered irregular, though, \nbecause they orbit in odd directions and far from \n<a href=\"ap950816.html\">Uranus</a>.  If Uranus' irregular moons \nhave the same origin as those orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>, \n<a href=\"http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/saturn.htm\">Saturn</a>, \nand  <a href=\"http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/Instructional.Materials/Curriculum.Materials/Sciences/Astronomy/Our.Solar.System/Neptune/\">Neptune</a>,  then they were probably caught from orbits around the \n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>.  Moons like this are discovered by their motion.  \nOne of these moons is \n<a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~gladman/\">shown above</a> \nas the circled point of light moving from left to right.  \n(To stop the movie from repeating, click \"stop\" on most browsers.)",
