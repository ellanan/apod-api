  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is one of the brightest planetary nebulae on the sky -- what should it be named?\n\nFirst discovered in 1878, nebula \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7027\">NGC 7027</a> can be seen toward the \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/constellations/Cygnus\">constellation of the Swan</a> (Cygnus) with a \n<a href=\"ap050413.html\">standard backyard telescope</a>.\n\nPartly because it appears there as only an indistinct spot, \nit is rarely referred to with a moniker.\n\nWhen imaged with the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nhowever, great details are revealed.\n\nStudying Hubble images of \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/n7027.html\">NGC 7027</a> \nhave led to the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...539..783L\">understanding</a> \nthat it is a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXiMWrNC6T0\">planetary nebula</a> \nthat began expanding about \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1418\">600 years ago</a>, \nand that the cloud of gas and dust is unusually massive as it \nappears to contain about three times the mass of our Sun.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/9597685537/in/album-72157635424077786/\">Pictured here</a> in assigned colors, the resolved, layered, \nand dust-laced features of NGC 7027 might remind \n<a href=\"http://mfrost.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/26/oldcamera451.jpg\">sky enthusiast</a>s of a familiar icon that could be the basis for an informal name.\n\nA \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=130826\">leading previous suggestion</a> was the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow#/media/File:Pillows_in_the_corner.jpg\">Pillow Nebula</a>, but please feel free to \nmake new suggestions -- for example, in an \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=180109\">online APOD discussion forum</a>.",
