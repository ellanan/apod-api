  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe star cluster in RCW38 was hiding. \n\nLooking at the \n<a href=\"stellar_nurseries.html\">star forming region</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/showcase/rcw38/caption.html\">RCW38</a> will not normally reveal \nmost of the stars in this cluster. \n\nThe reason is that the \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a> \nis so young that it is still shrouded in thick \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> that absorbs visible light. \n\nThis dust typically accompanies\nthe gas that condenses to form young stars. \n\nWhen viewed in \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/infrared.html\">infrared</a> light, however, many stars in RCW38 are\nrevealed, because dust is less effective at \nabsorbing infrared light.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/showcase/rcw38/index.html\">above representative-color image</a> mosaic of RCW38 taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/overview/about2mass.html#about\">2MASS sky survey</a> in infrared light shows not only many \nbright blue stars from the star cluster but clouds of \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">brightly emitting gas</a> \nand dramatic lanes of dark dust.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1987MNRAS.228..721M\">RCW38</a> spans about 10 <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light-years</a> and is located about 5500 \nlight years away towards the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/vel.html\">Vela</a>.",
