  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThese three bright nebulae are often\nfeatured in telescopic tours of the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sgr/\nindex.html\">Sagittarius</a> and the crowded starfields of\nthe central <a href=\"ap990911.html\">Milky Way</a>.\n\nIn fact, 18th century cosmic tourist\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/\nbiograph.html\">Charles Messier</a>\ncataloged two of them; M8, the nebula below and right of center,\nand colorful M20 at the upper right.\n\nThe third, <a href=\"ap011023.html\">NGC 6559</a>, is left of M8,\nseparated from the the larger nebula by a dark dust lane.\n\nAll three are stellar nurseries about\nfive thousand light-years or so distant.\n\nThe expansive M8, over a hundred light-years across,\nis also known as the <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/\nm008.html\">Lagoon Nebula</a> while M20's popular moniker is\n<a href=\"ap050526.html\">the Trifid</a>.\n\nThis stunning <a href=\"http://www.fourthdimensionastroimaging.com/\nLagoonTrifid.html\">digital view </a> is actually a collaborative\ncomposite recorded by 2 cameras and 2 telescopes \nabout 2 thousand miles apart.\n\nThe deep, wide image field was captured under dark\n<a href=\"http://www.mistisoftware.com/astronomy/Site.htm\">Arizona\nskies</a>.\n\nBoth M8 and M20 were recorded in more detail from \n<a href=\"http://www.fourthdimensionastroimaging.com/Observatory.html\">an\nobservatory</a> in Pennsylvania.\n\nGlowing hydrogen gas creates the dominant red color of the\nemission nebulae, with contrasting blue hues, most striking in the\nTrifid, due to dust <a href=\"ap011228.html\">reflected starlight</a><a>.\n\n</a>",
