  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis old dog is doing new tricks.  On the left is ancient \n<a href=\"lib/globular_clusters.html\">globular cluster</a> \n<a href=\"ap970919.html\">47 Tucanae</a> \nwhich formed many billions of years ago.  \n\nOn the right is a closeup of its dense stellar center by the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/35/pr.html\">released</a> last week.  \n\nCircled are mysterious stars called \n\"<a href=\"http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~ouellet/calgary.abs.html\">blue stragglers.</a>\"  Stars as bright and blue as blue stragglers \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/msblues.html\">live short lives</a>, much shorter than the age of the host \n<a href=\"ap970214.html\">globular cluster</a> itself.  \nBut this contradicts evidence that \n<a href=\"http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/research/gcs.html\">globular cluster</a> \nstars formed all at once.  \n\nAlthough this problem has been known for almost 50 years, \na mass and spin rate for a blue straggler was first <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E489L%2E%2E59S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">published</a> last Saturday.  \n\nThis new information indicates that BSS 19 was rejuvenated by \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">two orbiting stars</a> slowly coalescing , \nand not by a dramatic collision.",
