  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap200321.html\">Cruising through</a>\nthe inner solar system, Comet ATLAS (C/2019 Y4) has apparently\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13620\">fragmented</a>.\n\nMultiple separate condensations within its diffuse coma are visible in\n<a href=\"http://www.irida-observatory.org/CCD/C2019Y4_2020.04.13/C2019Y4_20.04.13.html\">this telescopic close-up</a>\nfrom April 12, composed of\nframes tracking the comet's motion against trailing background stars.\n\nDiscovered at the end of December 2019, this comet ATLAS showed a\nremarkably rapid increase in brightness in late March.\n\nNorthern hemisphere\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/overview/\">comet watchers</a> held out hope \nthat it would become a bright naked-eye comet as it\ncame closer to Earth in late April and May.\n\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-atlas-will-it-become-a-naked-eye-object/\">But fragmenting ATLAS</a>\nis slowly\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2019Y4/2019Y4.html\">fading</a>\nin northern skies.\n\n<a href=\"ap060504.html\">The breakup</a> of comets is not uncommon though.\n\nThis comet ATLAS is in an orbit similar to the\nGreat Comet of 1844\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_near-parabolic_comets\">C/1844 Y1</a>)\nand both may be fragments of a single larger comet.",
