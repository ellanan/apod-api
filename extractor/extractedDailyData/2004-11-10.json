  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy isn't this small galaxy simple?  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.naoj.org/Pressrelease/2004/08/05/index.html\">above image</a> and contemporary observations of small nearby galaxy Leo A were supposed to show it has a simple structure.  \n\nNow Leo A is known to be a \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/D/dwarf_irregular.html\">dwarf irregular galaxy</a> - one of the most common types of \ngalaxies in the universe and a type that is likely a \n<a href=\"ap031117.html\">building block</a> \nof more massive galaxy like our \n<a href=\"milky_way.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nIn general, larger galaxies have \n<a href=\"ap030930.html\">recently been shown</a> to continually eat, \nand be primarily composed of, many of the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/local.html\">smaller satellite galaxies</a> that have surrounded them.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004ApJ...611L..93V\">Leo A's surprising complexity</a> indicates that that it, \nand possibly many \n<a href=\"ap991003.html\">small galaxies</a>, have formation histories \nnearly as complex as large galaxies.  \n\nLeo A spans about 10,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> and lies about 2.5 million \nlight years away toward the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/leo.html\">Leo</a>.",
