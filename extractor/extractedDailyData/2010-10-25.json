  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs there enough water on the moon to sustain future astronauts?\n\nThe question has important implications if \nhumanity hopes to use the Moon as a future outpost.  \n\n<a href=\"ap091118.html\">Last year</a>, to help find out, \nscientists <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVyEOFfv_lo\">crashed</a> \nthe moon-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/mission.htm\">LCROSS spacecraft</a> \ninto a permanently shadowed crater near the \nMoon's South Pole.  \n\nNew <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/330/6003/434\">analyses</a> of the resulting plume from \n<a href=\"ap091008.html\">Cabeus crater</a> indicate more water than \npreviously thought, possibly about six percent.\n\n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002728/\">Additionally</a>, an \n<a href=\"http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/lend.html\">instrument</a> on the separate \n<a href=\"http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">LRO spacecraft</a> that \nmeasures neutrons indicates that even larger lunar expanses -- most not even permanently shadowed -- may also contain a significant amount of buried frozen water.\n\n<a href=\"http://uanews.org/node/34940\">Pictured above</a> from LRO, areas in false-color blue indicate the presence of soil relatively rich in \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/1.html\">hydrogen</a>, \nwhich is thought likely bound to sub-surface water ice.  \n\nConversely, the red areas are likely dry.  \n\nThe location of the <a href=\"ap951128.html\">Moon's South Pole</a> is also digitally marked on the image. \n\nHow deep beneath the surface the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Snow_crystals.jpg\">ice crystals</a> permeate is still unknown, as well as how difficult it would be to <a href=\"http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/60/1/597\">mine</a> the crystals and purify them into \n<a href=\"ap050401.html\">drinking water</a>.",
