  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFainter stars in the zodiacal constellation Capricornus are\nscattered near the plane of\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_635.html\">the ecliptic</a>\nin this field of view.\n\nThe two brightest ones at center aren't stars at all though, but\nthe planets Mars and Saturn.\n\nTaken on the morning of April 4, the\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peachastro/status/1511400884307173380/photo/1\">telescopic snapshot</a>\ncaptured their tantalizing\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/mars-and-saturn-conjunction-april-4-5-2022/\">close conjunction</a>\nin a predawn sky, the pair of planets separated\nby only about 1/3 of a degree.\n\nThat's easily less than the apparent width of a Full Moon.\n\nCan you tell which planet is which?\n\nIf you guessed Mars is the redder one , you'd be right.\n\nAbove Mars, slightly fainter Saturn still shines with a\npaler yellowish tinge in\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/\">reflected sunlight</a>. \n\nEven at the low magnification, Saturn's largest and brightest\nmoon Titan can be spotted hugging the planet very closely on the left.",
