  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes the sky above can become quite a show.\n\nLast week, for example, the \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=21078\">Moon and Venus converged</a>, creating quite a \n<a href=\"ap100516.html\">sight</a> by itself for \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> around the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5DqY_q86xQ\">globe</a>.  \n\nFrom some locations, though, the sky was even more picturesque.\n\nIn the above image taken last week from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, a crescent Moon and the planet Venus, on the far right, \nwere captured during sunset posing against a deep blue sky.  \n\nIn the foreground, dark \n<a href=\"ap080122.html\">storm cloud</a>s loom across the image bottom, \nwhile a white <a href=\"ap040218.html\">anvil cloud</a> shape appears above.\n\nBlack specks dot the frame, caused by a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81wFZavdhPU\">flock of birds</a> taking flight.\n\nVery soon after this picture was taken, however, the birds passed by, the storm ended, and Venus and the Moon set.  \n\nThe Moon and Venus have now separated, although Venus will \n<a href=\"http://www.almanac.com/sun/rise/\">remain visible</a> \nat sunset for the rest of this month.",
