  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could fly over Pluto -- what might you see?\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> did just this in \n<a href=\"ap150715.html\">2015 July</a> \nas it shot past the distant world at a speed of about 80,000 kilometers per hour.\n\nRecently, many images from this spectacular passage have been \ncolor enhanced, vertically scaled, and digitally combined into the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-video-soars-over-pluto-s-majestic-mountains-and-icy-plains\">featured two-minute time-lapse video</a>.\n\nAs your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo\">journey</a> begins, \nlight dawns on <a href=\"ap151214.html\">mountains</a> \nthought to be composed of water ice but colored by frozen nitrogen. \n\nSoon, to your right, you see a \n<a href=\"ap161122.html\">flat sea</a> of mostly \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_nitrogen\">solid nitrogen</a> \nthat has segmented into strange polygons that are thought to have \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JC1ijzmH3U\">bubbled up</a> \nfrom a comparatively warm \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Internal_structure\">interior</a>. \n\nCraters and ice mountains are \n<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sputnik_Planitia_nomenclature.png\">common sights</a> below.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJzKDbnXyH0\">video</a> \ndims and ends over \n<a href=\"https://www-b.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21863\">terrain</a> dubbed \n<a href=\"ap160402.html\">bladed</a> because it shows \n500-meter high ridges separated by kilometer-sized gaps. \n\nAlthough the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image/ames/take-new-horizons-for-a-spin-and-print-your-own-model\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> has too much \n<a href=\"http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Collision-Carts/Collision-Carts-Interactive\">momentum</a> ever to return to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/pluto\">Pluto</a>, \nit has now been targeted at Kuiper Belt object \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69\">2014 MU 69</a>, \nwhich it should shoot past on New Year's Day 2019.",
