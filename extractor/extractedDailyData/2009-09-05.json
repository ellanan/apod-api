  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe expanding debris cloud from the explosion of a massive star\nis captured in\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/e0102/more.html\">this\nmultiwavelength composite</a>, combining x-ray and optical images\nfrom the Chandra and Hubble telescopes.\n\nIdentified as E0102-72, the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nsupernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a> lies about\n190,000 light-years away in our neighboring galaxy, the\n<a href=\"ap071001.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a>.\n\nA strong cosmic <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/\nmedxray.html\">source of x-rays</a>, E0102 was imaged by the\nChandra X-ray Observatory shortly after its launch in 1999.\n\nIn celebration of\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/ten/\">Chandra's 10th anniversary</a>,\nthis colorful\nview of E0102 and its environs was created, including additional\nChandra data.\n\nAn analysis of\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/e0102/index.html\">all\nthe data indicates</a> that the\noverall shape of E0102 is most likely a cylinder that is\nviewed end-on rather than a spherical bubble.\n\nThe intriguing result implies that the massive star's explosion\nhas produced a shape similar to what is seen in some\n<a href=\"ap060625.html\">planetary nebulae</a>\n<a href=\"ap080727.html\">associated</a>\nwith lower mass stars.\n\nAt the distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud, this field of view\nspans about 150 light-years.",
