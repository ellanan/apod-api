  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow massive can a normal star be?  \n\nEstimates made from distance, brightness and standard \n<a href=\"http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys230/lectures/star_age/star_age.html\">solar models</a> had given one star in the \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a> Pismis 24 \nover 200 times the mass of our Sun, making it a record holder.  \n\nThis star is the brightest object located just to the right of the gas front in the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0619.html\">above image</a>.  \n\nClose inspection of images taken recently with the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nhowever, have shown that Pismis 24-1 derives its \nbrilliant luminosity \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0619b.html\">not from a single star</a> but from \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006astro.ph.12012M\">three at least</a>.  \n\nComponent stars would still remain near 100 solar masses, \nmaking them among the more \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_massive_stars\">massive stars</a> currently on record.  \n\nToward the image left, stars are still forming in the associated \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebula</a> \n<a href=\"ap991207.html\">NGC 6357</a>, including several that appear to be \nbreaking out and illuminating a \n<a href=\"ap060507.html\">spectacular cocoon</a>.",
