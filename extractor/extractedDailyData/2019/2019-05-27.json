  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes it's hard to decide which is more impressive -- the land or the sky. \n\nOn the land of the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DiegoRizzoPhoto/posts/2122092341173956\">featured image</a>, for example, the Volcano of Fire \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_de_Fuego\">Volc�n de Fuego</a>) is seen erupting topped by red-hot, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AQR8VQl-s\">wind-blown ash</a> \nand with streams of glowing lava running down its side.\n\nLights from neighboring towns are seen through a thin haze below. \n\nIn the sky, though, the central plane of our \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nruns diagonally from the upper left, with a fleeting \n<a href=\"ap181215.html\">meteor</a> just below, and the \n<a href=\"ap080604.html\">trail of a satellite</a> to the upper right. \n\nThe planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> also appears toward the upper left, \nwith the bright star \n<a href=\"ap180702.html\">Antares</a> just to its right.  \n\nMuch of the land and the sky were \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGh3cCmy5zg\">captured together</a> in a single, well-timed, \n25-second exposure taken in mid-April from the side of \n<a href=\"ap150311.html\">Fuego</a>'s sister \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acatenango\">volcano Acatenango</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala\">Guatemala</a>. \n\nThe image of the meteor, though, was captured in a similar frame \ntaken about 30 minutes earlier -- when the volanic eruption was not as photogenic -- and added later digitally.",
