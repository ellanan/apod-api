  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is there long red streak attached to this galaxy? \n\nThe streak is made mostly of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">glowing hydrogen</a> \nthat has been systematically stripped away as \nthe galaxy moved through the ambient hot gas in a cluster of galaxies. \n\nSpecifically, the galaxy is \n<a href=\"http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/proj/basic/galaxies/spirals.asp\">spiral galaxy</a> D100, and cluster is the \n<a href=\"ap180326.html\">Coma Cluster of galaxies</a>. \n\nThe red path connects to the center of D100 because the outer gas, \ngravitationally held less strongly, has already been \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KGpMC28W42Y\">stripped away</a> by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_pressure\">ram pressure</a>.\n\nThe extended gas tail is about 200,000 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a> long, contains about 400,000 times the mass of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">our Sun</a>, and stars are forming within it. \n \nGalaxy D99, visible to D100's lower left, \nappears red because it glows primarily from the light of \n<a href=\"ap060704.html\">old red stars</a> -- young blue stars can no longer form because D99 has been \n<a href=\"ap180825.html\">stripped</a> of its star-forming gas.\n\nThe featured false-color picture is a \ndigitally enhanced composite of images from Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble</a> \nand the ground-based \n<a href=\"https://subarutelescope.org/Introduction/index.html\">Subaru</a> telescope.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181104916C\">Studying remarkable systems</a> like this bolsters \nour understanding of how galaxies evolve in clusters.",
