  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy do some spiral galaxies have a ring around the center? \n\nFirst and foremost, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_95\">M95</a> is one of the closer examples of a big and beautiful barred \n<a href=\"http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/proj/basic/galaxies/spirals.asp\">spiral galaxy</a>. \n\nVisible in the \n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M95-HST-ESO.html\">featured combination</a> of images from \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/about/\">Hubble</a> \nand several ground based telescopes are sprawling spiral arms delineated by \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open clusters</a> of \n<a href=\"ap180212.html\">bright blue stars</a>, lanes of dark dust, the diffuse glow of billions of faint stars, and a short \n<a href=\"ap181009.html\">bar</a> across the galaxy center. \n\nWhat intrigues many astronomers, however, is the \n<a href=\"ap170710.html\">circumnuclear ring</a> \naround the galaxy center visible just outside the central bar. \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...647.1030S\">long term stability of this ring</a> remains a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...621L...4G\">topic of research</a>, \nobservations indicate its present brightness \nis at least enhanced by transient bursts of star formation. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/messier-95\">M95</a>, also known as NGC 3351, spans about 50,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a>, lies about 30 million light years away, \nand can be \n<a href=\"http://1funny.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dog-telescope.jpg\">seen with a small telescope</a> toward the constellation of the Lion \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)\">Leo</a>).",
