  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nAfter sunset on October 3, some of the Solar System's largest moons\nstood low along the western horizon with\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/jupiter\">the largest planet</a>.\n\nJust after nightfall, a pairing of the Moon approaching first quarter\nphase and Jupiter was captured in this telephoto field of view.\n\nA blend of short and long exposures, it reveals\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nSuite_bergamasque#3._Clair_de_lune\">the familiar</a> face\nof our fair planet's own large natural satellite in stark sunlight and\n<a href=\"ap190926.html\">faint earthshine</a>.\n\nAt lower right are the ruling gas giant and its four Galilean moons.\n\nLeft to right, the tiny pinpricks of light are\nGanymede, [Jupiter], Io, Europa, and Callisto.\n\nOur own natural satellite appears to loom large because it's close,\nbut Ganymede, Io, and Callisto are actually larger than Earth's Moon.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/europa\">Water world Europa</a>\nis only slightly smaller.\n\nOf the Solar System's six\n<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/moons.htm\">largest planetary satellites</a>,\nonly Saturn's moon Titan, is missing from this scene.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/\nthis-weeks-sky-at-a-glance-october-4-12/\">But be sure</a>\nto check for large moons\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/1075/\n10-things-international-observe-the-moon-night/\">in your sky tonight</a>.",
