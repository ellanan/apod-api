  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTonight is a good night to see meteors. \n\nComet dust will rain down on planet Earth, \nstreaking through dark skies during the peak of the annual \n<a href=\"ap180808.html\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>. \n\nThe featured composite image was taken during last year's Perseids from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poloniny_Dark-Sky_Park\">Poloniny Dark Sky Park</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia\">Slovakia</a>. \n\nThe unusual building in the foreground is a planetarium on the grounds of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HpMVwLGwOI\">Kolonica Observatory</a>.\n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/88094/the-perseids-why-is-there-a-meteor-shower/\">comet dust particles</a> travel parallel to each other, the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/\">resulting shower meteors</a> clearly seem to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(meteor_shower)\">radiate from a single point</a> on the sky in the eponymous constellation Perseus. \n\nThe radiant effect is due to \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/64/fa/a3/64faa39143ee4aeff8cce3b7e452f4df--forced-perspective.jpg\">perspective</a>, \nas the parallel tracks appear to converge at a distance, like \n<a href=\"http://en.es-static.us/upl/2010/12/railroad-tracks-converge-shutterstock-e1367591337388.jpg\">train tracks</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=1584\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a> is expected to \npeak after midnight tonight, \nalthough unfortunately this year the \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-perseid-meteor-shower\">sky will be brightened</a> by a near full Moon.",
