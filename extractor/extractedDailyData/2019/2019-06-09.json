  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does the shadow of this volcano look like a triangle?\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_del_Teide\">Mount Teide</a> volcano itself does not have the strictly\n<a href=\"http://mste.illinois.edu/users/pavel/java/pyramid/\">pyramidal shape</a>\nthat its geometric shadow might suggest.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/mtshad.htm\">triangle shadow phenomena</a> is not unique to the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHUZr8ixrRA\">Mt. Teide</a>, though, and is\n<a href=\"ap190310.html\">commonly</a>\n<a href=\"ap080301.html\">seen</a> from the tops of other\n<a href=\"ap110417.html\">large mountains</a> and volcanoes.\n\nA key reason for the strange dark shape is that the observer is looking down the long corridor of a sunset (or sunrise) shadow that extends to the horizon.\n\nEven if the\n<a href=\"https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/olympus-mons.html\">huge volcano</a> were a perfect\n<a href=\"https://ruwix.com/online-puzzle-simulators/\">cube</a> \nand the resulting shadow were a long rectangular box, \nthat box would appear to taper off at its top as its\n<a href=\"ap100804.html\">shadow extended</a> far into the distance, just as parallel\n<a href=\"http://www.hickerphoto.com/data/media/7/train-tracks_9510.jpg\">train tracks</a> do.\n\nThe featured spectacular image shows\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_Viejo\">Pico Viejo</a> crater in the foreground, located on\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife\">Tenerife</a> in the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a> of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nThe nearly full moon is seen nearby shortly after its\n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/2001-2100/LE2011-06-15T.gif\">total lunar eclipse</a>.",
