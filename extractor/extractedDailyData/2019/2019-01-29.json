  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow do distant asteroids differ from those near the Sun? \n\nTo help find out, \nNASA sent the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons</a> spacecraft past the classical \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/in-depth/\">Kuiper belt</a> object \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69\">2014 MU69</a>, \nnicknamed Ultima Thule, the farthest asteroid yet visited by a human spacecraft.  \n\nZooming past the 30-km long space rock on January 1, the \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Galleries/Featured-Images/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=586\">featured</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasappere/46864829471/in/dateposted/\">image</a> is the highest resolution picture of \nUltima Thule's surface beamed back so far.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Jm5POCAj8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2\">Ultima Thule</a> \ndoes look different from\n<a href=\"ap160202.html\">imaged</a> \n<a href=\"ap100726.html\">asteroids</a> of the inner Solar System, \nas it shows unusual surface texture, relatively few obvious craters, \nand nearly spherical lobes.\n\nIts shape is hypothesized to have formed from the \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1080544785780203523\">coalescence of early Solar System rubble</a> in into two objects -- \n<a href=\"ap190103.html\">Ultima and Thule</a> -- which then spiraled together and stuck. \n\nResearch will continue into \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZdoKNHb7aqw?t=15\">understanding the origin</a> of different surface regions on Ultima Thule, whether it has a thin atmosphere, \nhow it obtained its red color, and what this new knowledge of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\">ancient Solar System</a> tells us about the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth\">formation of our Earth</a>.",
