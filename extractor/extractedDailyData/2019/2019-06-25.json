  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo you know the names of some of the brightest stars?\n\nIt's likely that you do, even though  \nsome bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_first_written_accounts\">written language</a>.\n\nMany world cultures have their own names for the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars#Main_table\">brightest stars</a>, and it is \n<a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/about/\">culturally and historically important</a> to remember them. \n\nIn the interest of clear global communication, however, the \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/administration/about/\">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) has begun to designate \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_Working_Group_on_Star_Names\">standardized star names</a>.  \n\nFeatured above in true color are the 25 brightest <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> in the night sky, \ncurrently as seen by \n<a href=\"ap160815.html\">humans</a>, coupled with their \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proper_names_of_stars\">IAU-recognized names</a>.\n\nSome star names have \n<a href=\"https://www.petsworld.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pic-2.jpeg\">interesting meanings</a>, including \n<a href=\"ap000611.html\">Sirius</a> (\"the scorcher\" in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\">Latin</a>), \nVega (\"falling\" in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arabic_star_names\">Arabic</a>), \nand Antares (\"rival to Mars\" in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Greek_language\">Greek</a>).\n\nIt's also likely that \nother of these bright star names \nare <i>not</i> familiar to you, even though familiar \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris\">Polaris</a> \nis too dim to make this list.",
