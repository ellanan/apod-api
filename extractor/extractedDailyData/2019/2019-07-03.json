  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could fly across Titan, what would you see?\n\nTo find out and to better explore this exotic moon of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>, NASA recently green-lighted \n<a href=\"http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/What-Is-Dragonfly/\">Dragonfly</a>, \na mission to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/titan/overview/\">Titan</a> with plans to deploy a helicopter-like drone.\n\nSaturn's moon \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)\">Titan</a> \nis one of the largest moons in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System\">Solar System</a> \nand the only moon known to have a \n<a href=\"ap040810.html\">thick atmosphere</a> and changing \n<a href=\"ap131220.html\">hydrocarbon lakes</a>.\n\nAfter development, building, testing, and launch, \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/science/nasa-titan-dragonfly-caesar.html\">Dragonfly</a> is currently scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/Gallery/\">featured animated video</a> envisions Dragonfly arriving at Titan, \nbeginning its airborne exploration, \n<a href=\"ap130121.html\">landing</a> to establishing a radio link back to Earth, and then continuing on to another trans-Titanian flight.\n\nIt is hoped that \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn3-0a19sC8\">Dragonfly</a> will not only help humanity better understanding Titan's weather, chemistry, and \n<a href=\"ap160307.html\">changing landscape</a>, but also bolster humanity's understanding of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/big-questions/how-did-life-begin-and-evolve-earth-and-has-it-evolved-elsewhere-solar-system\">how life first developed</a> on our young Earth.",
