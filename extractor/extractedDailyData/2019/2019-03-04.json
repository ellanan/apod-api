  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis was a sunrise to remember.\n\nAbout a month ago, just before the \n<a href=\"ap180501.html\">dawn of the Sun</a>, an \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RqcOjg-EHgk/hqdefault.jpg\">impressive alignment</a> of celestial objects was on display to the east.\n\nPictured, brightest and closest to the horizon, is \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">the Moon</a>.\n\nThe Moon's orange glow is caused by the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">scattering away of blue light</a> by the intervening atmosphere.\n\nNext brightest and next closest to the horizon is the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">planet Venus</a>. \n\nCompared to \n<a href=\"https://trek.nasa.gov/moon/\">the Moon</a>, \nVenus appears more blue -- as can (also) be seen in its reflection from the water.\n\nNext up is \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a>, while the bright object above Jupiter is the star \n<a href=\"ap180702.html\">Antares</a>. \n\nAlthough this display was visible from almost anywhere on \n<a href=\"https://www.rd.com/culture/unsolved-mysteries-planet-earth/\">planet Earth</a>, the featured image was taken along a \n<a href=\"https://c8.alamy.com/comp/PKA7CF/rocky-coastline-with-a-natural-arch-at-punta-asparano-near-siracusa-PKA7CF.jpg\">picturesque seashore</a> near the city of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily\">Syracuse</a>, \non the island of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily\">Sicily</a>, \nin the country of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight\">This month</a> \nSaturn appears between Venus and Jupiter before sunrise, while \n<a href=\"ap180709.html\">Mars</a> is visible just after sunset.",
