  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does our region of the Universe look like?\n\nSince galaxies are so spread out over the sky, and since our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> blocks part of the distant sky, it has been hard to tell.\n\nA <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880...24T/abstract\">new map has been made</a>, however, using large-scale galaxy motions to infer what massive objects must be gravitating in the \n<a href=\"ap110614.html\">nearby universe</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/local_void/\">featured map</a>, spanning over 600 million light years on a side, shows that our Milky Way Galaxy is on the edge of the \n<a href=\"ap150804.html\">Virgo Cluster of Galaxies</a>, \nwhich is connected to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor\">Great Attractor</a> -- an even larger grouping of galaxies.\n\nAlso nearby are the massive \n<a href=\"ap180326.html\">Coma Cluster</a> and the extensive \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus-Pisces_Supercluster\">Perseus-Pisces Supercluster</a>.\n\nConversely, we are also on the edge of \nhuge region nearly empty of galaxies known as the Local Void. \n\nThe repulsive push by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Void\">Local Void</a> \ncombined with the gravitational pull toward the elevated galaxy density on the other side of the sky explains part of the \n<a href=\"ap140615.html\">mysteriously high speed</a> our Galaxy has relative to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background\">cosmic microwave background</a> -- but not all. \n\nTo explore the local \n<a href=\"ap180508.html\">universe</a> yourself, as determined by \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01765\">Cosmicflows-3</a>, \nyou are invited to zoom in and spin around \n<a href=\"https://skfb.ly/6KP9Z\">this interactive 3D visualization</a>.",
