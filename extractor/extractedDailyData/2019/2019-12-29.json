  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf this is Saturn, where are the rings?  \n\nWhen Saturn's \"appendages\" \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/18mar_saturn\">disappeared</a> in 1612, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei\">Galileo</a> \ndid not understand why.   \n\nLater that century, it became understood that \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>'s \nunusual protrusions were rings and that when the \n<a href=\"ap950801.html\">Earth crosses the ring plane</a>, \nthe edge-on rings will \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaTAYOpUP6o\">appear to disappear</a>.  \n\nThis is because Saturn's rings are confined to a <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/108-How-large-are-Saturn-s-rings\">plane many times thinner</a>, in proportion, than a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor\">razor blade</a>.  \n\nIn modern times, the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn frequently crossed \n<a href=\"ap040117.html\">Saturn's ring</a> plane during its mission to Saturn, \nfrom 2004 to 2017.  \n\nA series of plane crossing images from 2005 February \nwas dug out of the vast \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/raw-images/raw-image-viewer/\">online Cassini raw image</a> archive by interested Spanish amateur \nFernando Garcia Navarro.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2005/05/31/saturn_sans_rings.html\">Pictured here</a>, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, \nis the striking result.  \n\n<a href=\"ap080720.html\">Saturn's thin ring plane</a> \nappears in blue, bands and clouds in \n<a href=\"ap041102.html\">Saturn's upper atmosphere</a> \nappear in gold.\n\nDetails of Saturn's rings can be seen in the high \n<a href=\"ap090901.html\">dark shadows</a> across the top of this image, \ntaken back in 2005.\n\nThe moons \n<a href=\"ap121105.html\">Dione</a> and \n<a href=\"ap180701.html\">Enceladus</a> appear as \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=18340&amp;p=230228#p230227\">bumps in the rings</a>.",
