  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAt the end of last year's northern summer, after its dazzling\n<a href=\"ap180709.html\">opposition, Mars</a>\nstill shone brightly in the night.\n\nThe celestial beacon easily attracted the attention\nof these two <a href=\"ap181013.html\">night skygazers</a> who\nstood still for just a while, but long enough to be captured\nin the sea and night skyscape from Big Sur, planet Earth.\n\nIts central bulge near the southwestern horizon,\nthe Milky Way runs through the scene too,\nwhile the long exposure also reveals a faint blue bioluminescence\nblooming in the waves along Pfeiffer Beach.\n\nNow much fainter, Mars can be spotted near\nthe western horizon after sunset, but\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2454/\nwhats-up-june-2019-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/\">this month Jupiter</a>\nis near its closest and brightest,\nreaching its own opposition on June 10.\n\nNight <a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/\njupiter-is-outstanding-at-opposition/\">skygazers can spot\nbrilliant Jupiter</a> over southern horizons,\n<a href=\"ap190607.html\">glaring next to</a> the stars toward\nthe central Milky Way.",
