  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAdmire the beauty but fear the beast. \n\nThe beauty is the \n<a href=\"ap120430.html\">aurora overhead</a>, \nhere taking the form of great green \n<a href=\"https://originalbeauty.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/spirals-in-nature/\">spiral</a>, seen between picturesque clouds with \nthe bright Moon to the side and stars in the background. \n\nThe beast is the wave of charged particles that creates the \n<a href=\"ap960527.html\">aurora</a> but might, one day, impair civilization.\n\nIn 1859, following notable auroras seen all across the globe, \na pulse of charged particles from a \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml\">coronal mass ejection</a> (CME) associated with a \n<a href=\"ap031029.html\">solar flare</a> \nimpacted Earth's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere\">magnetosphere</a> \nso forcefully that they created the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859\">Carrington Event</a>.\n\nA relatively direct path between \nthe Sun and the Earth might have been cleared by a preceding \n<a href=\"ap160110.html\">CME</a>. \n\nWhat is sure is that the Carrington Event compressed the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/Earths-magneticfieldlines-dipole.html\">Earth's magnetic field</a> so violently that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction\">currents were created</a> in telegraph wires so great that many wires sparked and gave \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy#Electrical_telegraphs\">telegraph</a> operators shocks.\n\nWere a \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/02may_superstorm/\">Carrington-class</a> event to impact the Earth today, speculation holds that \n<a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/03/110302-solar-flares-sun-storms-earth-danger-carrington-event-science/\">damage might occur</a> \nto global power grids and electronics on a scale never yet experienced.\n\nThe featured aurora was imaged in 2016 over \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvallavatn\">Thingvallavatn</a> Lake in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a>, \na lake that partly fills a fault that \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhu2umi0QII\">divides</a> \nEarth's large Eurasian and North American \n<a href=\"http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/tectonic.gif\">tectonic plates</a>.",
