  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat do birds do during a total solar eclipse?\n\nDarkness descends more quickly in a total eclipse than during sunset, but returns just as quickly -- and \n<a href=\"http://www.lazerhorse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Potoo-weird-funny-bird-big-eyes-stare.jpg\">perhaps unexpectedly</a>  \nto the avians -- just a few minutes later.\n\nStories about the unusual behavior of birds during eclipses have been \n<a href=\"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/history-science-technology-and-medicine/history-science/how-did-18th-century-people-react-eclipses\">told for centuries</a>, but bird reactions were recorded and studied systematically by citizen scientists participating in an \n<a href=\"https://ebird.org/home\">eBird</a> \nproject during the \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/solar.html\">total solar eclipse</a> that crossed the USA in \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/\">2017 August</a>. \n\nAlthough some \n<a href=\"https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/28974724/surprised-ownls\">unusual behaviors</a> were observed, many \n<a href=\"http://birdcast.info/forecast/eclipse/\">observers noted</a> birds acting like it was dusk and \neither landing or flying low to the ground. \n\nRadar confirmed a significant decrease in \nhigh-flying birds and insects during and just after totality. \n\nConversely, several sightings of normally \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nocturnal_birds\">nocturnal birds</a> were reported. \n\nPictured, a \n<a href=\"ap140430.html\">flock of birds</a> in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrIyCHXoU0U\">La Serena</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a> \nflew through the air together during the total solar eclipse that crossed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America\">South America</a> last week.\n\nThe photographer captured the scene in frames from an \n<a href=\"image/1907/BirdsEclipseVideo_Caldas.mp4\">eclipse video</a>. \n\nThe next total solar eclipse in \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEplot/SEplot2001/SE2020Dec14T.GIF\">2020 December</a> will also cross South America, while in \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEplot/SEplot2001/SE2024Apr08T.GIF\">2024 April</a> a total solar eclipse will cross \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a> from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\">Mexico</a> through \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England#/media/File:New_England_USA.svg\">New England</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.",
