Whitney,\nfrom along the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_Trail\">John Muir Trail</a>\ntoward rugged peaks of planet Earth's Sierra Nevada mountain range.\n\nAbove the horizon a faint pinkish band of back scattered sunlight,\nthe anti-twilight arch or\n<a href=\"ap060615.html\">Belt of Venus</a>,\nborders the falling grey shadow of Earth itself.\n\nSubtle bands of light across the clear sky are anti-crepuscular rays,\ndefined by\n<a href=\"https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/photo.pl?mission=ISS029&amp;roll=E&amp;frame=31270\">shadows of clouds</a> near the sunward horizon.\n\nActually following parallel lines\nthey seem to converge along the horizon at the point opposite\nthe rising Sun due to perspective.",
