  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/lmc.html\">The Large\nMagellanic Cloud</a> (LMC) is an alluring sight in southern skies.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cielaustral.com/galerie/photo95.htm\">But this\ndeep and detailed telescopic view, over 10 months in the\nmaking, goes beyond</a> what is visible to most\n<a href=\"ap150827.html\">circumnavigators</a> of planet Earth.\n\nSpanning over 5 degrees or 10 full moons,\nthe 4x4 panel mosaic was constructed from 3900 frames with a total of\n1,060 hours of exposure time in both broadband and narrowband filters.\n\nThe narrowband filters are designed to transmit only light\nemitted by sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n\nIonized by energetic starlight, the atoms emit their\ncharacteristic light as electrons are\nrecaptured and the atoms transition to a lower energy state.\n\nAs a result, in this image the LMC seems covered with\nits own clouds of <a href=\"ap051223.html\">ionized gas</a>\nsurrounding its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/\nimage_feature_1190.html\">massive, young stars</a>.\n\nSculpted by the strong stellar winds and ultraviolet radiation,\nthe glowing clouds, dominated by emission from hydrogen, are known as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region\">H II</a>\n(ionized hydrogen) regions.\n\nItself composed of many overlapping H II regions,\nthe <a href=\"ap060106.html\">Tarantula Nebula</a>\nis the large star forming region at the left.\n\nThe largest satellite of our Milky Way Galaxy, the LMC is about\n15,000 light-years across and lies a mere 160,000 light-years away\ntoward the constellation Dorado.",
