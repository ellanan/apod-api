  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created this unusual explosion?\n\nThree weeks ago, gravitational wave detectors in the USA and Europe -- the \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.org/science/faq.php\">LIGO</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_interferometer\">Virgo</a> detectors -- detected a burst of gravitational radiation that had the \n<a href=\"ap160211.html\">oscillating pattern</a> \nexpected when a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes\">black hole</a> destroys a \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/neutron_stars.html\">neutron star</a>. \n\nOne object in \n<a href=\"https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/25333.gcn3\">event S190814bv</a> was best fit with a mass greater than five times the mass of the Sun -- making it a good candidate for a black hole, while the other object appeared to have a mass less than three times the mass of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a> -- \nmaking it a good candidate for a neutron star.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-gravitational-waves-first-black-hole-swallowing-neutron-star\">No similar event</a> had been detected with gravitational waves before. \n\nUnfortunately, no light was seen from \n<a href=\"https://anu.prezly.com/scientists-detect-a-black-hole-swallowing-a-neutron-star-like-pac-man\">this explosion</a>, \nlight that might have been triggered by the disrupting \n<a href=\"ap170501.html\">neutron star</a>.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that the lower mass object was also a black hole, even though no clear example of a black hole with such a low mass is known.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/blackhole_meal.html\">featured video</a> was created to illustrate a previously suspected \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole\">black hole</a> - neutron star collision detected in light in 2005, specifically gamma-rays from the burst \n<a href=\"http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/grb050724.html\">GRB 050724</a>.\n\nThe animated video starts with a foreground \nneutron star orbiting a black hole surrounded by an \n<a href=\"ap190820.html\">accretion disk</a>.\n\nThe black hole's gravity then shreds the neutron star, creating a jet as debris falls into the black hole.\n\n<a href=\"https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190814bv/\">S190814bv</a> \nwill continue to be researched, with clues about the nature of the objects involved possibly coming from future detections of similar systems.",
