  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow do violent stars affect their surroundings?\n\nTo help find out, astronomers created a 48-frame high-resolution, \ncontrolled-color panorama of the center of the \n<a href=\"ap040517.html\">Carina Nebula</a>, \none of the largest star forming regions on the night sky.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/image/2099/news_release/2007-16\">featured image</a>, taken in 2007, \nwas the most detailed image of the Carina Nebula yet taken. \n\nCataloged as NGC 3372, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula\">Carina Nebula</a> is home to streams of hot gas, pools of cool gas, knots of dark globules, and pillars of dense dusty interstellar matter.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap160814.html\">Keyhole Nebula</a>, \nvisible left of center, houses several of the most \n<a href=\"ap190220.html\">massive star</a>s known. \n\nThese large and \n<a href=\"ap170815.html\">violent stars</a> likely formed in dark globules and continually reshape the nebula with their \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">energetic light</a>, outflowing \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">stellar winds</a>, \nand ultimately by ending their lives in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTyMffjKTTo\">supernova explosion</a>s. \n\nVisible to the unaided eye, the \n<a href=\"ap160323.html\">entire Carina Nebula</a> spans over 450 \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> and lies about 8,500 light-years \naway toward the constellation of Ship's Keel \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_(constellation)\">Carina</a>).",
