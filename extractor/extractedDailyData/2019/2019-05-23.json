  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn May 20, a nearly Full Moon and Jupiter shared this telephoto field of\nview.\n\nCaptured when a passing cloud bank dimmed the moonlight,\nthe single exposure reveals the familiar\nface of our fair planet's own large natural satellite, along\nwith bright Jupiter (lower right) and some of its\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/\nin-depth/#the_galilean_moons_otp\">Galilean moons</a>.\n\nLined up left to right the tiny pinpricks of light near Jupiter are\n<a href=\"ap090920.html\">Ganymede</a>,\n<a href=\"ap141127.html\">Europa</a>,\n[Jupiter] and\n<a href=\"ap020120.html\">Callisto</a>.\n\n(That's not just dust on your screen ...)\n\nCloser and brighter, our own natural satellite appears to loom large.\n\nBut Ganymede, and Callisto are physically larger than Earth's Moon,\nwhile <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/europa\">water\nworld Europa</a> is only slightly smaller. \n\nIn fact, of the Solar System's six\n<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/moons.htm\">largest\nplanetary satellites</a>, Saturn's moon Titan is missing\nfrom the scene and a fourth Galilean moon, Io, is hidden by our\nruling gas giant.",
