  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt isn't every night that a comet passes a galaxy.\n\nLast Thursday, though, binocular comet \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2018_Y1_(Iwamoto)\">C/2018 Y1 (Iwamoto)</a> moved nearly in front of a \nspiral galaxy of approximately the same brightness: \n<a href=\"ap150410.html\">NGC 2903</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/141385/comet-y1-iwamoto-tops-out-in-february/\">Comet Iwamoto</a> was discovered late last year and orbits \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> in a long \n<a href=\"https://www.intmath.com/plane-analytic-geometry/ellipse-interactive.php\">ellipse</a>.\n\nIt last visited the inner Solar System during the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages\">Middle Ages</a>, \naround the year 648.\n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/c-2018-y1-iwamoto-jan-feb-2019\">The comet</a> reached its closest point to the Sun -- between Earth and Mars -- on February 6, and its closest point to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/\">Earth</a> \na few days ago, on February 13.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/norbert.span.1/posts/999275483604179\">featured time-lapse video</a> condenses almost \nthree hours into about ten seconds, and was captured last week from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland\">Switzerland</a>.\n\nAt that time \n<a href=\"ap190209.html\">Comet Iwamoto</a>, sporting a \n<a href=\"ap160605.html\">green coma</a>, was about 10 light minutes distant, \nwhile spiral galaxy \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2903\">NGC 2903</a> \nremained about 30 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> away. \n\nTwo satellites zip diagonally through the field about a third of the way through the video. \n\nTypically, \n<a href=\"ap170923.html\">a few comets</a> each year become as bright as \n<a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/comet-iwamoto-ascends-and-brightens/\">Comet Iwamoto</a>.",
