  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTwenty-one years ago\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...193.3904A/abstract\">results</a> were\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....116.1009R/abstract\">first presented</a> indicating that most of the energy in our\nuniverse is not in stars or galaxies but is tied to space itself.  \n\nIn the language of cosmologists, a large\n<a href=\"https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_accel.html\">cosmological constant</a> -- dark energy -- was directly implied by new distant\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/\">supernova</a> observations.  \n\nSuggestions of a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant\">cosmological constant</a> were\n<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2001-1\">not new</a> -- they have existed since the advent of\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm\">modern relativistic cosmology</a>.\n\nSuch claims were not usually popular with astronomers,\nthough, because dark energy was so unlike known\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N/abstract\">universe components</a>, because\ndark energy's abundance  appeared limited by other observations,\nand because less-<a href=\"ap071021.html\">strange cosmologies</a> \nwithout a significant amount of dark energy \nhad previously done well in explaining the data.\n\nWhat was exceptional here was the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations and the good reputations of the\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/oir/Research/supernova/highz/members.html\">scientists conducting</a>\n<a href=\"http://panisse.lbl.gov/public/\">the investigations</a>.\n\nOver the <a href=\"ap980302.html\">two decades</a>, independent\nteams of astronomers have continued to accumulate data\nthat appears to <a href=\"ap050925.html\">confirm</a> the existence of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a> and\nthe unsettling result of a presently\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe\">accelerating universe</a>.\n\nIn 2011, the team leaders were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/science/space/05nobel.html\">awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for their work.  \n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova//highz/figures/pictures.html\">featured</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo9919i/\">picture</a> of a supernova that occurred in\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AGAb...14R.146D/abstract\">1994</a>\non the outskirts of a\n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a>\nwas taken by one of these collaborations.",
