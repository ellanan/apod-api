  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere else might life exist?  \n\nOne of humanity's great outstanding questions, locating planets where extrasolar life might survive took a step forward recently with the discovery of a significant amount of water vapor in the atmosphere of distant exoplanet \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2-18b\">K2-18b</a>.\n\nThe planet and it parent star, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2-18\">K2-18</a>, \nlie about 124 light years away toward the constellation of the \n<a href=\"http://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1wvWmKxSYBuNjSspjq6x73VXay.jpg_q50.jpg\">Lion</a> \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)\">Leo</a>).\n\nThe \n<a href=\"ap190710.html\">exoplanet</a> is significantly larger and more massive than our Earth, but orbits in the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/habitable-zones-of-different-stars\">habitable zone</a> of its home star.\n\nK2-18, although more red than our Sun, shines in \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1916a/\">K2-18b</a>'s \nsky with a brightness similar to the \n<a href=\"ap150512.html\">Sun in Earth's sky</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2019/09/11/water-detected-on-an-exoplanet-located-in-its-star-s-habitable-zone/\">discovery</a> \nwas made in data from three space telescopes: \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/the-telescope\">Hubble</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/info/277-Fast-Facts\">Spitzer</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index.html\">Kepler</a>, by noting the absorption of water-vapor colors when the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/transit-photometry.html\">planet moved in front</a> of the star.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1916a/\">featured illustration</a> imagines exoplanet K2-18b on the right, its parent \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf\">red dwarf star</a> \nK2-18 on the left, and an unconfirmed sister planet between them.",
