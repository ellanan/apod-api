  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Pelican Nebula is slowly being transformed.  \n\nIC 5070, the official designation, is divided from the larger \n<a href=\"ap000501.html\">North America Nebula</a> by a \n<a href=\"ap141214.html\">molecular cloud</a> filled with dark \n<a href=\"http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/interstellardust.cfm\">dust</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1jUJQyzv8M\">Pelican</a>, \nhowever, receives much study because it is a particularly active mix of \n<a href=\"ap120722.html\">star formation</a> and evolving gas clouds.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/421162/B/\">featured picture</a> \nwas produced in three specific colors -- light emitted by \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/16.shtml\">sulfur</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\">hydrogen</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://www.chemicool.com/elements/oxygen.html\">oxygen</a> --  \nthat can help us to better understand these interactions.  \n\nThe light from young energetic stars is slowly transforming the cold gas to hot gas, \nwith the <a href=\"ap180205.html\">advancing boundary</a> \nbetween the two, known as an \n<a href=\"ap031013.html\">ionization front</a>, visible in bright orange on the right.\n\nParticularly dense \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle#/media/File:Snail-front-0A.jpg\">tentacles</a> of cold gas remain.  \n\nMillions of years from now this nebula might no longer \nbe known as the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=Pelican\">Pelican</a>, \nas the <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJ...239..121B/abstract\">balance and placement of stars and gas</a> \nwill surely leave something that appears completely different.",
