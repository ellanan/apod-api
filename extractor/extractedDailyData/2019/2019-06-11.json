  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening in and around the Cave Nebula?\n\nTo help find out, NASA's orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/mission/32-Mission-Overview\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> looked into this \n<a href=\"ap181114.html\">optically-dark star-forming region</a> \nin four colors of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared light</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap170323.html\">Cave Nebula</a>, cataloged as Sh2-155, is quite bright in infrared, \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7413\">revealing details</a> not only of internal pillars of gas and dust, but of the illuminating star cluster too - \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/p7YQ-KvGbJQ\">all near</a> the top of the image. \n\nThe red glow around the \n<a href=\"ap150707.html\">Cave's entrance</a> \nis created by dust heated by bright young stars.\n\nTo the right is \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/multimedia/photo09-062.html\">Cepheus B</a>, a star cluster that formed previously \nfrom the same cloud of gas and dust.\n\nOther <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..238...20B/abstract\">interesting stars</a> of Cepheus come to light in infrared as well, including those illuminating an even younger nebula toward the image bottom, and a \n<a href=\"ap170408.html\">runaway star</a> pushing a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shocks_in_astrophysics\">bow shock</a>, tinged in red near the image center.\n\nThis region spans about 50 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> \nand lies about 2,500 light years toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation)\">Cepheus</a>).",
