  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen a dragon in the sky?\n\nAlthough real flying \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon\">dragons</a> \ndon't exist, a huge dragon-shaped aurora developed in the sky over Iceland \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=06&amp;month=02&amp;year=2019\">earlier this month</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-auroras\">aurora</a> was caused by a \n<a href=\"ap100828.html\">hole</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap170920.html\">Sun's corona</a> that expelled charged particles into a \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">solar wind</a> \nthat followed a changing \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/imf.html\">interplanetary magnetic field</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/470195main_magnetosphere_full.jpg\">Earth's magnetosphere</a>. \n\nAs some of those particles then struck \n<a href=\"https://espo.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/Atmosphere36small.jpg\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, they \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/atom.html\">excited atoms</a> which subsequently emitted light: aurora.\n\nThis iconic display was so \n<a href=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2505/4139267083_915e393dbb.jpg\">enthralling</a> that the photographer's mother \nran out to see it and was captured in the foreground. \n\nNo <a href=\"ap150629.html\">sunspots</a> have appeared \n<a href=\"https://www.aurorahunter.com/solar-cycle.html\">on the Sun</a> so far in February, making the multiple days of \n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/aurora_gallery.html\">picturesque auroral activity</a> this month somewhat surprising.",
