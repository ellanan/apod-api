  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNow this was a view with a thrill.\n\nFrom \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gm8sOBqSyQw\">Mount Tschirgant</a> \nin the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a>, \nyou can see not only nearby towns and distant \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrol\">Tyrol</a>ean peaks, \nbut also, weather permitting, stars, nebulas, and the band of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nWhat made the arduous climb worthwhile this night, \nthough, was another peak -- the peak of the 2018 \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseids</a> \n<a href=\"ap180908.html\">Meteor</a> \n<a href=\"ap170801.html\">Shower</a>.\n\nAs hoped, dispersing clouds allowed a picturesque sky-gazing session that included many faint meteors, all while a carefully positioned camera took a series of exposures.\n\nSuddenly, a thrilling meteor -- \n<a href=\"ap171225.html\">bright</a> and \n<a href=\"ap181219.html\">colorful</a> -- slashed down right next the nearly \n<a href=\"ap180911.html\">vertical band of the Milky Way</a>. \n\nAs luck would have it, the camera caught it too. \n\nTherefore, a new image in the series was quickly taken with one of the \n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky-gazers</a> posing on the nearby peak.\n\nLater, all of the images were <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DrNicholasRoemmeltPhotography/photos/a.230469333765914/1468508936628608/?type=3&amp;theater\">digitally combined</a>.",
