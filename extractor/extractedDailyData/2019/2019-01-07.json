  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was an unusual night to look in the direction of the Bull.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)\">constellation Taurus</a> is always well known \nfor hosting two bright star clusters -- \n<a href=\"ap150617.html\">the Pleaides</a>, visible on the right, \nand the comparatively diffuse \n<a href=\"ap121224.html\">Hyades</a>, visible on the left. \n\nThis night last month, however, was atypically the peak of the \n<a href=\"ap171222.html\">Geminid meteor shower</a>, and so several meteors were caught shooting through the constellation with \n<a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-angle/angles-between-lines/e/parallel_lines_1\">parallel trails</a>.\n\nMore unusually still, \n<a href=\"http://www.cometwatch.co.uk/comet-46p-wirtanen/\">Comet Wirtanen</a> was drifting through the constellation, \nhere appearing near the image bottom surrounded by a greenish coma.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/in-depth/\">comet</a> was near its brightest as it \n<a href=\"ap181216.html\">sped past</a> the Earth.\n\nThe orange star on the upper left is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldebaran\">Aldebaran</a>, considered to be the eye of the Bull.\n\nAldebaran is the brightest star in Taurus and the 15th \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars\">brightest star</a> in the sky. \n\nThe featured image is a combination of nearly 800 exposures taken from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spanish</a> village \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zIIR23JzfXE\">Albany�</a>.",
