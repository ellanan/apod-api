  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan you find supernova 1987A? \n\nIt isn't hard -- it occurred at the center of the expanding \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullseye_(target)\">bullseye pattern</a>. \n\nAlthough this stellar detonation was first seen in 1987, light from \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/sn1987anino.html\">SN 1987A</a> continued to bounce off clumps of \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">interstellar dust</a> \nand be reflected to us even many years later. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/2662-ssc2005-14d-Illustration-of-a-Light-Echo\">Light echoes</a> recorded between 1988 and 1992 by the \n<a href=\"https://www.aao.gov.au/about-us/anglo-australian-telescope\">Anglo Australian Telescope</a> (AAT) in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> \nare shown moving out from the position of the \nsupernova in the featured time-lapse sequence. \n\nThese images were composed by subtracting an LMC image taken before the \n<a href=\"https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a> \nlight arrived from later LMC images that included the supernova echo.\n\nOther prominent \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_echo\">light echo</a> \nsequences include those taken by the \n<a href=\"http://eros.in2p3.fr/EchoesSN1987a/\">EROS2</a> and \n<a href=\"ap060125.html\">SuperMACHO</a> sky monitoring projects. \n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510738\">Studies</a> of \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02643\">expanding light echo</a> \nrings around other supernovas \nhave enabled more accurate determinations of the location, date, and \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...767...45S\">symmetry</a> of these tremendous stellar explosions.\n\nYesterday marked the 32nd anniversary of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A\">SN 1987A</a>: \nthe last recorded supernova in or around our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, \nand the last to be visible to the unaided eye.",
