  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe galaxy was never in danger.\n\nFor one thing, the \n<a href=\"ap180927.html\">Triangulum galaxy</a> (M33), pictured, \nis much bigger than the \n<a href=\"ap011117.html\">tiny grain of rock</a> \nat the head of the meteor.\n\nFor another, the galaxy is much farther away -- in this instance 3 million \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light year</a>s as opposed to only about 0.0003 light seconds. \n\nEven so, the \n<a href=\"ap130209.html\">meteor's path</a> \ntook it angularly below the galaxy.\n\nAlso the wind high in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/662995main_upper-atmosphere-MOS_full.jpg\">Earth's atmosphere</a> blew the \n<a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/catching-meteor-train\">meteor's glowing evaporative molecule train</a> away from the galaxy, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective#/media/File:Europe_2007_Disk_1_340.jpg\">angular projection</a>. \n\nStill, the astrophotographer was quite lucky to capture \n<a href=\"ap180812.html\">both a meteor and a galaxy</a> in a single exposure -- which was subsequently added to two other images of M33 to bring up the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral galaxy</a>'s colors. \n\nAt the end, \n<a href=\"https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-faq/\">the meteor</a> was gone in a second, but \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Galaxy\">the galaxy</a> will last billions of years.",
