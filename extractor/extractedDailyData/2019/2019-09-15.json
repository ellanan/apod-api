  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was one of the largest and longest lived storms ever recorded in our Solar System.  \n\nFirst seen in late 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.ciclops.org/index/6967/The_Saturn_Storm_Chronicles\">above cloud formation</a> in the northern hemisphere of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> started larger than the Earth and\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7O8Hsuxjyo\">soon spread</a> completely around the planet.\n\nThe storm was tracked not only\n<a href=\"ap110317.html\">from Earth</a> but from\n<a href=\"ap110119.html\">up close</a> by the robotic\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> then orbiting Saturn.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12829\">Pictured here</a> in false colored infrared in February, \norange colors indicate\n<a href=\"ap110708.html\">clouds deep</a> in the atmosphere, \nwhile light colors highlight clouds higher up.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">rings of Saturn</a> are seen nearly edge-on as the thin blue horizontal line.\n\nThe warped dark bands are the\n<a href=\"ap111012.html\">shadows of the rings</a> \ncast onto the cloud tops by the Sun to the upper left.\n\nA source of radio noise from\n<a href=\"ap100419.html\">lightning</a>, the\n<a href=\"ap080505.html\">intense storm</a> was thought to relate to seasonal changes when spring\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW0EsR2FBD4\">emerges</a> in the north of  \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvTSB5B0d0w\">Saturn</a>.\n\nAfter raging for over six months, the \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Icar..223..460S/abstract\">iconic storm</a> circled the entire planet and then tried to absorb its own tail -- which surprisingly caused it to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20130131.html\">fade away</a>.",
