  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA star cluster around 2 million years young surrounded by\nnatal clouds of dust and glowing gas,\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m016.html\">M16 is also</a>\nknown as The Eagle Nebula.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.martinpughastrophotography.space/m16\">This\nbeautifully detailed portrait</a>\nof the region was made with groundbased narrow and broadband image data.\n\nIt includes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Nebula\">cosmic\nsculptures</a> made famous in\nHubble Space Telescope close-ups of the starforming complex.\n\nDescribed as elephant trunks or\n<a href=\"ap150107.html\">Pillars of Creation</a>, dense,\ndusty columns rising near the center are light-years in length but\nare gravitationally contracting\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/StarForm.html\">to\nform stars</a>.\n\nEnergetic radiation from the cluster stars erodes material near\nthe tips, eventually exposing the embedded new stars.\n\nExtending from the ridge of bright emission at lower left\nis another dusty starforming column known as the\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2005/12b/index.html\">Fairy\nof Eagle Nebula</a>.\n\nM16 lies about 7,000 light-years away,\nan easy target for binoculars or small telescopes in a\n<a href=\"ap130712.html\">nebula rich</a> part of the sky\ntoward the split constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens\">Serpens Cauda</a>\n(the tail of the snake).",
