  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to orbit a black hole?\n\nMany <a href=\"ap190411.html\">black holes</a> \nare surrounded by swirling pools of gas known as \n<a href=\"ap170327.html\">accretion disks</a>.\n\nThese disks can be extremely hot, and much of the orbiting gas will eventually fall through the black hole's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon\">event horizon</a> -- where it will never be seen again.\n\nThe featured animation is an \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1913/\">artist's rendering</a> of the curious disk spiraling around the \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Supermassive+Black+Hole\">supermassive black hole</a> at the center of \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/25527651898/\">spiral galaxy NGC 3147</a>. \n\nGas at the inner edge of this disk is \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">so close</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes\">black hole</a> that it moves unusually fast -- at 10 percent of the \n<a href=\"http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/spedlite.html\">speed of light</a>.\n\nGas this fast shows \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_beaming\">relativistic beaming</a>, making the side of the disk heading toward us appear \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/71/20/217120f7a5552f77aa03095b69e5d98b.jpg\">significantly brighter</a> than the side moving away.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1913a/\">animation</a> is based on images of NGC 3147 made recently with the \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/about/general/fact_sheet/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.",
