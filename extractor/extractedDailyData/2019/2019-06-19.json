  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's the magnetic field like in the center of our Milky Way Galaxy?\n\nTo help find out, NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.sofia.usra.edu/multimedia/about-sofia\">SOFIA</a> -- an observatory  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sofiaoversierra.jpg\">flying in a modified 747</a> -- imaged the central region with an instrument known as HAWC+. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/ames/image-feature/one-of-a-kind-camera-added-to-sofia\">HAWC+</a> maps magnetism by observing \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)\">polarized</a> \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> \nlight emitted by elongated dust grains rotating in alignment with the local \n<a href=\"https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html\">magnetic field</a>. \n\nNow at our \n<a href=\"ap180729.html\">Milky Way's center</a> is a \n<a href=\"ap190411.html\">supermassive black hole</a> \nwith a hobby of absorbing gas from \n<a href=\"ap151028.html\">stars it has recently destroyed</a>. \n\nOur galaxy's black hole, though, \nis relatively quiet compared to the absorption rate of the central black holes in \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/active_galaxies1.html\">active galaxies</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/magnetic-field-may-be-keeping-milky-way-s-black-hole-quiet\">featured image</a> gives a clue as to why -- a surrounding magnetic field may either channel gas into the black hole -- which lights up its exterior, or forces gas into an \n<a href=\"ap131120.html\">accretion-disk</a> holding pattern, causing it to be \n<a href=\"https://d20yzjdgduq6fa.cloudfront.net/images/stories/cleanlaugh/cats/cattiredeat.jpg\">less active</a> -- at least temporarily.\n\nInspection of the featured image -- appearing perhaps like a surreal mashup of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impasto\">impasto art</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbmf0bB38h0\">gravitational astrophysics</a> -- \nbrings out this telling clue by detailing the \nmagnetic field in and around a dusty ring surrounding \n<a href=\"ap130906.html\">Sagittarius A*</a>, the black hole in our \n<a href=\"ap180122.html\">Milky Way's center</a>.",
