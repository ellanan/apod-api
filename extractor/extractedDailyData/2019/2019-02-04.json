  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMassive stars profoundly affect their galactic environments. \n\nChurning and mixing interstellar clouds of gas and dust, \nstars -- most notably those upwards of tens of times the mass of our Sun -- \nleave their mark on the \n<a href=\"ap171024.html\">compositions</a> and \n<a href=\"ap170417.html\">locations</a> of future \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/stellar_evol_feat_912.html\">generations of stars</a>. \n\nDramatic evidence of this is illustrated in our neighboring galaxy, the \n<a href=\"ap180428.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> (LMC), by the \n<a href=\"https://astrodrudis.com/n70-henize-70/\">featured nebula, Henize 70</a> (also known as N70 and DEM301). \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AJ....148..102R\">Henize 70</a> is actually a luminous superbubble of interstellar gas about 300 light-years in diameter, blown by \n<a href=\"ap140701.html\">winds</a> from hot, massive stars and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aysiMbgml5g\">supernova explosions</a>, \nwith its interior filled with tenuous hot and expanding gas. \n\nBecause \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbubble\">superbubble</a>s can expand through an entire galaxy, they offer \n<a href=\"ap160815.html\">humanity</a> \na chance to explore the connection between the lifecycles of stars and the \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/evolution+of+galaxies\">evolution of galaxies</a>.",
