  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nRidges of glowing interstellar gas and\ndark dust clouds inhabit the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/38/\nimage/b/\">turbulent, cosmic depths</a> of the Lagoon Nebula.\n\nAlso known as M8, the bright star forming region is about\n5,000 light-years distant.\n\nBut it still makes for a popular stop on\n<a href=\"ap141125.html\">telescopic tours</a> of\nthe constellation Sagittarius, toward the center\nof our Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nDominated by the telltale red emission of ionized hydrogen atoms\nrecombining with stripped electrons,\nthis stunning view of the Lagoon is over 100 light-years across. \n\nAt its center, the bright, compact, hourglass\nshape is gas ionized and sculpted by energetic radiation\nand extreme stellar winds from a\n<a href=\"ap140820.html\">massive young star</a>.\n\nIn fact, the many bright stars of open cluster NGC 6530 drift\nwithin the nebula,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0898\">just formed</a> in\nthe Lagoon several million years ago.\n\nBroadband image data from <a href=\"ap190405.html\">Pan-STARRS</a>\n(Panoramic Survey Telescope &amp; Rapid Response System)\nwas combined with narrowband data from amateur telescopes to create this\nwide and deep portrait of the Lagoon Nebula.",
