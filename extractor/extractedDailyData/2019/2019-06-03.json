  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhen did these big galaxies first begin to dance? \n\nReally only four of the five of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan%27s_Quintet\">Stephan's Quintet</a> are locked in a cosmic tango of \nrepeated close encounters taking place some 300 million \n<a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light-years</a> away. \n\nThe odd galaxy out is easy to spot in \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/407371/B/?nc=user\">this recently \nreprocessed image</a> by the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> -- the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....122.2993S\">interacting galaxies</a>, NGC 7319, 7318B, 7318A, and 7317 (left to right), \nhave a more dominant yellowish cast. \n\nThey also tend to have distorted \n<a href=\"ap130416.html\">loops</a> and \n<a href=\"ap181211.html\">tails</a>, \ngrown under the influence of \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">disruptive gravitational tides</a>. \n\nThe mostly bluish galaxy, large NGC 7320 on the lower left, is in the foreground at about 40 million light-years distant, and so is not part of the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgIgKcqPd4k\">interacting group</a>.\n\nData and modeling indicate that NGC 7318B is a relatively new intruder.\n\nA <a href=\"http://cfht.hawaii.edu/en/news/StephansQuintetLSB/\">recently-discovered halo</a> of old red stars surrounding \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-018-0415-2\">Stephan's Quintet</a> indicate that at least some of these \ngalaxies started tangling over a billion years.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/image/3848/printshop\">Stephan's Quintet</a> is visible with a moderate sized-telescope toward the constellation of Winged Horse \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(constellation)\">Pegasus</a>).",
