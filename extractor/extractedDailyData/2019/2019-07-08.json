  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening at the center of our galaxy?\n\nIt's hard to tell with optical telescopes since \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible light</a> is blocked by intervening interstellar dust.\n\nIn other bands of light, though, such as \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap180729.html\">galactic center</a> \ncan be imaged and shows itself to be quite an \n<a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/stunning-chaos-in-the-galactic-core\">interesting and active place</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ska.ac.za/media-releases/meerkat-radio-telescope-inaugurated-in-south-africa-reveals-clearest-view-yet-of-center-of-the-milky-way/\">featured picture</a> shows the inaugural image of the \n<a href=\"https://www.ska.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/\">MeerKAT array</a> \nof 64 radio dishes just completed in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa\">South Africa</a>.\n\nSpanning four times the angular size of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> \n(2 <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/degrees.html\">degrees</a>), \nthe image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed. \n\n<a href=\"ap020803.html\">Many known sources</a> \nare shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the Galactic Center is in the direction of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)\">constellation Sagittarius</a>. \n\nIn our Galaxy's Center lies \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A\">Sgr A</a>, \nfound here just to the right of the image center, which houses the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. \n\nOther sources in the image are not as well understood, including \n<a href=\"ap020521.html\">the Arc</a>, just to the left of \n\n<a href=\"ap180122.html\">Sgr A</a>, and numerous filamentary threads.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ska.ac.za/science-engineering/meerkat/observers/observing-programme/large-survey-projects/\">Goals for MeerKAT</a> include searching for radio emission \nfrom neutral hydrogen emitted in a much younger universe and brief but distant \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/F/Fast+Radio+Bursts\">radio flashes</a>.",
