  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTo some, this nebula looks like the head of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish#/media/File:Lampanyctodes_hectoris_(Hector's_lanternfish)2.png\">fish</a>.\n\nHowever, <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/407970/\">this colorful cosmic portrait</a> really features\n<a href=\"http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">glowing gas\nand obscuring dust</a> clouds in IC 1795,\na star forming region in the northern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)\">constellation Cassiopeia</a>.\n\nThe nebula's colors were created by adopting the\n<a href=\"http://bf-astro.com/hubblep.htm\">Hubble color palette</a>\nfor mapping narrow emission from oxygen, hydrogen,\nand sulfur atoms to blue, green and red colors, and further\nblending the data with images of the region recorded through\nbroadband filters.\n\nNot far on the sky from the famous <a href=\"ap091204.html\">Double Star\nCluster</a> in Perseus, IC 1795 is itself located next to IC 1805,\nthe <a href=\"ap090214.html\">Heart Nebula</a>, as part of a\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/nebulae/ic1805.html\">complex\nof star forming regions</a> that lie\nat the edge of a large molecular cloud.\n\nLocated just over 6,000 \n<a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light-years</a> away, the larger\nstar forming complex sprawls along the Perseus spiral arm of\nour <a href=\"ap080606.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nAt that distance, this picture would span about 70 light-years\nacross IC 1795.",
