  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGrand tidal streams of stars seem to surround galaxy\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\nsmall_ring_ngc5907.html\">NGC 5907</a>.\n\nThe arcing structures form tenuous loops extending more than 150,000\nlight-years from the narrow, edge-on spiral, also known as the\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n5907.html\">Splinter</a>\nor Knife Edge Galaxy.\n\nRecorded only in very deep exposures, the streams likely represent\nthe ghostly trail of a\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2016/hubble-views-a-stubborn-dwarf-galaxy\">dwarf galaxy</a> - debris left along the\norbit of a smaller satellite galaxy that was\n<a href=\"https://www.cosmotography.com/images/ngc5907_animation.html\">gradually\ntorn apart</a> and merged with NGC 5907 over four billion years ago.\n\nUltimately this remarkable discovery image, from a small robotic\nobservatory in New Mexico, supports the cosmological\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1137\">scenario</a> in\nwhich large spiral galaxies,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703601\">including</a>\nour own Milky Way, were\nformed by the accretion of smaller ones.\n\nNGC 5907 lies about 40 million light-years distant in the northern\nconstellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dra/index.html\">Draco</a>.",
