  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGorgeous spiral galaxy M33 seems to have more than its fair share of\nglowing hydrogen gas.\n\nA prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also\nknown as the <a href=\"ap160917.html\">Triangulum Galaxy</a> and\nlies a mere 3 million light-years away. \n\nThe galaxy's inner 30,000 light-years or so are shown in this\n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M33-Subaru-Gendler.html\">\nmagnificent 25 panel telescopic mosaic</a>.\n\nBased on image data from space and ground-based telescopes,\nthe portrait of M33 shows off the galaxy's reddish ionized hydrogen\nclouds or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region\">HII\nregions</a>.\n\nSprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/30/\">M33's\ngiant HII regions</a> are some of the largest known\nstellar nurseries, sites of the formation of short-lived\nbut very massive stars.\n\nIntense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes\nthe surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the\ncharacteristic red glow.\n\nTo enhance this image, broadband data were used to produce a color view\nof the galaxy and combined with narrowband data recorded through a\nhydrogen-alpha filter.\n\nThat filter transmits the light of the strongest visible hydrogen\n<a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/nasa/\nmeasuringuniverse/spectroscopy/a/absorptionemission-lines\">emission\nline</a>.",
