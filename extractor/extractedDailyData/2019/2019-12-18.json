  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat do neutron stars look like?\n\nPreviously these \n<a href=\"https://media.ligo.northwestern.edu/gallery/neutron-star-over-chicago\">city-sized stars</a> were too small and too far away to resolve.\n\nRecently, however, the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-nicer-delivers-best-ever-pulsar-measurements-1st-surface-map\">first maps</a> of the locations and sizes of \n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-04-magnetic-hot-neutron-stars-survive.html\">hotspots</a> on a neutron star's surface have been \nmade by carefully modeling how the rapid spin makes the star's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">X-ray</a> \nbrightness rise and fall. \n\nBased on a leading model, an \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13240\">illustrative map</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar\">pulsar</a> \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4377\">J0030+0451</a>'s hotspots is pictured, \nwith the rest of the star's surface filled in with a false patchy blue. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/12/16/nasas-nicer-mission-reveals-an-unexpected-neutron-star-surprise/\">J0030</a> \nspins once every 0.0049 seconds and is located about 1000 \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> away.\n\n<a href=\"https://cms.iopscience.org/c5dfe599-1b5b-11ea-8ae4-b3312b4ab81c/J0030_Model_Side-by-Side_.gif\">The map</a> was computed from data taken by NASA's Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR \n(<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-nicer\">NICER</a>) \nX-ray telescope attached to the \n<a href=\"ap151109.html\">International Space Station</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887L..24M/abstract\">computed locations</a> of \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887L..21R/abstract\">these hotspots</a> is surprising and not well understood.\n\nBecause the gravitational \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...300..203F/abstract\">lensing effect of neutron stars</a> is so strong, J0300 \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">displays more than half</a> \nof its surface toward the Earth. \n\n<a href=\"https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/cat_staring_at_fish_in_jar_596232.jpg\">Studying</a> the \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887L..26B/abstract\">appearance of pulsars like J0030</a> \nallows accurate estimates of the \n<a href=\"ap180930.html\">neutron star</a>'s mass, radius, and the \n<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_NICER_Constraints_on_the_Dense_Matter_Equation_of_State\">internal physics</a> that keeps the star from imploding into a \n<a href=\"http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/BHfaq.html\">black hole</a>.",
