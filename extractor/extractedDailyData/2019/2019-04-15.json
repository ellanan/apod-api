  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDo you see the dolphin-shaped cloud on Jupiter?\n\nThe cloud was visible last year during \n<a href=\"ap190205.html\">perijove 16</a>, the sixteenth time that NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html\">spacecraft Juno</a> passed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016. \n\nDuring each perijove, \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/\">Juno</a> \npasses near a slightly different part of Jupiter's cloud tops. \n\nThe dolphin shape may be surprising but is not scientifically significant -- clouds on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> \nare constantly shifting and can temporarily \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcrEqIpi6sg\">mimic many familiar shapes</a>.\n\nThe cloud appears in Jupiter's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#/media/File:Jupiter_cloud_bands.svg\">South Temperate Belt</a> (STB), \na band of dark and dropping clouds that rings the \nplanet and also contains \n<a href=\"ap151024.html\">Oval BA</a>, dubbed \n<a href=\"ap060505.html\">Red Spot Jr.</a> \n\nThe <a href=\"http://junocam.pictures/gerald/uploads/20181108/\">featured image</a> was digitally processed to enhance color and contrast. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">Juno's next swoop</a> near Jupiter -- perijove 20 -- will occur on late May.",
