  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nUltima Thule is not the object humanity thought that it was last month. \n\nWhen the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> zoomed past the distant asteroid \nUltima Thule (officially \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69\">2014 MU69</a>) \nin early January, \n<a href=\"ap190103.html\">early images</a> showed \n<a href=\"ap190129.html\">two circular lobes</a> \nthat when most simply extrapolated to 3D were thought to be, roughly, spheres.\n\nHowever, analyses of newly beamed-back images -- including \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20190208\">many taken soon after closest approach</a> -- \nshows eclipsed stars re-appearing \n<a href=\"https://i.imgflip.com/eyvnj.jpg\">sooner than expected</a>.\n\nThe only explanation possible is that this 30-km long \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt\">Kuiper belt object</a> \nhas a different 3D shape than believed only a few weeks ago. \n\nSpecifically, as shown in the \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Galleries/Featured-Images/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=590\">featured illustration</a>, it now appears that the larger lobe -- Ultima -- is more similar to a fluffy \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake\">pancake</a> than a sphere, while the smaller lobe -- Thule -- resembles a dented <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Juglans_regia_Echte_Walnussfrucht_2.jpg\">walnut</a>.\n\nThe remaining uncertainty in the outlines are shown by the dashed blue lines. \n\nThe new shape information indicates that gravity -- which \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/planets-round/en/\">contracts more massive bodies into spheres</a> -- \nplayed perhaps less of a role in contouring the lobes of \n<a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/we-ve-never-seen-something-like-this-orbiting-the-sun-ultima-thule-is-still-weird\">Ultima Thule</a> than previously thought.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft.php#Systems-and-Components\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> continued on to Ultima Thule after \n<a href=\"ap150831.html\">passing Pluto</a> in mid-2015.\n\n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20190115\">New data and images</a> are still being received.",
