  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created these huge galactic superbubbles?\n\nTwo of these \n<a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2019/ngc3079/\">unusual bubbles</a>, each spanning thousands of \n<a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light-years</a>, were recently discovered near the center of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3079\">spiral galaxy NGC 3079</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkgOh5jw3fg\">The superbubbles</a>, \nshown in purple on the image right, are so hot they emit X-rays detected by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov\">NASA</a>'s Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/\">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a>. \n\nSince the bubbles straddle the center of NGC 3079, a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190110536L\">leading hypothesis</a> is that they were \nsomehow created by the interaction of the central \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/s/supermassive+black+hole\">supermassive black hole</a> with surrounding gas. \n\nAlternatively, the \n<a href=\"ap170625.html\">superbubbles</a> might have been created primarily by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\">energetic winds</a> \nfrom many young and hot stars near that galaxy's center.\n\nThe only similar known phenomenon is the \n<a href=\"ap101110.html\">gamma-ray emitting Fermi bubbles</a> \nemanating from the center of our Milky Way Galaxy, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXmPxSP225Y\">discovered 10 years ago</a> in images taken by NASA's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope\">Fermi satellite</a>.\n\nResearch into the nature of the \n<a href=\"ap041016.html\">NGC 3079</a> \nsuperbubbles will surely continue, \nas well as searches for high-energy superbubbles in other galaxies.",
