  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe history of the Moon is partly written in its craters. \n\nPictured here is a lunar panorama taken from Earth featuring the large craters \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langrenus_(crater)\">Langrenus</a>, toward the left, and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petavius_(crater)\">Petavius</a>, toward the right.\n\nThe craters formed in separate \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">impacts</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/453\">Langrenus</a> spans about 130 km, has a terraced rim, and sports a central peak rising about 3 km. \n\n<a href=\"http://lunarnetworks.blogspot.com/2012/12/lroc-petavius.html\">Petavius</a> is slightly larger with a 180 km diameter and has a distinctive fracture that runs out from its center.\n\nAlthough it is known that Petravius crater is about 3.9 \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_geologic_timescale\">billion years old</a>, the origin of its large \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/371/fractured-crater/\">fracture</a> \nis unknown. \n\nThe craters are best visible a few days after a \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/dr-marc-moon-phases/en/\">new Moon</a>, when \n<a href=\"https://www.themadcatlady.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SAM_1629.jpg\">shadows most greatly accentuate</a> vertical walls and hills. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/astrofotografiarafaela/photos/a.407916176064535/1072090396313773/?type=3&amp;theater\">featured image</a> is a composite of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_imaging\">best of</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=488OSfvqIcM\">thousands of</a> \nhigh-resolution, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a>, \nvideo images taken through a small telescope. \n\nAlthough mountains on \n<a href=\"https://epod.usra.edu/\">Earth</a> \nwill likely erode into soil over a billion years, \n<a href=\"https://www2.lpod.org/wiki/Main_Page\">lunar</a> craters Langrenus and Petavius will likely survive many billions more years, possibly until the Sun expands and \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-sun-will-eventually-engulf-earth-maybe/\">engulfs</a> both the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">Moon</a>.",
