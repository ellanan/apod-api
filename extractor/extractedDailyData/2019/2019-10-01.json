  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you were a small one-eyed monster, would you want to visit a black hole?\n\nWell the one in \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13322\">this video</a> does -- but should it?\n\nNo, actually, but since our little friend is insistent on going, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aMTwtb3TVIk\">the video</a> \ninforms it what black holes really are, and how to be as safe as possible when visiting.\n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes\">Black holes</a> are clumps of matter so dense that light cannot escape.\n\n<a href=\"ap190414.html\">Pairs of black holes</a>, \neach several times the mass of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>, have recently been \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observations\">found to merge</a> by detection of unusual \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw\">gravitational radiation</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"ap190820.html\">regions surrounding</a> \n<a href=\"ap181203.html\">supermassive black holes</a> \nin the centers of galaxies can light up as stars that near them get \n<a href=\"ap151028.html\">shredded</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_black_holes\">closest known black hole</a> to the Earth is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A0620-00\">V616 Mon</a>, \nwhich is about 3,300 light years away.\n\nThe best way for our monster friend to \n<a href=\"http://s8.favim.com/orig/72/animals-cat-cats-hiding-Favim.com-673698.jpg\">stay safe</a>, the video informs, is to not go too close.",
