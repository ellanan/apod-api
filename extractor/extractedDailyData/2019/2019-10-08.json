  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis phenomenon occurs in the sky over our heads, not the sea. \n\nIt is a type of lightning known as red sprite, and \nrarely has it ever been photographed in this detail. \n\nEven though sprites have been recorded for over 30 years, \ntheir root cause remains unknown. \n\nSome <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/30oct_lightning.html\">thunderstorms</a> have them, but most don't.\n\nThese mysterious bursts of light in the upper atmosphere momentarily resemble \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish#mediaviewer/File:Largelionsmanejellyfish.jpg\">gigantic jellyfish</a>.\n\nA few years ago \n<a href=\"ap141013.html\">high speed video</a>s \nwere taken detailing how red \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning)\">sprites</a> actually develop. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stephane.vetter.nuitsacrees/posts/2751990581478732\">featured image</a> was captured last month in high definition from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>. \n\nOne unusual feature of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/sprites.html\">sprites</a> is that they are relatively cold -- they operate more like long \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp\">fluorescent light tubes</a> than \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb\">hot compact light bulbs</a>. \n\nIn general, red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are \n<a href=\"ap190225.html\">best seen</a> when \n<a href=\"ap161205.html\">powerful thunderstorms</a> are visible from the side.",
