  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA payload on board the International Space Station, the\nNeutron star Interior Composition Explorer\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13031\">(NICER) twists and turns</a>\nto track cosmic sources\nof X-rays as the station orbits planet Earth every 93 minutes.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/\nnicer-s-night-moves-trace-the-x-ray-sky\">During orbit nighttime</a>,\nits X-ray detectors remain on.\n\nSo as NICER slews from target to target bright arcs and loops are\ntraced across this all-sky map made from 22 months of NICER data.\n\nThe arcs tend to converge on\n<a href=\"image/1906/NICERNightMoveslabels_0.jpg\">prominent bright\nspots</a>, pulsars in \nthe X-ray sky that NICER regularly targets and monitors.\n\nThe pulsars are spinning neutron stars that\nemit clock-like pulses of X-rays.\n\nTheir timing is so precise it can be\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/\nnasa-team-first-to-demonstrate-x-ray-navigation-in-space\">used for\nnavigation</a>, determining spacecraft speed and position.\n\nThis NICER X-ray, all-sky, map is composed in coordinates with the\n<a href=\"ap190321.html\">celestial equator</a>\nhorizontally across the center.",
