  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that dark spot on Jupiter?\n\nIt's the shadow of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a>'s most volcanic moon \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/io/overview/\">Io</a>.\n\nSince Jupiter shines predominantly by reflected sunlight, \nanything that blocks that light \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">leaves a shadow</a>. \n\nIf you could somehow be in that shadow, you would see a \n<a href=\"ap170820.html\">total eclipse of the Sun</a> by \n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/space/io/\">Io</a>. \n\n<a href=\"ap140330.html\">Io</a>'s shadow is about \n3600 kilometers across, roughly the same size as \n<a href=\"ap160904.html\">Io</a> itself -- and only slightly larger than \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">Earth's Moon</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/moon-shadow\">featured</a>  \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmgill/48745739051/\">image</a> was \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfh1a_K_6Yc\">taken</a> \nlast month by NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html\">Juno spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Jupiter.\n\nAbout every two months, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F5aoC66cpY\">Juno swoops</a> \nclose by Jupiter, takes a lot of data and snaps a series of images -- \nsome of which are \n<a href=\"ap190908.html\">made into</a> \n<a href=\"ap190205.html\">a video</a>.\n\nAmong <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES2zBbWqSl4\">many other things</a>, Juno has been measuring Jupiter's gravitational field, finding \n<a href=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad12683c000032000b0e42.jpeg\">surprising</a> evidence that Jupiter may be mostly a liquid.\n\nUnder unexpectedly thick clouds, the Jovian giant may house a massive \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen\">liquid hydrogen</a> \nregion that extends all the way to the center.",
