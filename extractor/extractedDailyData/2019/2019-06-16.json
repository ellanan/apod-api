  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created this unusual mountain?\n\nThere is a new theory. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahuna_Mons\">Ahuna Mons</a> \nis the largest mountain on the largest known asteroid in \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/solarsystem/needtoknow\">our Solar System</a>, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/ceres\">Ceres</a>, \nwhich orbits our Sun in the \n<a href=\"ap060319.html\">main asteroid belt</a> between \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars\">Mars</a> and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/indepth\">Jupiter</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap160319.html\">Ahuna Mons</a>, though, is \n<a href=\"http://data.whicdn.com/images/21613526/original.jpg\">like nothing</a> that humanity has ever seen before.\n\nFor one thing, its slopes are garnished not with \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_counting\">old craters</a> \nbut young vertical streaks. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/dlr/presse/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10172/213_read-35076/year-all/#/gallery/35500\">new hypothesis</a>, based on numerous gravity measurements, holds that a bubble of mud rose from deep within the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0378-7\">pushed through</a> \nthe icy surface at a weak point rich in \n<a href=\"ap151211.html\">reflective salt</a> -- and then froze. \n\nThe bright streaks are thought to be similar to \nother recently surfaced material such as visible in \n<a href=\"ap150514.html\">Ceres' famous bright spots</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20915\">featured double-height digital image</a> was constructed from \nsurface maps taken of Ceres in 2016 by the \n<a href=\"https://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/\">robotic Dawn mission</a>.\n\nSuccessfully completing its mission in 2018, \n<a href=\" https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-dawn-mission-to-asteroid-belt-comes-to-end\">Dawn continues to orbit Ceres</a> even though it has exhausted the fuel needed to keep its antennas pointed toward \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>.",
