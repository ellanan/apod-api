  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMeteor showers are caused by streams of solid particles, \ndust size and larger, moving as a group through space. \n\nIn most cases, the orbits of these \n<a href=\"ap180808.html\">meteor streams</a> can be identified with \n<a href=\"ap011117.html\">dust</a> expelled from a comet. \n\nWhen the Earth passes through a stream, \nthe particles leave brilliant trails through the night sky as they disintegrate in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/463940main_atmosphere-layers2_full.jpg\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nThe meteor paths are all \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/parallel.html\">parallel</a> to each other, but, \n<a href=\"http://en.es-static.us/upl/2010/12/railroad-tracks-converge-shutterstock-e1367591337388.jpg\">like train tracks</a>, \nthe effect of perspective causes them to appear to originate from a \n<a href=\"ap170427.html\">radiant point</a> in the distance. \n\nThe featured image composite was taken during January's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids\">Quadrantid meteor shower</a> from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub9622tvuUM\">La Palma</a>, \none of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a>, off the northwest coast of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap190109.html\">The Quadrantids</a> \nradiant is visible just below the handle of the \n<a href=\"ap171121.html\">Big Dipper</a>.\n\nA <a href=\"http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/happy-funny-girl-with-magnifying-glass-picture-id467073331?s=170667a&amp;w=1007\">careful eye</a> will also discern the faint \n<a href=\"ap170212.html\">green coma</a> of \n<a href=\"ap181216.html\">Comet Wirtanen</a>. \n\nTonight is the peak of the modest \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrids\">Lyrid meteor shower</a>, with several meteors per hour visible from dark locations with clear skies.",
