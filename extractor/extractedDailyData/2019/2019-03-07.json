  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNormally faint and elusive, the Jellyfish Nebula is caught in\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/389416/\">this alluring</a>\ntelescopic field of view.\n\nThe entire scene is a two panel mosaic constructed using narrowband\nimage data, with emission from sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen atoms\nshown in red, green and blue hues.\n\nIt's anchored right and left by two bright stars,\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/tejat.html\">Mu</a> and\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/propus.html\">Eta</a>\nGeminorum, at the foot of the\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/gem/index.html\">celestial\ntwin</a>.\n\n\nThe Jellyfish Nebula itself is right of center, the brighter arcing\nridge of emission with dangling tentacles.\n\nIn fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped\n<a href=\"ap060602.html\">supernova remnant IC 443</a>, the expanding\ndebris cloud from a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">massive\nstar that exploded</a>.\n\nLight from the explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years\nago.\n\nLike its cousin in\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2198\">astrophysical</a> waters the\n<a href=\"ap180317.html\">Crab Nebula</a>\nsupernova remnant, the Jellyfish Nebula is\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2000/1083/index.html\">known\nto harbor</a> a neutron star, the remnant of the collapsed stellar core.\n\nAn emission nebula cataloged as\n<a href=\"http://galaxymap.org/cat/list/sharpless/1\">Sharpless</a> 249\nfills the field at the upper left.\n\nThe Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away.\n\nAt that distance, this image would be about 300 light-years across.",
