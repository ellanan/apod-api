  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are these galaxies spinning so fast? \n\nIf you estimated each \n<a href=\"ap190629.html\">spiral</a>'s mass by how \nmuch light it emits, their fast rotations should \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs7x1Hu29Wc&amp;t=143s\">break them</a> apart. \n\nThe leading hypothesis as to why these galaxies don't break apart is \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/what-is-dark-matter.html\">dark matter</a> -- \nmass so dark we can't see it.\n\nBut <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2019/news-2019-54\">these galaxies</a> are even out-spinning this break-up limit -- \nthey are the \n<a href=\"ap170307.html\">fastest rotating disk galaxies known</a>. \n\nIt is therefore \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09080\">further hypothesized</a> \nthat their \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo\">dark matter halos</a> are so massive -- and their spins so fast -- \nthat it is harder for them to form stars than \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">regular spirals</a>.\n\nIf so, then these galaxies may be among the \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884L..11O/abstract\">most massive spirals</a> possible.\n\nFurther study of surprising super-spirals like these will continue, \nlikely including observations taken by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> \nscheduled for launch in 2021.",
