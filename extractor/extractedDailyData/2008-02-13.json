  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNGC 1132 is one smooth galaxy -- but how did it form?\n\nAs an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a>, \nNGC 1132 has little dust and gas, and few stars have formed in it recently.\n\nAlthough many elliptical galaxies are in clusters of galaxies, NGC 1132\nappears as a large, isolated galaxy toward the constellation of\nthe River (Eridanus).  \n\nTo probe the history of this intriguing trillion-star ball, astronomers imaged \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2008/07/caption.html\">NGC 1132</a> in both \nvisible light with the \n<a href=\"ap021124.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/xrays.html\">X-ray light</a> with the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/07/image/c/\">In this composite</a> false-color image, visible light is white, \nwhile the X-ray light is blue and indicates the unusual\npresence of very hot gas.  \n\nThe X-ray light also likely traces out the location of \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/darkmatter.html\">dark\nmatter</a>.\n\nOne progenitor hypothesis is that NGC 1132 is the result of a series of \n<a href=\"ap040612.html\">galaxy mergers</a> in what once was a small \n<a href=\"ap001113.html\">group of galaxies</a>. \n\nNGC 1132 is over 300 million light years away, so the light we see\nfrom it today left before \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs\">dinosaurs</a>\nroamed the Earth.   \n\nMany \n<a href=\"ap040309.html\">fascinating background galaxies</a>\ncan be seen far in the distance.",
