  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow were these unusual Martian spherules created? \n\nThousands of \n<a href=\"ap040210.html\">unusual gray spherules</a>, made of \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/26.html\">iron</a> and rock but dubbed \n<a href=\"http://www.wildblueberries.net/bluehistory.html\">blueberries</a>, were found embedded in and \n<a href=\"ap040204.html\">surrounding rocks</a> near the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/22jan_meridianiplanum.htm\">landing site</a> of the robot \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html\">Opportunity rover</a> on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>.  \n\nTo help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a \nsurface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was \n<a href=\"ap040216.html\">rich in the Martian orbs</a>.  \n\nThe Berry Bowl is \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05634\">pictured above</a>, imaged during rover's \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/opportunity_p048.html\">48th Sol</a> on Mars.  \n\nThe average diameter of a blueberry is only about 4 millimeters.  \n\nBy analyzing a circular patch in the rock surface to the \nleft of the densest patch of spherules, \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/mar-25-2004/captions/image-2.html\">Opportunity obtained</a> \ndata showing that the underlying rock has a much different \ncomposition than the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast28mar_1.htm\">hematite</a> rich blueberries.  \n\nThis <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040318a.html\">information</a> contributes to the growing \nconsensus is that these small, strange, \ngray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of\n<a href=\"ap040303.html\">dirty water</a>.",
