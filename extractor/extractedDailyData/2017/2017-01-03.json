  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat do the craters of Saturn's small moon Pandora look like up close?  \n\nTo help find out, NASA sent the \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a>, now orbiting Saturn, past the unusual moon two weeks ago.\n\nThe highest resolution image of \n<a href=\"ap051123.html\">Pandora</a> ever taken was then captured from about 40,000 kilometers out and is \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21055\">featured here</a>.  \n\nStructures as small as 300 meters can be discerned on 80-kilometer wide \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/Pandora\">Pandora</a>.  \n\nCraters on \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008DPS....40.4504M\">Pandora</a> appear to be covered over by some sort of material, \nproviding a more smooth appearance than sponge-like \n<a href=\"ap051003.html\">Hyperion</a>, another small moon of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nCurious <a href=\"ap041120.html\">grooves</a> and \n<a href=\"ap020602.html\">ridges</a> \nalso appear to cross the surface of the small moon.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora\">Pandora</a> \nis partly interesting because, along with its companion moon \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus\">Prometheus</a>, \nit helps shepherd the particles of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#F_Ring\">Saturn's F ring</a> \ninto a distinct ring.",
