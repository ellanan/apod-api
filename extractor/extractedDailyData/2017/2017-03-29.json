  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://sguisard.astrosurf.com/Pagim/M42-4LGS.html\">Four\nlaser beams</a> cut across this startling image of the\nOrion Nebula, as seen from ESO's Paranal Observatory in\nthe Atacama desert on\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/index.html\">planet Earth</a>.\n\nNot part of an <a href=\"ap120421.html\">interstellar</a> conflict,\nthe lasers are being used for an observation of Orion\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1613b/\">by UT4</a>,\none of the observatory's very large telescopes,\nin a technical test of an\n<a href=\"ap150507.html\">image-sharpening</a>\nadaptive optics system.\n\nThis view of the nebula with laser beams was\ncaptured by a small telescope from outside the UT4 enclosure.\n\nThe beams are visible from that perspective because in the\nfirst few kilometers above the observatory the Earth's dense\nlower atmosphere scatters the laser light.\n\nThe four small segments appearing beyond the beams are emission\nfrom an atmospheric layer of sodium atoms excited by the laser light\nat higher altitudes of 80-90 kilometers.\n\nSeen from the perspective of the UT4, those segments form bright\nspots or artificial guide stars.\n\nTheir fluctuations are used in real-time to correct for\natmospheric blurring along the line-of-sight by controlling a\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDGvNyVApgg\">deformable mirror</a>\nin the telescope's optical path.",
