  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo, this is not a good way to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQR0bXO_yI8\">get to the Moon</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon#NASA_association\">.</a>\n\nWhat is pictured is a chance superposition of an airplane and the Moon.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap041013.html\">contrail</a> would normally appear white, \nbut the large volume of air toward the setting Sun preferentially \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html\">knocks away blue light</a>, giving the reflected \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail\">trail</a> a bright red hue.  \n\nFar in the distance, to the right of the plane, is the \n<a href=\"ap050513.html\">young Moon</a>.  \n\nThis <a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/moon\">vast world</a> \nshows only a sliver of itself because the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun\">Sun</a> \nis nearly lined up behind it. \n\nCaptured two weeks ago, \nthe <a href=\"http://vjac.free.fr/skyshows/conjunctions/17mai2007/slides/0148.html\">featured image</a> was framed by an eerie maroon sky, \ntoo far from day to be blue, too far from night to be black.  \n\nWithin minutes the \nimpromptu sky show ended.  \n\nThe plane crossed the Moon. The contrail dispersed.  The Sun set.  The Moon set.  \n\nThe sky faded to black, only to \n<a href=\"ap070508.html\">reveal thousands of stars</a> that had been \ntoo faint to see through the rustic red din.",
