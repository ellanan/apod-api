  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWho are the twins of Gemini?\n\nIt terms of astronomical objects, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)\">famous constellation</a> is dominated by two bright stars: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollux_(star)\">Pollux</a> (left) and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_(star)\">Castor</a> (right).  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DeepSkyColors/photos/a.511542708913047.1073741828.511507152249936/1311821665551810/?type=3&amp;theater\">Pictured</a>, \nthe two stars stand out because they are so bright, \n<a href=\"ap170123.html\">so close together</a> \nboth in angle and brightness, but so different in color.\n\nPollux, at 33 light years distant, is an evolved red giant star twice as massive as our Sun.\n\nCastor, at 51 light years distant, is a blue main sequence \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">star</a> about 2.7 times more massive that our Sun. \n\nCastor is known to have at least two \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_(star)#The_Castor_System\">stellar companions</a>, while Pollux is now known to be circled by at least one \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollux_b\">massive planet</a>. \n\nIn terms of ancient \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy\">Babylonian</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology\">Greek</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology\">Roman</a> mythology, Castor and Pollux \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)#Mythology\">represent</a> twin brothers.\n\nCurrently, the Earth's orbit is causing the Sun to appear to shift in front of the constellation of Gemini, with the result that, for much of humanity, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXUon8x1B3A\">Castor and Pollux</a> \nwill remain visible toward the west at sunset for only a few more weeks.",
