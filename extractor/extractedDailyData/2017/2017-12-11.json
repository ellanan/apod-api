  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it be like to fly over the planet Mercury?\n\nImages and data taken from NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/About/Spacecraft-and-Instruments.html#spacecraft\">MESSENGER</a> spacecraft that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">orbited Mercury</a> from 2011 to 2015 have been digitally combined to envision a virtual flight that highlights much of the hot planet's surface. \n\nIn general, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury\">the Solar System's innermost world</a> appears similar to \n<a href=\"ap130716.html\">Earth's Moon</a> as it is covered by a heavily cratered gray terrain.\n\n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/index.html#top10\">MESSENGER discovered much</a> \nabout Mercury including that shadows near its poles likely host water ice. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-sk_cH6MXc\">featured video</a> opens as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)\">Mercury</a> is viewed from the Sun-facing side and concludes with the virtual spacecraft \n<a href=\"ap130805.html\">retreating</a> into Mercury's night. \n\nMercury actually <a href=\"ap130612.html\">rotates</a> so slowly that it only completes three rotations for every two trips around the Sun. \n\nIn 2018, Europe and Japan plan to launch \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BepiColombo\">BepiColombo</a> \nto better map Mercury's surface and \n<a href=\"https://img.thewebawards.com/1000/6/A-Dog-In-The-Dish-Washer.jpg\">probe</a> its \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGAbuTrm_bI\">magnetic field</a>.",
