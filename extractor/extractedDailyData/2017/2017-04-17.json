  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could watch the night sky for one million years -- how would it change?\n\nBesides local effects caused by the \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">Earth's spin</a> and the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Northern_pole_stars\">reorientation</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession#Changing_pole_stars\">Earth's spin axis</a>, the stars themselves will move.\n\nCombining positional data of unprecedented accuracy for two-million stars taken over years by \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA\">ESA</a>'s \nEarth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/hipparcos/\">Hipparcos</a> (now defunct) and \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/gaia/28820-summary/\">Gaia</a> satellites, \na future extrapolation of star movements was made over millions years.\n\nAs shown in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4xuA-OeaBc\">featured video</a>, \nmany stars make only small angular adjustments, but some stars \n-- typically those nearby -- will zip across the sky. \n\nOnce familiar \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/dr-marc-space/en/#/review/dr-marc-space/constellations.html\">constellations</a> and \n<a href=\"ap160123.html\">asterisms</a> will become \nun<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/7e/ESA_Gaia_TGAS_Rectangular_Annotated_1280px.jpg\">recognizable</a> \nas the bright stars that formed them move around. \n\nNot shown are many local nebulas that will surely \n<a href=\"ap011227.html\">dissipate</a> while new ones will likely form in different places. \n\nPerhaps reassuringly, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">future Earth inhabitants</a> will still be able to recognize the \n<a href=\"ap110710.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/620057main_milkyway_full.jpg\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.",
