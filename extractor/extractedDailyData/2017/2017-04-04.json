  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happened to the sky?\n\nSeveral common features of the \n<a href=\"ap010728.html\">daytime sky</a> \nare interacting in uncommon ways. \n\nFirst, well behind the \n<a href=\"ap160831.html\">silhouetted</a> hills, is the typically bright \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun\">Sun</a>. \n\nIn front of the Sun are thin clouds, \npossibly the home to a layer of \n<a href=\"https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/interviews/weird-world-water-nanoscale\">hexagonal ice crystals</a> that together are creating the \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circular.htm\">22 degree halo</a> of light \n<a href=\"ap150403.html\">surrounding the Sun</a>.\n\nThe unusual bent line that crosses the image is a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail\">contrail</a> -- a type of cloud created by a passing airplane.\n\nMuch of the \n<a href=\"ap041013.html\">contrail</a> must actually be \nfurther away than the thin cloud because it casts a shadow onto the cloud, \ngiving an unusual \n<a href=\"http://mathinsight.org/applet/vector_3d_coordinates\">three-dimensional</a> \nquality to the featured image.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alexandermaragos/photos/a.158353357515646.36723.142915525726096/1511911245493177/?type=3&amp;theater\">featured image</a> was taken in late January in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFsZrVzAJjc\">city</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patras\">Patras</a> in West \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>.",
