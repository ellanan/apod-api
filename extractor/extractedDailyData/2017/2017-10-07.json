  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWe live in an era where\n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/SEphoto/TSE2017/TSE2017galleryA.html\">total\nsolar eclipses</a> are possible because at times\nthe apparent size of the Moon can just cover the disk of the Sun.\n\nBut the Moon is slowly moving away from planet Earth.\n\nIts distance is\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/\nlroc-20100413-apollo15-LRRR.html\">measured</a>\nto\n<a href=\"http://tmurphy.physics.ucsd.edu/apollo/basics.html\">increase</a>\nabout 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) per year due to tidal friction.\n\nSo there will come a time, about\n<a href=\"https://astrobob.areavoices.com/2012/05/20/\n561667292-a-d-date-of-earths-last-solar-eclipse/\">600 million years from\nnow</a>, when the Moon is far enough away that the lunar disk will\nbe too small to ever completely cover the Sun.\n\nThen, at best only annular eclipses, a ring of fire surrounding\nthe silhouetted disk of the too small Moon, will be seen from\nthe surface of <a href=\"ap160907.html\">our fair planet</a>.\n\nOf course the Moon was slightly closer and loomed a little larger\n100 million years ago.\n\nSo during the age of the dinosaurs there were more frequent\ntotal eclipses of the Sun.\n\nIn front of the\n<a href=\"https://www.caspercollege.edu/tate-geological-museum\">Tate\nGeological Museum</a> at Casper College in Wyoming,\nthis dinosaur statue posed with a\n<a href=\"ap170901.html\">modern total eclipse</a>, though.\n\nAn automated camera was placed under him to shoot his portrait\nduring the <a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/SEphoto/TSE2017/\nTSE2017report.html\">Great American Eclipse of August 21</a>.",
