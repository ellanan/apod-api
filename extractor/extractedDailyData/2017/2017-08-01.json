  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Perseid Meteor Shower, usually the best meteor shower of the year, will peak late next week.   \n\nA person watching a clear sky from a dark location might see a bright meteor every minute.  \n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-perseid-meteor-shower\">These meteors</a> are actually specks of rock that have broken off \n<a href=\"ap960219.html\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a> \nand continued to \n<a href=\"https://www.meteorshowers.org/#Perseids\">orbit the Sun</a> \nuntil they vaporize in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/atmosphere_for_full_export-.jpg\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nThe featured composite image shows a outburst of Perseids \nas they appeared over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a> \nduring last year's \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/en/\">meteor shower</a>. \n\nEnough meteors were captured to trace the \n<a href=\"ap151213.html\">shower's radiant</a> back to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)\">constellation of Perseus</a> on the far left. \n\nThe tail-end of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseids</a> \nwill still be going during the \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/\">total solar eclipse on August 21</a>, \ncreating a rare opportunity for some lucky astrophotographers to image a \n<a href=\"ap160811.html\">Perseid meteor</a> during the day.",
