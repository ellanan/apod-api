  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens when a black hole devours a star? \n\nMany details remain unknown, but recent observations are providing new clues.\n\nIn 2014, a \n<a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa6003\">powerful explosion</a> was recorded by the ground-based robotic telescopes of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml\">All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae</a> (ASAS-SN) project, \nand followed up by instruments including \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov\">NASA</a>'s Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/spacecraft/\">Swift satellite</a>.\n\nComputer modeling of these emissions fit a star being ripped apart by a distant \n<a href=\"ap130312.html\">supermassive black hole</a>. \n\nThe results of such a collision are portrayed in the \n<a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2017/black-hole-choking-stardust-0315\">featured artistic illustration</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html\">black hole</a> itself is a depicted as a tiny black dot in the center.\n\nAs matter falls toward the hole, it collides with other matter and \n<a href=\"http://stronggravity.eu/public-outreach-tmp/accretion-disks/\">heats up</a>.\n\nSurrounding the black hole is an \n<a href=\"ap050312.html\">accretion disk</a> \nof hot matter that used to be the star, with a \n<a href=\"ap131120.html\">jet</a> emanating from the \n<a href=\"ap011029.html\">black hole's spin axis</a>.",
