  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWatch a huge lightning storm move across the eastern USA.\n\nThe huge storm caused much damage and unfortunately some loss of life for people in its path.\n\nSeen from space, the \n<a href=\"ap161205.html\">lightning</a> is seen as momentary flashes in the featured\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxJTQuWISbk\">time-lapse video</a> \nrecorded last month by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/first-its-kind-geostationary-lightning-mapper-glm-instrument-complete\">Geostationary Lightning Mapper</a> (GLM) aboard the \n<a href=\"http://www.goes-r.gov/\">GOES-16</a> satellite.\n\nThe outline of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a> \nis most evident during the day, while the bright \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/lightning-safety/\">lightning strikes</a> \nare most evident at night. \n\nInspection of the video shows that much of the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QAZeR6GGfw\">lightning occurred</a> \nat the leading edge of the huge tail of the swirling storm. \n\nBecause <a href=\"ap120723.html\">lightning</a> \nfrequently precedes a storm's most violent impact, \n<a href=\"https://lightning.nsstc.nasa.gov/primer/\">lightning</a> data from \n<a href=\"http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/geostationary-operational-environmental-satellite-r-series--goes.html\">GLM</a> \nholds promise to help reduce the harm to humans from future storms.",
