  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSeven worlds orbit the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1,\na mere 40 light-years away.\n\n<a href=\"ap160507.html\">In May 2016</a>\nastronomers using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals\nSmall Telescope (TRAPPIST) announced the discovery of three\nplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/\nnasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-\nhabitable-zone-planets-around\">Just announced</a>,\nadditional confirmations and discoveries by the\nSpitzer Space Telescope and supporting ESO ground-based telescopes\nhave increased the number of known planets to\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/\neso1706/eso1706a.pdf\">seven</a>.\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21425\">TRAPPIST-1\nplanets</a> are likely all rocky and\nsimilar in size to Earth, the largest\n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/\">treasure\ntrove of terrestrial planets</a> ever detected around\na single star.\n\nBecause they orbit very close to their faint, tiny star\nthey could also have regions where surface temperatures\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00616\">allow for the presence</a>\nof liquid water, a key ingredient for life.\n\n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2159/\">Their\ntantalizing proximity</a>\nto Earth makes them prime candidates for future\ntelescopic explorations of the atmospheres of\npotentially habitable planets. \n\nAll seven worlds appear in\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/\n6278-ssc2017-01d-Transit-Illustration-of-TRAPPIST-1\">this artist's\nillustration</a>, an imagined view from a\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/\nseven-earth-size-exoplanets-discovered\">fictionally powerful</a>\ntelescope near planet Earth.\n\nPlanet sizes and relative positions are drawn to scale for\nthe Spitzer observations.\n\nThe system's inner planets are transiting\ntheir dim, red, nearly Jupiter-sized parent star.",
