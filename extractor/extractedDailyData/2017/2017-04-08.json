  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLike a ship plowing through cosmic seas,\n<a href=\"ap061124.html\">runaway star</a> Zeta Ophiuchi\nproduces the arcing interstellar bow wave or bow shock seen in this\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/\nmultimedia/pia16604.html\">stunning infrared portrait</a>.\n\nIn the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more\nmassive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving\ntoward the left at 24 kilometers per <i>second</i>.\n\nIts strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty\n<a href=\"http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar\nmaterial</a> and shaping the curved shock front.\n\nWhat set this star in motion?\n\nZeta Oph was likely once a member of a\n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star system</a>, its\ncompanion star was more massive and hence\nshorter lived.\n\nWhen the companion\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova\">exploded\nas a supernova</a> catastrophically losing mass,\nZeta Oph was flung out of the system.\n\nAbout 460 light-years away, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Ophiuchi\">Zeta Oph</a>\nis 65,000 times more\nluminous than the Sun and would be one of the brighter stars\nin the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring dust.\n\nThe image spans about 1.5 degrees or 12 \n<a href=\" https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/Numbers/Math/\nMathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light-years</a>\nat the estimated distance of\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/zetaoph.html\">Zeta\nOphiuchi</a>.",
