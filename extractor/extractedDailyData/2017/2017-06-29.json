  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA long recognized naked-eye\n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/vsots_raqr\">variable star, R Aquarii</a>\nis actually an interacting binary star system, two\nstars that seem to have a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2017/raqr/\">close,\nsymbiotic relationship</a>.\n\nAbout 710 light years away, it consists of a cool red giant star\nand hot, dense white dwarf star in mutual orbit around their common\ncenter of mass.\n\nThe binary system's visible light is dominated by the red giant,\nitself a <a href=\"ap070817.html\">Mira-type long period</a> variable star.\n\nBut material in the cool giant star's extended envelope is pulled by gravity\nonto the surface of the smaller, denser white dwarf,\n<a href=\"ap060726.html\">eventually triggering</a>\na thermonuclear explosion and blasting material into space.\n\nOptical image data (red) shows the still expanding ring of debris\noriginating from a blast that would have been seen in the early 1770s.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2017/raqr/animations.html\">The\nevolution of</a> less understood energetic events producing\nhigh energy emission in the R Aquarii system has been\nmonitored since 2000 using Chandra X-ray Observatory data (blue).\n\nThe composite field of view is less that a light-year across at the\nestimated distance of R Aquarii.",
