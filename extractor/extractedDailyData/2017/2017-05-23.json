  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to approach Jupiter?\n\nTo help answer this, a team of 91 amateur \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2017/201170509-journey-to-jupiter.html\">astrophotographers took over 1,000 pictures</a> \nof Jupiter from the Earth with the resulting images aligned and digitally merged into the featured time-lapse video.\n\nImage taking began in 2014 December and lasted just over three months.\n\nThe resulting fictitious approach sequence has similarities to what was seen by NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-juno-k4.html\">Juno spacecraft</a> as it \n<a href=\"ap160701.html\">first approached</a> the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/Jupiter\">Jovian world</a> last July. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_UaOhvLUYA\">The video</a> \nbegins with Jupiter appearing as a small orb near the image center. \n\nAs Jupiter nears from below, the planet looms ever larger while the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZc1Y662jtk\">rotation of its cloud bands</a> \nbecomes apparent. \n\nJupiter's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/15may_grs\">shrinking Great Red Spot</a> rotates into view twice, at times showing \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2017/201170509-journey-to-jupiter.html\">unusual</a>\n<a href=\"http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/5-jupiter/2017/20170508_Fig-13_Crop-GRS-02b.gif\">activity</a>.\n\nMany <a href=\"ap170228.html\">white ovals</a> are visible moving around the giant planet.\n\nThe video ends as the imaginary spacecraft passes over Jupiter's North Pole.",
