  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA darkened sky holds bright planet Venus, the New Moon in\nsilhouette, and the shimmering\n<a href=\"ap990819.html\">corona of the Sun</a>\nin this image of a total solar eclipse.\n\nA composite of simultaneous telephoto and wide angle frames it was taken\nin the path of totality 18 years ago,\n<a href=\"http://newton.physics.metu.edu.tr/~aat/tunc/tezel.html\">August 11,\n1999, near Kastamonu, Turkey</a>.\n\nThat particular solar eclipse is a member of Saros 145.\n\nKnown <a href=\"ap130120.html\">historically</a>\nfrom observations of the Moon's orbit,\n<a href=\"http://www.eclipsewise.com/solar/SEhelp/SEsaros.html\">the\nSaros cycle predicts</a> when the Sun, Earth, and Moon will return to\nthe same geometry for a solar (or lunar) eclipse.\n\nThe Saros has a period of 18 years, 11 and 1/3 days.\n\nEclipses separated by one Saros period belong to the same numbered\nSaros series and are very similar.\n\nBut the path of totality for consecutive solar eclipses\nin the same Saros shifts across the Earth because the planet\nrotates for an additional 8 hours during the cycle's\nfractional day.\n\nSo the next solar eclipse\n<a href=\"http://www.eclipsewise.com/solar/SEsaros/SEsaros145.html\">of\nSaros 145</a> will also be a total eclipse,\nand the narrow path of totality will track coast to coast across the\n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/\">United States on August 21, 2017</a>.",
