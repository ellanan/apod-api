  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn this beautiful\n<a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/\nn2170.shtml\">celestial still life</a>\ncomposed with a cosmic brush, dusty nebula\n<a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/ngc/revngcic.cgi?NGC2170\">NGC 2170</a> shines at the upper left.\n\nReflecting the light of nearby hot stars, NGC 2170\n<a href=\"image/0608/ngc2170_seip_f56lbl.jpg\">is joined</a>\nby other bluish <a href=\"ap041204.html\">reflection</a> nebulae,\na compact red <a href=\"ap040629.html\">emission</a> region,\nand streamers of obscuring dust against a backdrop of stars.\n\nLike the common household items\nstill life painters often choose for their subjects,\nthe clouds of gas, dust, and hot stars\npictured here are also commonly found in this setting - \na massive, <a href=\"ap101015.html\">star-forming molecular cloud</a>\nin the constellation of the Unicorn (<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/mon/index.html\">Monoceros</a>).\n\nThe giant\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/GMC.html\">molecular\ncloud</a>, Mon R2, is impressively close,\n<a href=\"http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2005A%26A...430..523W\">estimated</a>\nto be only 2,400 light-years or so away.\n\nAt that distance, this canvas would be about 15 light-years across.",
