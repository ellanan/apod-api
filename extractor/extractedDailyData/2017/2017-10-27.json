  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Old_Astronomer\">As far as\nghosts go</a>, Mirach's Ghost isn't really that\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween\">scary</a>.\n\nMirach's Ghost is just a faint, fuzzy galaxy, well known to astronomers,\nthat happens to be seen nearly along the line-of-sight to\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/Sow/mirach.html\">Mirach</a>,\na bright star.\n\n<a href=\"ap150926.html\">Centered in</a> this star field,\nMirach is also called Beta\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Andromeda.html\">Andromedae</a>.\n\nAbout 200 light-years distant, \nMirach is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant\">red\ngiant</a> star, cooler than the Sun but\nmuch larger and so intrinsically much brighter than our\nparent star.\n\nIn most telescopic views, glare and\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike\">diffraction\nspikes</a> tend to hide things that lie near Mirach and make the\nfaint, fuzzy galaxy\nlook like a ghostly internal reflection of the almost\noverwhelming starlight.\n\nStill, appearing in\n<a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/image/166334529\">this sharp image</a>\njust above and to the left of Mirach, Mirach's Ghost is cataloged as\ngalaxy <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4985\">NGC 404</a>\nand is estimated\nto be some 10 million light-years away.",
