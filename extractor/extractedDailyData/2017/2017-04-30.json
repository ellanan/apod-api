  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis is what Saturn looks like from inside the rings.\n\nLast week, for the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQmTdYPVJxM\">first time</a>, NASA directed the \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> \nto swoop between Saturn and its rings.\n\nDuring <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2017/0428-trusty-cassini-survives-first.html\">the dive</a>, \nthe robotic spacecraft took hundreds of images showing \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-spacecraft-dives-between-saturn-and-its-rings\">unprecedented detail</a> for structures in Saturn's atmosphere.\n\nLooking back out, however, the spacecraft was also able to capture impressive vistas.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://saturnraw.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/casJPGFullS99/W00106712.jpg\">featured image</a> taken a few hours before closest approach, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/Saturn\">Saturn</a>'s unusual northern <a href=\"ap130220.html\">hexagon</a> is seen surrounding the North Pole.\n\nSaturn's B ring is the closest visible, while the dark \n<a href=\"ap161124.html\">Cassini Division</a> separates B from the outer A. \n\nA <a href=\"https://ivereadthis.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/cat-with-book-1.jpg\">close inspection</a> will find the \n<a href=\"ap160108.html\">two</a> small \n<a href=\"ap170103.html\">moons</a> that \n<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/PIA07712_-_F_ring_animation.ogv\">shepherd</a> the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#F_Ring\">F-ring</a>, \nthe farthest ring discernable. \n\nThis image is \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/raw-images/\">raw</a> and will be officially verified, calibrated and released at a later date.  \n\nCassini remains on schedule to \n<a href=\"ap170125.html\">end its mission</a> \nby plunging into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15.",
