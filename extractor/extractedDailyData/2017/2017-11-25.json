  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFollow this vertical panoramic view from horizon to horizon and\nyour gaze will sweep through the zenith of a dark night sky over\n<a href=\"ap080125.html\">Pic du Midi mountaintop</a> observatory.\n\nTo make the journey above a sea of clouds,\n19 single exposures were taken near the end\nof night on October 31 and assembled in a mercator projection\nthat renders the two horizons flat.\n\nBegin at the top and you're looking east toward the upsidedown dome of\nthe observatory's 1 meter telescope.\n\nIt's easy to follow the plane of\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/\ncharting-the-milky-way-from-the-inside-out\">our Milky Way</a> galaxy as it\nappears to emerge from the dome and angle down toward the far horizon.\n\nJust to its right, the sky holds a remarkable diffuse glow of zodiacal\nlight along our Solar System's ecliptic plane.\n\n<a href=\"ap140911.html\">Zodiacal light</a>\nand Milky Way with star clusters, cosmic dust clouds\nand faint nebulae, cross near the zenith.\n\nBoth continue down toward the airglow in the west.\n\nThey disappear near the western horizon at the bottom, beyond\nmore Pic du Midi observatory domes and a tall communications relay antenna.",
