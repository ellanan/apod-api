  "title": "A Hybrid Solar Eclipse over Kenya",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nChasing solar eclipses can cause you to go to the most interesting places and meet the most interesting people. \n\nAlmost. \n\nFor example, chasing this eclipse brought this astrophotographer to Kenya in 2013.\n\nHis contact, a member of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people\">Maasai people</a>, \nwas to pick him up at the airport, show him part of southern Kenya, and even agreed to pose in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people#/media/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_105-DOA0556,_Deutsch-Ostafrika,_Massaikrieger.jpg\">traditional warrior garb</a> \non a hill as the hopefully \n<a href=\"ap130509.html\">spectacular eclipse</a> set far in background. \n\nUnfortunately, this contact person died unexpectedly \na week before the astrophotographer's arrival, \nand so he never got to participate in the shoot, \nnor know that the resulting image went on to win an \n<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/astronomy-photographer-of-the-year-2014-9741641.html\">international award for astrophotography</a>. \n\nPictured in 2013 from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya\">Kenya</a>, \nthe Moon covers much of the Sun during a \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.star.gs/english/hybrid.png\">hybrid eclipse</a>, \na <a href=\"ap131103.html\">rare type</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse#Types\">solar eclipse</a> \nthat appears as total from some Earth locations, but annular in others.\n\nDuring the <a href=\"ap160831.html\">annular</a> part of the eclipse, \nthe Moon was too far from the Earth to block the entire Sun. \n\nNext month a total solar eclipse \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/planning-your-eclipse-party\">will cross</a> the USA.",
