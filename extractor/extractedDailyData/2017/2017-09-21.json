  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Moon, three planets, and a bright star gathered near the\n<a href=\"ap151126.html\">ecliptic plane</a>\nin the September 18 morning\n<a href=\"ap140823.html\">sky over Veszprem</a> Castle, Hungary.\n\nIn this twilight skyscape,\n<a href=\"image/1709/conjunction_170918_ladanyi_en.jpg\">Mercury\nand Mars</a> still shine close to the\neastern horizon, soon to disappear in the glare of the Sun.\n\nRegulus, alpha star of the constellation Leo, is the bright point\nnext to a waning crescent Moon, with brilliant Venus near the top\nof the frame.\n\nThe beautiful morning conjunction of Moon, planets, and bright star\ncould generally be followed by early morning risers all around\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">planet Earth</a>.\n\nBut remarkably, the\n<a href=\"http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecA/olist17.html\">Moon\nalso occulted</a>, or passed directly in front of, Regulus and each of the\nthree planets within 24 hours, all on September 18 UT.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/\noccultations-galore-on-september-18\">Visible from</a> different\nlocations, timing and watching the\nlunar occultations was much more difficult though, and mostly required\nviewing in daytime skies.",
