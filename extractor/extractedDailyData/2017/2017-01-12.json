  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n0891.html\">\nLarge spiral galaxy NGC 891</a> spans about 100 thousand light-years\nand is seen almost exactly edge-on from our perspective.\n\nIn fact, about 30 million light-years distant in the constellation\nAndromeda, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0461\">NGC 891 looks</a> a\nlot like our <a href=\"ap000130.html\">Milky Way</a>.\n\nAt first glance, it has a\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/ngc891.html\">flat,\nthin, galactic disk of stars</a> and\na central bulge cut along the middle by\nregions of dark <a href=\"ap090615.html\">obscuring dust</a>.\n\nBut remarkably apparent in NGC 891's\n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">edge-on presentation</a> are filaments\nof dust that extend hundreds of\nlight-years above and below the center line.\n\nThe dust has likely been blown out of the disk\nby supernova explosions or intense\nstar formation activity.\n\nFainter galaxies can also be seen near the edge-on disk\nin this deep\n<a href=\"http://skycenter.arizona.edu/gallery/Galaxies/NGC891\">portrait\nof NGC 891</a>.\n\n(<i>Editor's Note:</i>\nThe NGC 891 image used in today's APOD posting has been replaced\nand the credit corrected to indicate the author of the original\nwork.)",
