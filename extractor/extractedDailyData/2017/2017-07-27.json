  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThese three bright nebulae are often featured on telescopic tours of the\nconstellation <a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sgr/\nindex.html\">Sagittarius</a> and the crowded starfields of\nthe <a href=\"ap161110.html\">central Milky Way</a>.\n\nIn fact, 18th century cosmic tourist\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/history/biograph.html\">Charles\nMessier</a> cataloged two of them; \n<a href=\"ap160909.html\">M8</a>, the large nebula above and left of center,\nand colorful <a href=\"ap170628.html\">M20</a> near the bottom of the frame.\n\nThe third emission region includes\n<a href=\"ap040629.html\">NGC 6559</a>, right of M8 and\nseparated from the larger nebula by a dark dust lane.\n\nAll three are stellar nurseries about\nfive thousand light-years or so distant.\n\nOver a hundred light-years across the expansive M8\nis also known as the Lagoon Nebula.\n\nM20's popular moniker is the Trifid.\n\nGlowing hydrogen gas creates the dominant red color of the\nemission nebulae.\n\nIn striking contrast, blue hues in the\nTrifid are due to dust <a href=\"ap011228.html\">reflected starlight</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://astrodrudis.com/messier-8-messier-20-and-ic-4685/\">The\ncolorful composite skyscape</a> was recorded with two different\ntelescopes to capture a widefield image of the\narea and individual close-ups at higher resolution.",
