  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn July 3rd,\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/\nearth-farthest-from-sun-for-year-in-early-july\">planet Earth\nreached aphelion</a>, the farthest point in\nits elliptical orbit around the Sun.\n\nEach year, this day of the most distant Sun happens to occur\nduring winter in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThat's where this aphelion sunrise from 2015 was captured in a\ntime series composite against the skyline of Brisbane, Australia.\n\n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/pluto/2015/10/23/\na-planet-for-all-seasons/\">Of course, seasons</a>\nfor our fair planet are not determined by\ndistance to the Sun, but by the tilt of Earth's rotational axis\nwith respect to the ecliptic, the plane of its orbit.\n\n<a href=\"ap130802.html\">Fondly known</a> as the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nEcliptic#Obliquity_of_the_ecliptic\">obliquity of the ecliptic</a>,\nthe angle of the tilt\nis about 23.4 degrees from perpendicular to the orbital plane.\n\nSo the most distant sunrise occurs during northern summer, when\nthe planet's north pole is tilted toward the Sun\nand the north enjoys longer, warmer days.",
