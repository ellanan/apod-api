  "title": "Almost Three Tails for Comet Encke",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow can a comet have three tails?\n\nNormally, \na comet has \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_tail#/media/File:Cometorbit01.svg\">two tails</a>: an \n<a href=\"https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/smallbod/haltail.htm\">ion tail</a> \nof charged particles emitted by the comet and pushed out by the wind from the Sun, and a \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/reference_desk/faq/answer.php.id=19&amp;cat=solarsystem\">dust tail</a> of small debris that orbits behind the comet but is also pushed out, to some degree, by the solar wind. \n\nFrequently a comet will appear to have only \n<a href=\"ap131117.html\">one tail</a> \nbecause the other tail is not easily visible from the Earth. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/fhhemmerich/32923225095/in/pool-3084377@N22/\">featured unusual image</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke\">Comet 2P/Encke</a> appears to have <i> three </i> \ntails because the ion tail split just near to the time when the image was taken.\n\nThe complex solar wind is occasionally \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence\">turbulent</a> and sometimes creates \n<a href=\"ap020515.html\">unusual</a> \n<a href=\"ap020318.html\">structure</a> in an ion tail.\n\nOn rare occasions even \n<a href=\"ap071003.html\">ion-tail disconnection event</a>s have been recorded.\n\nAn image of the Comet Encke taken two days later gives a perhaps \n<a href=\"http://www.damianpeach.com/deepsky/2p_encke_2017_02_16dp.jpg\">less perplexing perspective</a>.",
