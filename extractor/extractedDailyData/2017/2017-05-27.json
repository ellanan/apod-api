  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSweeping through this stunning field of view,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71P/Clark\">Comet 71P/Clark</a>\nreally is in the foreground of these cosmic clouds.\n\nThe 2 panel telescopic mosaic is color enhanced and is about 5 degrees\n(10 full moons) across.\n\nIt captures the <a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/data/comets.php\">faint\ncomet's</a> position on the\nnight of May 23/24 over 5 light-minutes from Earth,\nvery near the line-of-sight to\n<a href=\"ap150222.html\">bright star Antares</a> and the\nRho Ophiuchi cloud complex.\n\nIn the frame\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/antares.html\">\nAntares</a>, also known as Alpha Scorpii, is at bottom center surrounded\nby a dusty cosmic cloud reflecting the cool giant star's yellowish light.\n\nGlobular star cluster M4 shines just right of Antares,\nbut M4 lies some 7,000 light-years away compared to Antares'\n500 light-year distance.\n\nSlightly closer than Antares, Rho Ophiuchi's bluish starlight is\nreflected by the dust in\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0005\">molecular clouds</a>\ntoward the top.\n\nYou can spot the small coma and short tail of the comet\nas a faint smudge near the center of the left edge of the frame.\n\nJust look for the comet's striking greenish color, produced as diatomic\ncarbon molecules fluoresce\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0759\">in sunlight</a>.",
