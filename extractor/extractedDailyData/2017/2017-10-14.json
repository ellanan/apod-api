  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/aurora_gallery.html\">Familiar\ngreen and red</a> tinted auroral emission floods the sky\nalong the northern (top) horizon in this\nfish-eye panorama projection from September 27.\n\nOn the mild, clear evening the Milky Way tracks through the zenith of\na southern Alberta sky and ends where the six-day-old Moon sets\nin the southwest.\n\nThe odd, isolated, pink and whitish arc across the south\nhas come to be known as Steve.\n\nThe name was given to the phenomenon by the\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AlbertaAuroraChasers/\">Alberta\nAurora Chasers</a> Facebook group who had recorded\nappearances of the aurora-like feature.\n\n<a href=\"ap150803.html\">Sometimes mistakenly</a>\nidentified as a proton aurora or proton arc,\nthe mysterious Steve arcs seem associated with aurorae but\nappear closer to the equator than the auroral curtains.\n\nWidely documented by\n<a href=\"http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=449\">citizen scientists</a>\nand recently directly explored by a\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/\nWhen_Swarm_met_Steve\">Swarm mission satellite</a>,\nSteve arcs have been measured as\nthermal emission from flowing gas rather than\nemission excited by energetic electrons.\n\nEven though a reverse-engineered acronym that fits the\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amwaFNZYUUY\">originally\nfriendly name</a> is Sudden Thermal Emission from Velocity Enhancement,\nhis origin is still mysterious.",
