  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMany details of Saturn appear clearly in infrared light. \n\nBands of clouds show great structure, including long \n<a href=\"ap110119.html\">stretching storms</a>. \n\nAlso quite striking in infrared is the unusual \n<a href=\"ap130220.html\">hexagonal cloud pattern</a> surrounding \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/Saturn\">Saturn</a>'s North Pole. \n\nEach side of the dark hexagon spans roughly the width of our Earth.\n\nThe hexagon's existence was not predicted, and its origin and likely stability remains a \n<a href=\"http://laplazagigi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dog-with-glasses.jpg\">topic of research</a>.  \n\nSaturn's famous \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/rings\">rings</a> \ncircle the planet and \n<a href=\"ap120703.html\">cast shadows</a> below the equator.\n\nThe featured image was taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> in 2014 in several \n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/discovery.html\">infrared</a> colors -- but only processed recently. \n\nIn September, \n<a href=\"ap110613.html\">Cassini's mission</a> will be brought to a \ndramatic conclusion as the spacecraft will be \n<a href=\"ap170125.html\">directed to dive</a> into ringed giant.",
