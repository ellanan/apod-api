  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nStart with the constellation of Orion. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1705a/\">Below Orion's belt</a> \nis a fuzzy area known as the Great Nebula of Orion. \n\nIn this nebula is a bright star cluster known as the \n<a href=\"ap050710.html\">Trapezium</a>, \nmarked by <a href=\"ap121006.html\">four bright stars</a> near the image center.\n\nThe newly born stars in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_Cluster\">Trapezium</a> and \n<a href=\"ap990202.html\">surrounding regions</a> show the \n<a href=\"ap170312.html\">Orion Nebula</a> \nto be one of the most active areas of star formation to be found in our area of \n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">the Galaxy</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/2017-11\">In Orion</a>, \nsupernova explosions and close interactions between stars have created \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet\">rogue planets</a> and stars that rapidly move through space.\n\nSome of these \n<a href=\"ap160522.html\">fast stars</a> have been found by \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/video/940/news_release/2017-11\">comparing different images</a> \nof this region taken by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> many years apart.\n\nMany of the stars in the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1705/\">featured image</a>, taken in visible and near-infrared light, appear \n<a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/46-our-solar-system/the-moon/observing-the-moon/142-why-are-the-moon-and-sun-sometimes-orange-or-red-beginner\">unusually red</a> \nbecause they are seen through \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> that scatters away much of their blue light.",
