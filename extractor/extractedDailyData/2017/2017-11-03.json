  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6983\">Traveling\nat high velocity</a> along an extreme hyperbolic orbit and making\na hairpin turn as it swung past the Sun,\nthe now designated A/2017 U1 is the first known\nsmall body from interstellar space.\n\nA point of light centered in this 5 minute exposure recorded\nwith the William Herschel Telescope in the Canary Islands on October 28, the\ninterstellar visitor is asteroid-like with\n<a href=\"http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K17/K17UI3.html\">no\nsigns of cometary activity</a>.\n\nFaint background stars appear streaked because the massive 4.2 meter\ndiameter telescope is tracking the rapidly moving A/2017 U1\nin the field of view.\n\nAstronomer Rob Weryk (IfA)\n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/interstellar/\">first\nrecognized</a> the moving object in nightly Pan-STARRS sky survey\ndata on October 19.\n\nA/2017 is presently outbound,\n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/\nastronomers-race-to-learn-from-first-interstellar-asteroid-ever-seen-1.22925\">never to return</a> to\nthe Solar System, and already only visible\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense\">from planet Earth</a>\nin large optical telescopes.\n\nThough an interstellar origin has been established based on its orbit,\nit is still unknown how long the object could have\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11364\">drifted among the\nstars of the Milky Way</a>.\n\nBut its interstellar cruise speed would be about 26 kilometers per\nsecond.\n\nBy comparison humanity's Voyager 1 spacecraft travels about 17\nkilometers per second\n<a href=\"ap170902.html\">through interstellar space</a>.",
