  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHave you ever wanted to be a gnomon?\n\nOf course, a gnomon is the tall part of a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial\">sundial</a>\nthat casts a shadow.\n\nThe gnomon's shadow moves as the Sun moves across the sky,\nindicating time by the shadow's position on the dial face.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.theskyinmotion.com/index.html?sundial19jul17.html\">So on\nJuly 19th</a>, the Astronomy Group of the Progymnasium Rosenfeld\ncreated a human sundial, each participant patiently playing the\nrole of the gnomon for 10 minutes.\n\nIn this timelapse video of their temporal\n<a href=\"ap031206.html\">voyage</a> of\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/mars/\ninterview-with-bill-nye-the-sundial-guy/\">discovery</a>, one image was\ntaken every 20 seconds from 8 am until 4 pm Central European Summer Time.\n\nDrawn on the ground are the dial hour marks calculated\nto show the local time for that specific date.\n\nBehind, the tower clock offers a time check.\n\nCan you find the local time of solar noon?\n\n(Hint: At solar noon the Sun is on the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(astronomy)\">meridan</a>.)\n\nThe persistent group plans a repetition of the\nhuman sundial performance next winter to compare the length\nof the day and the altitude of the Sun.",
