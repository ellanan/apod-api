  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNothing like it has ever been seen before.\n\nThe unusual space rock \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1737/\">'Oumuamua</a> \nis so intriguing mainly because it is the \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/astronomers-race-to-learn-from-first-interstellar-asteroid-ever-seen-1.22925\">first asteroid</a> ever detected from outside our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/kids/index.cfm\">Solar System</a> -- \nalthough likely many more are to follow given modern computer-driven sky monitoring.\n\nTherefore humanity's telescopes -- of nearly every variety -- have put \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2017-300\">'Oumuamua</a> \ninto their observing schedule to help better understand this unusual \n<a href=\"ap171103.html\">interstellar visitor</a>.\n\nPictured is an \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1737a/\">artist's illustration</a> of what \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua\">'Oumuamua</a> \nmight look like up close.\n\n'Oumuamua is also intriguing, however, because it has unexpected parallels to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama\">Rama</a>, \na famous fictional interstellar spaceship created by the late science fiction writer \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke\">Arthur C. Clarke</a>.\n\nLike Rama, 'Oumuamua is \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04927\">unusually elongated</a>, \nshould be made of strong material to avoid breaking apart, is \nonly passing through our Solar System, \nand passed unusually close to the Sun for something gravitationally unbound.\n\nUnlike a visiting spaceship, though, 'Oumuamua's \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/interstellar/\">trajectory</a>, \nspeed, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09977\">color</a>, and even \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11364\">probability of detection</a> \nare consistent with it forming naturally around a \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/normal_stars.html\">normal star</a> many millions of years ago, \nbeing expelled after gravitationally encountering a \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/\">normal planet</a>, \nand subsequently orbiting in our Galaxy alone.\n\nEven given \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbL1ZoAQgUU\">'Oumuamua</a>'s \nlikely conventional origin, perhaps \n<a href=\"ap141208.html\">humanity can hold hope</a> that one day we will have the technology to engineer 'Oumuamua -- or another Solar System interloper -- into an interstellar Rama of our own.",
