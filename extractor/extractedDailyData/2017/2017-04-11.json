  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was supposed to be a shot of trees in front of a setting Sun.\n\nSometimes, though, the unexpected can be photogenic.\n\nDuring some planning shots, a \n<a href=\"http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a97916_walk-pet_2-sweet.jpg\">man walking his dog</a> unexpected crossed the ridge.\n\nThe result was so striking that, after cropping, it became the main shot. \n\nThe reason the Sun \n<a href=\"http://starcircleacademy.com/tag/angular-size/\">appears so large</a> \nis that the image was taken from about a kilometer away through a telephoto lens. \n\nScattering of blue light by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/mos-upper-atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> makes the bottom of the Sun appear slightly \n<a href=\"http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-2/Blue-Skies-and-Red-Sunsets\">more red</a> that the top.\n\nAlso, if you look closely at \n<a href=\"ap120608.html\">the Sun</a>, just above the man's head, a large \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/images2017/02apr17/hmi1898.gif\">group of sunspots</a> \nis visible.\n\nThe image was taken just last week in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Llk64Zk-DP8\">Bad</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Mergentheim\">Mergentheim</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>.",
