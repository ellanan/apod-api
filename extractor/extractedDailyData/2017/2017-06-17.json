  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSaturn reached its 2017 opposition on June 16.\n\nOf course, opposition means opposite the Sun in Earth's sky and\n<a href=\"ap170610.html\">near opposition Saturn</a> is up all night,\nat its closest and brightest for the year.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peachastro/status/875394443305766912/\nphoto/1\">This remarkably sharp image</a> of the ringed planet was taken only\ndays before, on June 11,\nwith a 1-meter telescope from the mountain top\n<a href=\"ap080125.html\">Pic du Midi</a> observatory.\n\nNorth is at the top with the giant planet's north\n<a href=\"ap130502.html\">polar storm</a> and\n<a href=\"ap120122.html\">curious hexagon</a>\nclearly seen bathed in sunlight.\n\nBut Saturn's spectacular\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">ring system</a>\nis also shown in stunning detail.\n\nThe narrow Encke division is visible around the entire outer A ring,\nsmall ringlets can be traced within the fainter inner C ring, and\nSaturn's southern hemisphere can be glimpsed through the wider\nCassini division.\n\nNear opposition Saturn's rings also appear exceptionally bright,\nknown as the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_surge\">opposition\nsurge</a> or Seeliger Effect.\n\nDirectly illuminated from Earth's perspective, the ring's icy particles\ncast no shadows and strongly backscatter sunlight creating the dramatic\nincrease in brightness.\n\nStill,\n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturn-tour/\nwhere-is-cassini-now/\">the best views</a>\nof the ringed planet are currently\nfrom the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft.  \n\n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/\ngrand-finale-orbit-guide/\">Diving close</a>,\nCassini's Grand Finale orbit number 9\n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/\ngrand-finale-orbit-guide/#Orbit_09\">is in progress</a>.",
