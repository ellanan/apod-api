  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could stand on the surface of the newly discovered Earth-sized exoplanet TRAPPIST-1f, what would you see?\n\nPresently, no \n<a href=\"ap100725.html\">Earthling</a> knows for sure, but the \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21423\">featured illustration</a> depicts a reasoned guess based on observational data taken by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s Sun-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.\n\nIn 2017, four \n<a href=\"ap140303.html\">more Earth-sized planets</a> were found by Spitzer, including \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1f\">TRAPPIST-1f</a>, in addition to \n<a href=\"ap160507.html\">three discovered</a> in 2015 from the ground. \n\nFrom the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/6274-ssc2017-01c-Surface-of-TRAPPIST-1f\">planet's surface</a>, near the mild \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)\">terminator</a> \nbetween night and day, you might see water, ice, and rock on the ground, \nwhile water-based clouds might hover above.\n\nPast the clouds, the small central star \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1\">TRAPPIST-1</a> \nwould appear more red than our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun\">Sun</a>, \nbut angularly larger due to the close orbit.\n\nWith <a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/\">seven known</a> Earth-sized planets -- \nmany of which pass near each other -- the \n<a href=\"ap170223.html\">TRAPPIST-1 system</a> is not only a candidate to have life, but <i> intercommunicating </i> life -- although a \n<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/space/weird-planetary-system-seems-something-science-fiction-n724136\">preliminary search</a> has found no \n<a href=\"https://europasicewolf.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/howling-at-the-moon-hippotipus-dff_080723.jpg\">obvious transmissions</a>.",
