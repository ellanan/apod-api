  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe beautiful Andromeda Galaxy is often imaged by\nplanet Earth-based astronomers.\n\nAlso known as M31, the nearest large spiral galaxy is a familiar sight\nwith dark dust lanes, bright yellowish core, and\n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/phat/\">spiral arms traced</a> by\nblue starlight.\n\nA mosaic of well-exposed broad and narrow-band image data, this\n<a href=\"http://www.deepskycolors.com/Clouds_of_Andromeda.html\">colorful,\npremier portrait</a> of our\nneighboring <a href=\"ap051222.html\">island universe</a>\noffers strikingly unfamiliar\nfeatures though, faint reddish clouds of glowing\nionized hydrogen gas in the same wide field of view.\n\nStill, the <a href=\"ap051223.html\">ionized hydrogen</a> clouds likely\nlie in the foreground of the scene, well within our Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nThey could be associated with the pervasive, dusty\n<a href=\"ap151012.html\">interstellar cirrus</a>\nclouds scattered hundreds of light-years above our own galactic plane.\n\nIf they were located at the 2.5 million light-year distance of the\nAndromeda Galaxy they would be enormous,\nsince the Andromeda Galaxy itself is 200,000 or so light-years across.",
