  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nBoth gravitational and electromagnetic radiations have been detected in\nrapid succession for an explosive merging event for the first time. \n\nData from the outburst fit well with a spectacular binary neutron-star\ndeath-spiral. \n\nThe explosive episode was seen on August 17 in nearby \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4993\">NGC 4993</a>, an \n<a href=\"ap100520.html\">elliptical galaxy</a> only 130 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light\nyears</a> distant.\n\n<a href=\"ap160207.html\">Gravitational waves</a> were \n<a href=\"ap160211.html\">seen first</a> by the ground based \n<a href=\"http://ligo.org/science/faq.php\">LIGO</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.virgo-gw.eu/\">Virgo</a> observatories, \nwhile seconds later the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope\">Fermi</a> and\n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/integral/\">INTEGRAL</a>\nobservatories detected gamma-rays, and hours after that \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble</a> \nand other observatories detected light throughout the electromagnetic\nspectrum. \n\nPictured is an \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/x_Akn8fUBeQ\">animated illustrative movie</a> \nof the event's likely progenitors. \n\nThe video depicts hot \n<a href=\"ap110305.html\">neutron star</a>s as they \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=10543\">spiral in</a> toward each other and emit \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_astronomy\">gravitational radiation</a>.\n\nAs they merge, a powerful jet extends that drives the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989Natur.340..126E\">short-duration gamma-ray burst</a>, followed by clouds of ejecta and, \nover time, an optical supernova-type episode called a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilonova\">kilonova</a>. \n\nThis first coincident detection confirms that LIGO events can be\nassociated with \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst#Short_gamma-ray_bursts\">short-duration gamma-ray bursts</a>.\n\nSuch powerful neutron star mergers are thought to have \n<a href=\"http://blog.sdss.org/2017/01/09/origin-of-the-elements-in-the-solar-system/\">seeded the universe</a> with \n<a href=\"ap160125.html\">many heavy nuclei</a> including the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine#Biological_role\">iodine\nneeded for life</a> \nand the uranium and plutonium needed for \n<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=nuclear_home\">nuclear fission power</a>. \n\nYou may already own \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/a1/ef/a5a1ef30ef2823212b60b507f1e9f04f.jpg\">a souvenir</a> of one of these explosions -- they are also thought to be the \n<a href=\"ap171015.html\">original creators</a> of \n<a href=\"https://schiffgold.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ft-knox.jpg\">gold</a>.",
