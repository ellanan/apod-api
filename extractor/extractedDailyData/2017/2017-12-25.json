  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSomething very bright suddenly lit up the arctic -- what was it?\n\nThe original idea was to take a series of \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/\">aurora</a> \nimages that could be made into a \n<a href=\"ap130609.html\">time-lapse video</a>. \n\nBut when night suddenly turned into day, the astrophotographer quickly realized that he was seeing something even more spectacular.\n\nMoving through the sky -- in front of the \n<a href=\"ap171121.html\">Big Dipper</a> no less -- was a \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2017/heads-up-earthlings-the-geminids-are-here.html\">Geminid meteor</a> \nso bright it could be called a \n<a href=\"ap081125.html\">fireball</a>.\n\nThe meteor brightened and flashed for several seconds as it went. \n\nBy a stroke of good fortune, the aurora camera was able to capture the whole track.\n\nTaken the night after the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids\">Geminids Meteor Shower</a> \npeaked, the astrophotographer's location was near \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK1iYWxg-ww\">Lovozero Lake</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmansk\">Murmansk</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\">Russia</a>, just north of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle\">Arctic Circle</a>.",
