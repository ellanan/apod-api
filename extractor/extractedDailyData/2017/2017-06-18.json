  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat has the Cassini orbiter seen at Saturn?\n\nThe <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/24410924\">featured music video</a>\nshows some of the early highlights.\n\nIn the first time-lapse sequence (00:07), a vertical line appears that is really Saturn's\n<a href=\"ap110308.html\">thin rings</a> seen nearly edge-on.  \n\nSoon some of\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18015\">Saturn</a>'s\nmoon shoot past.  \n\nThe next sequence (00:11) features Saturn's unusually\n<a href=\"ap100802.html\">wavy F-ring</a> that is constrained by the two\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdUlpeUFfxI\">shepherd moons</a> that are also continually perturbing it.  \n\nSoon much of Saturn's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">extensive ring system</a> flashes by, sometimes juxtaposed to the grandeur of the immense planet itself.\n\nCloud patterns on\n<a href=\"ap060215.html\">Titan</a> (00:39) and\n<a href=\"ap050225.html\">Saturn</a> (00:41) are highlighted.\n\nClips from flybys of several of Saturn's moon are then shown, including\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/phoebe\">Phoebe</a>,\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mimas\">Mimas</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon)\">Epimetheus</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap090809.html\">Iapetus</a>.\n\nIn other sequences, moons of Saturn\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0701/ringcross_cassini.gif\">appear to pass</a> each other as they orbit Saturn.\n\nBackground star fields seen by Cassini are sometimes intruded upon by bright passing moons.\n\nThe robotic <a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> has been revolutionizing humanity's knowledge of Saturn and its moons <a href=\"ap971016.html\">since</a>\n<a href=\"ap040531.html\">2004</a>.\n\nIn September, \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/grand-finale-orbit-guide/\">Cassini's mission</a> will be brought to a \ndramatic conclusion as the spacecraft will be \n<a href=\"ap170125.html\">directed to dive</a> into ringed giant.",
