  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDid you ever get caught in a meteor shower?\n\nIf yes, then every minute or so the sky sparked with fleeting flashes of light.\n\nThis was the fate of the pictured astrophotographer during last year's Perseids \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/en/\">meteor shower</a>.\n\nDuring the <a href=\"http://twanight.org/newTwan/contest2017-2.asp\">featured three-hour image composite</a>, \nabout 90 Perseids rained down above Lake Duolun of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia\">Inner Mongolia</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>.\n\nIf you trace back the meteor streaks, you will find that most of them \n<a href=\"ap070812.html\">appear to radiate</a> from a single constellation -- in this case \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)\">Perseus</a>.\n\nIn fact, you can even tell which meteors are <i>not</i> \n<a href=\"ap170818.html\">Perseids</a> because they track differently.\n\nTonight promises to be another good night to get caught in a meteor shower because it is the <a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/geminid-shower-2017/\">peak for the Geminids</a>.\n\nGemini, the <a href=\"ap151217.html\">shower radiant</a>, \nshould rise shortly after sunset and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/video/jpl-20171201-whatsuf-0001-180cc.mp4\">be visible</a> most of the night.",
