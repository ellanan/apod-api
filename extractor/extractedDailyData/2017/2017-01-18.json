  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could circle the Earth aboard the International Space Station, what might you see?\n\nSome amazing vistas, one of which was captured in \n<a href=\"https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/photo.pl?mission=ISS044&amp;roll=E&amp;frame=45215\">this breathtaking picture</a> in mid-2015.\n\nFirst, visible at the top, are parts of the \n<a href=\"ap151109.html\">space station</a> itself including \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel\">solar panels</a>.\n\nJust below the station is the band of our \n<a href=\"ap160726.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, \nglowing with the combined light of billions of stars, \nbut dimmed in patches by filaments of \n<a href=\"ap141214.html\">dark dust</a>.\n\nThe band of red light just below the Milky Way is \n<a href=\"ap160322.html\">airglow</a> -- \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> excited by the \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/sun.html\">Sun</a> \nand glowing in specific colors of light. \n\nGreen <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow2.htm\">airglow</a> \nis visible below the red.\n\nOf course that's \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">our Earth</a> below its air, with the \n<a href=\"ap150427.html\">terminator</a> between day and night visible near the horizon. \n\nAs clouds speckle the planet, illumination from a bright \n<a href=\"ap120723.html\">lightning bolt</a> is seen toward the lower right. \n\nBetween work assignments, \n<a href=\"https://astronauts.nasa.gov/\">astronauts</a> from all over the Earth have been \n<a href=\"http://wanna-joke.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/what-a-view.jpg\">enjoying vistas</a> like this from the space station since the year 2000.",
