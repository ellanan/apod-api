  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is Comet Maccholz so depleted of carbon-containing chemicals? \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/96P/Machholz\">Comet 96P/Machholz</a>'s \noriginal fame derives from its getting closer to the Sun than any other short period comet -- half as close as \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury\">Mercury</a> -- \nand doing so every five years.\n\nTo better understand this unusual comet, NASA's Sun-monitoring \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory\">SOHO spacecraft</a> tracked the comet during its latest \n<a href=\"ap151102.html\">approach to the Sun</a> in October.\n \nThe <a href=\"https://eitv3.deviantart.com/art/Comet-Macholz-transit-2017-10-27-to-2017-10-29-712667342\">featured image composite</a> shows the tail-enhanced comet swooping past the Sun.\n\nThe Sun's bright surface is hidden from view behind a dark occulter, \nalthough parts of the Sun's extended \n<a href=\"ap170920.html\">corona</a> are visible.\n\nNeighboring stars dot the background.\n\nOne hypothesis holds that these close solar approaches somehow cause \n<a href=\"https://www.space.com/6184-odd-comet-possibly-star-system.html\">Comet Machholz</a> to shed its \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml\">carbon</a>, \nwhile another hypothesis posits that the comet formed with \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AJ....136.2204S\">this composition</a> \nfar away -- possibly even in \n<a href=\"ap171103.html\">another star system</a>.",
