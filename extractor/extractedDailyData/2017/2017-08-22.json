  "title": "A Total Solar Eclipse over Wyoming",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill the sky be clear enough to see the eclipse?\n\nThis question was on the minds of many people attempting to view yesterday's\nsolar eclipse.\n\nThe path of total darkness crossed the mainland of the USA from coast to coast, from Oregon to South Carolina -- but a partial eclipse occurred above all of \nNorth America. \n\nUnfortunately, many locations saw predominantly clouds.\n\nOne location that did not was a bank of Green River Lake, Wyoming. \n\nThere, clouds blocked the Sun intermittantly up to one  minute \nbefore totality.\n\nParting clouds then moved far enough away to allow\nthe center image of the featured composite sequence to be taken.\n\nThis image shows the corona of the Sun extending out past the central dark Moon that blocks our familiar Sun.\n\nThe surrounding images show the partial phases of the solar eclipse\nboth before and after totality.",
