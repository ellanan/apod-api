  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere do hurricanes go? \n\nTo better understand dangerous storms, NASA compiled data from several satellites into a \n<a href=\"https://modelingguru.nasa.gov/community/atmospheric/geos_das\">supercomputer simulation</a> of this past year's hurricane season.\n\nSpecifically, the \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12772\">featured video</a> shows how smoke (white), sea salt (blue), and dust (brown) \n<a href=\"ap120904.html\">tracked</a> \nfrom 2017 August through October across the northern half of Earth's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere\">Western Hemisphere</a>.\n\nThese <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Aerosols.html\">aerosols</a> usefully trace \n<a href=\"http://weatherfaqs.org.uk/node/181\">sometimes invisible</a> winds.\n\nIn the midst of the many \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fi_hsRqO7OQ/hqdefault.jpg\">mesmerizing flows</a>, hurricanes can be seen swirling across the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean\">Atlantic Ocean</a> on the right.\n\nSome of \n<a href=\"ap170826.html\">these</a>  \n<a href=\"ap170910.html\">hurricanes</a> lashed \n<a href=\"https://disasters.nasa.gov/hurricane-maria-2017/suomi-npp-sees-power-outages-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria\">islands</a> and \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=90855\">coastal regions</a> in North America before dissipating in the northern Atlantic.\n\nStudying this year's weather patterns may bolster more accurate \n<a href=\"https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC17/demos/demo34.html\">storm forecasts</a> as soon as next year.",
