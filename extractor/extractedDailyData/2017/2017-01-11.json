  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nMimas is an icy, crater-pocked moon of Saturn a\nmere 400 kilometers (250 miles) in diameter.\n\nIts largest crater Herschel is nearly 140 kilometers wide.\n\nAbout a third the diameter\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4342\">of Mimas\nitself</a>, Herschel crater gives the small moon an ominous appearance,\nespecially for scifi fans of the Death Star battlestation of\nStar Wars fame.\n\nIn fact, only a slightly bigger impact than the one that created such a large\ncrater on a small moon could have destroyed Mimas entirely.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20515\">In this\nCassini image</a> from October 2016, the anti-Saturn hemisphere\nof the synchronously rotating moon is bathed in sunlight,\nits large crater near the right limb.\n\nCasting a long shadow across the crater floor, Herschel's central\nmountain peak is nearly as tall as Mount Everest\n<a href=\"ap160225.html\">on planet Earth</a>.",
