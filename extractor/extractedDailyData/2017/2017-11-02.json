  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDistant galaxies lie beyond a foreground of spiky\nMilky Way stars in this\n<a href=\"http://www.bagil.hu/index.php/fotogaleria\">telescopic\nfield of view</a>.\n\nCentered on yellowish star HD 14771,\nthe scene spans about 1 degree on the sky toward the\nnorthern constellation Andromeda.\n\nAt top right is large spiral galaxy NGC 891, 100 thousand light-years\nacross and seen almost <a href=\"ap131011.html\">exactly edge-on</a>.\n\nAbout 30 million light-years distant, NGC 891 looks a lot like our own\nMilky Way with a flattened, thin, galactic disk.\n\nIts disk and central bulge are cut\n<a href=\"ap110520.html\">along the middle</a> by dark,\nobscuring dust clouds.\n\nScattered toward the lower left are members of\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-007\">galaxy\ncluster</a> Abell 347.\n\nNearly 240 million light-years away,\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy-mall.com/Adventures.In.Deep.Space/\nagc347ch.htm\">Abell 347</a> shows off its own\nlarge galaxies in the sharp image.\n\nThey are similar to NGC 891 in physical size but located almost\n8 times farther away, so Abell 347 galaxies have roughly one eighth the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html\">apparent size</a>\nof NGC 891.",
