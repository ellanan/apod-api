  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs the continent at the end of the Earth slowly melting? \n\nFor millions of years, \n<a href=\"ap991116.html\">Antarctica</a>, \nthe frozen continent at the southern end of planet Earth, \nhas been <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ice/chill.html\">encased in a gigantic sheet</a> of ice.   \n\nRecently, the \n<a href=\"http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace/\">orbiting robotic GRACE satellite</a> \nhas been taking sensitive measurements of the \n<a href=\"ap030723.html\">gravity</a> for the entire Earth, including \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica\">Antarctica</a>.  \n\nRecent <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2006-028\">analysis</a> of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment\">Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment</a> (GRACE) data indicate that the \nAntarctic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Ice_Sheet\">ice sheet</a> \nmight have lost enough mass to cause the worlds' oceans to rise about \n1.2 millimeters, on the average, from between 2002 and 2005.   \n\nAlthough this may not seem like much, the equivalent amount of water is about 150 trillion \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liter\">liter</a>s, \nequivalent to the amount of \n<a href=\"http://asuwlink.uwyo.edu/~mthomas/\">water used by US residents</a> \nin three months.  \n\nUncertainties in the measurement make the mass loss uncertain by about 80 trillion liters.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2006-028\">Pictured above</a> is an \n<a href=\"http://express.howstuffworks.com/wq-iceberg.htm\">iceberg</a> \nthat is a small part of the \n<a href=\"ap050223.html\">Antarctic ice sheet</a>.\n\nThe picture was taken on\nthe Riiser-Larsen ice shelf in December 1995.\n\nFuture research will likely focus on trying to better understand the data, take more data, predict future trends, and understand \n<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/kids/gw.html\">possible effects</a> of these \ntrends on the \n<a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/edu/gwdebate/\">future climate</a> of our entire \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">home planet</a>.",
