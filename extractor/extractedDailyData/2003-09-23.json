  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nToday is the \n<a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/AutumnalEquinox.html\">autumnal equinox</a> -- should \n<a href=\"http://www.mybackyard.com/current/183r1p1.htm\">eggs</a> be able to stand on end?  \n\nThis long-standing \n<a href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_089.html\">myth</a> loses much of its mystique after a demonstration \nthat eggs can be made to stand on end during any day of the year.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/egg_spin.html\">Pictured above</a>, Dr. \n<a href=\"http://epo.sonoma.edu/group/plait.html\">Phil Plait</a> \n(<a href=\"http://epo.sonoma.edu/\">Sonoma St. U.</a>) acting as the \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/info/whois.html\">Bad Astronomer</a> balanced three raw eggs on end in late October 1998.  \n\nLater, more modestly, his wife balanced five more. \n\nThe little-appreciated fact that most eggshells have \nsmall bumps on them makes this seemingly impossible task achievable.  \n\nAlthough, during an \n<a href=\"ap010330.html\">equinox</a>, every place on Earth \nexperiences an \n<a href=\"ap000923.html\">equal</a> length day and night \n(12 hours each), this fact has no practical effect on \n<a href=\"http://www.clarkfoundation.org/astro-utah/vondel/equinoxver.html\">egg stability</a>.",
