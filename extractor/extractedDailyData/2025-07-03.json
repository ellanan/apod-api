  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you know where to look, you can see a thermonuclear explosion from a white dwarf star.\n\nPossibly two. \n\nSuch explosions are known as \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/whats-a-nova-inside-the-chaos-of-erupting-and-exploding-stars/\">novas</a> and the detonations \nare currently faintly visible with the unaided eye in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere\">Earth's southern hemisphere</a> -- but are more easily seen with binoculars.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1300777402055129&amp;set=a.596070423868752\">Pictured</a>, Nova Lupi 2025 (V462 Lupi) was captured \ntoward the southern constellation of the Wolf \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_(constellation)\">Lupus</a>) \nlast week near the central plane of our Milky Way galaxy. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V462_Lupi\">Nova Lupi 2025</a> \nwas originally discovered on June 12 and peaked in brightness about a week later.\n\nSimilarly, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V572_Velorum\">Nova Velorum 2025</a>, \ntoward the southern constellation of the Ship Sails \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(constellation)\">Vela</a>), \nwas discovered on June 25 and peaked a few days later. \n\nA <a href=\"ap240430.html\">nova</a> somewhere in our Galaxy \nbecomes briefly visible to the unaided eye only every year or two, \nso it is quite unusual to have \n<a href=\"https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=30&amp;month=06&amp;year=2025\">two novas visible</a> simultaneously. \n\nMeanwhile, \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fb1321qw5yzr61.jpg\">humanity awaits</a> even a different nova: \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/20393/\">T Coronae Borealis</a>, \nwhich should become visible in northern skies and is expected to become even brighter.",
