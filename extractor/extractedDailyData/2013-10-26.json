  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFound among the rich starfields of the Milky Way toward the\nconstellation Cassiopeia,\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n7789.html\">star\ncluster NGC 7789</a> lies about 8,000 light-years away.\n\nA late 18th century\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/\nCaroline_Herschel_Objects.html\">deep sky discovery</a> of astronomer\n<a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/\nHerschel_Caroline.html\">Caroline Lucretia Herschel</a>,\nthe cluster is also known as Caroline's Rose.\n\nIts suggestive appearance is created by the cluster's nestled\ncomplex of stars and voids.\n\nNow estimated to be 1.6 billion years young, the\ngalactic or open cluster of stars also shows its age.\n\nAll the stars in the cluster were likely born\nat the same time, but the brighter and more massive ones have more\nrapidly exhausted the hydrogen fuel in their\ncores.\n\nThese have evolved from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence\">main sequence</a>\nstars like the Sun into the many red giant stars shown with a \nyellowish cast in this lovely color composite.\n\nUsing measured\n<a href=\"ap010223.html\">color and brightness, astronomers</a>\ncan model the mass and hence the age of\nthe cluster stars just starting to \"turn off\" the main sequence\nand become <a href=\"ap110408.html\">red giants</a>.\n\nOver 50 light-years across,\n<a href=\"http://www.asod.info/?p=6548\">Caroline's Rose</a> spans about\nhalf a degree (the angular size of the moon)\nnear the center of the wide-field telescopic image.",
