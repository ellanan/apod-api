  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those strange blue objects?  Many are images of a <i>single, </i>\n<a href=\"ap950702.html\">unusual, beaded, blue, ring-like \ngalaxy</a> which just happens to line-up behind a giant \n<a href=\"ap970426.html\">cluster of galaxies.</a> \nCluster galaxies here appear yellow and --\ntogether with the <a href=\"ap960419.html\">cluster's dark matter</a> -- \nact as a \n<a href=\"ap951220.html\">gravitational lens</a>.  A \ngravitational lens can create several images of background galaxies,\nanalogous to the many points of light one would see while looking through a\nwine glass at a distant street light. \n<a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v461n2/5782/5782.html\">The \ndistinctive shape of this background galaxy</a> -- which is probably just forming -- \nhas allowed astronomers to deduce that it has separate\nimages at 4, 8, 9 and 10 o'clock, from the center of the cluster. \nPossibly even the blue smudge just left of center is yet another image! \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~library/preprints/pop647.jpg\">This\nspectacular photo</a> from \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">HST</a> was taken in October 1994. The first \n<a href=\"ap950710.html\">cluster lens</a> \nwas found unexpectedly by Roger Lynds \n(<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/\">NOAO</a>) and \n<a href=\"http://bigbang.stanford.edu/group.html\">Vahe Petrosian</a> \n(<a href=\"http://bigbang.stanford.edu/\">Stanford</a>)\nin 1986 while testing a new type of imaging device.  \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/10/A.html\">Lensed arcs around\nthis cluster</a>, CL0024+1654, were first discovered from the ground by \n<a href=\"http://www.ucolick.org/~koo/home.html\">David\nKoo</a> (<a href=\"http://www.ucolick.org/\">UCO Lick</a>) in 1988.",
