  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nM31, the Andromeda Galaxy, is the closest large spiral galaxy to\nour Milky Way.\n\nSome 2.5 million light-years distant it shines in Earth's night sky as a\nsmall, faint, elongated cloud just visible to the unaided eye.\n\nInvisible to the eye though, its enormous halo of hot ionized gas is\nrepresented in purplish hues for\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2020/46/4735-Image\">this digital illustration</a>\nof our neighboring galaxy\n<a href=\"ap200326.html\">above rocky terrain</a>.\n\nMapped by Hubble Space Telescope observations of the\nabsorption of ultraviolet light against\ndistant quasars, the extent and make-up of Andromeda's gaseous halo has been\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2020/news-2020-46\">recently determined by the AMIGA project</a>.\n\nA reservoir of material for future star formation,\nAndromeda's halo of diffuse\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07818\">plasma was measured</a>\nto extend around 1.3 million light-years or more from the galaxy.\n\nThat's about half way to the Milky Way,\nlikely putting it in contact with the diffuse gaseous halo of our own\ngalaxy.",
