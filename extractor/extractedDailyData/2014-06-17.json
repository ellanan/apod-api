  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat caused this outburst of V838 Mon?  \n\nFor reasons unknown, star <a href=\"ap030327.html\">V838 Mon</a>\nsuddenly became one of the brightest stars in the entire \n<a href=\"ap990224.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nThen, just a few months later, it faded.  \n\nA stellar flash like this has never been seen before -- \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernovas</a> \nand <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/novae/novae.html\">novas</a> expel a tremendous amount of matter out into space.  \n\nAlthough the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/10/text\">V838 Mon</a> flash appeared to expel some material into space, what is seen in the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic0617a/\">above eight-frame movie</a>, interpolated for smoothness, is actually an outwardly moving \n<a href=\"ap971023.html\">light echo</a> of the flash.  \n\nThe actual time-span of the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93L0IEbUJsk\">above movie</a> \nis from 2002, when the flash was first recorded, to 2006. \n\nIn a <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Natur.422..405B\">light echo</a>, light from the flash is \nreflected by successively more distant ellipsoids in the complex array of ambient \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">interstellar dust</a> \nthat already surrounded the star.  \n\nCurrently, the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...451..223T\">leading model</a> for \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/tours/tour-v838/\">V838</a>'s \noutburst was the orbital decay and subsequent merging of two relatively normal stars.\n\n<a href=\"ap021003.html\">V838 Mon</a> lies about 20,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away toward the \n<a href=\"ap030401.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/mon.html\">Monoceros</a>, while the largest \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/06/12/v838_mon_video_of_a_stellar_outburst.html\">light echo</a> above spans about \nsix light years in diameter.",
