  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat lights up this castle of star formation?  The familiar \n<a href=\"ap970718.html\">Eagle Nebula</a> glows much like a \n<a href=\"http://sdphln.ucsd.edu/~kriesel/neon.html\">neon sign</a>, \nbut in many colors at once.  The \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/hotimage/m16.html\">above \nphotograph</a> is a composite of three of these glowing gas colors.  \nIn particular the glowing red \n<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/~chem/web-elements/genr/S.html\">Sulfur</a> \ngas of the nebula nicely outlines some of the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/44.html\">denser \nstar forming knots</a>.  Energetic light from young massive stars \ncauses the gas to glow and effectively boils away part of the \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a> and gas from its birth pillar.  \nMany of these stars will \n<a href=\"lib/supernova.html\">explode</a> after several million years, \nreturning most of their elements back to the nebula which formed them.  \nThis process is forming an \n<a href=\"ap960903.html\">open cluster</a> of stars known as \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m016.html\">M16</a>.",
