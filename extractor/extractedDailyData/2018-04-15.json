  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that rising from the clouds?  \n\nThe space shuttle.\n\nSometimes, if you look out the window of an airplane at just the right time and place, you see something unusual -- in this case a space shuttle launching to orbit.  \n\n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-134/html/sts134-s-061.html\">featured image</a> of <a href=\"ap110518.html\">Endeavour's final launch</a> in 2011 May was captured from a NASA shuttle training aircraft. \n\nTaken well above the clouds, the image can be matched with similar images of the same shuttle plume taken \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-134/html/sts134-s-013.html\">below the clouds</a>.  \n\nHot glowing gasses expelled by the engines are visible near the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X47raRdRSBA\">rising shuttle</a>, as well as a long smoke plume.  \n\nA <a href=\"ap070603.html\">shadow of the plume</a> appears on the cloud deck, indicating the direction of the Sun.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html\">US Space Shuttle program</a> concluded in 2011, and \n<a href=\"ap100907.html\">Endeavour</a> can now be \n<a href=\"ap121022.html\">visited</a> at the \n<a href=\"http://californiasciencecenter.org/exhibits/air-space/space-shuttle-endeavour\">California Science Center</a>.  \n\nPlanned for tomorrow, however, is a different launch -- that of the \n<a href=\"https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> (TESS) aboard a SpaceX \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_Full_Thrust\">Falcon 9</a> rocket.",
