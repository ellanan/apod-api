  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's the matter with this cluster of galaxies?\n\nTo find out what forms matter takes in the\n<a href=\"ap040627.html\">Abell 1689 cluster</a> requires not only deep images from telescopes like the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, but detailed \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewforum.php?f=35\">computer modeling</a> as well.\n\nTo start, almost every fuzzy yellow patch in the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/26/image/a/\">above image</a> is an entire galaxy.\n\nA close inspection, however, shows that many background galaxies are strangely magnified and distorted into\n<a href=\"ap090921.html\">long curving arcs</a> by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens\">gravitational lens</a> deflections of the cluster.  \n\nComputer analyses of the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-My9CChyBw\">placement</a> and smoothness of these arcs indicate that in addition to the matter in the galaxies you can see, the cluster must also contain a significant amount of\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter/index5.html\">dark matter</a> such as the model digitally superposed in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple\">purple</a>.  \n\nNow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_1689\">Abell 1689</a> remains enigmatic because the arcs are so numerous and diverse that no single \n<a href=\"http://astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/darkmatter/dm.html\">dark matter</a> model has emerged that can \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1008.2758L\">explain them all</a> and still remain consistent with dark matter models needed to constrain their motion.  \n\nStill, the detailed information available from \n<a href=\"clusters_of_galaxies.html\">clusters of galaxies</a> like Abell 1689 gives hope that one day full solutions will be found that will not only fully reveal the \n<a href=\"ap080917.html\">dark matter in clusters</a>, \nbut also reveal the amounts of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a> \nin the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N\">universe</a> \nneeded to lie along the line of sight to the \n<a href=\"ap040217.html\">distant arcs</a>.",
