  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does this comet have so many tails?\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_(ATLAS)\">C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)</a> has developed several \nlong and intricate tails visible from \nEarth's southern hemisphere over the past two weeks.\n\nMany observers reported seeing the \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fgfkvsovdq4l21.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dd24871a13ae2249f7681f845e63e636098a85c84\">impressive</a> comet without any \n<a href=\"ap250124.html\">optical aid</a> \nabove the western horizon just after sunset.\n\nAt least six different tails appear in the \nfeatured image captured five days ago from the dark skies above \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/k_LwlwJWZN0\">Paranal Observatory</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>. \n\nOne possible cause for the multiple tails is dust and gas being \n<a href=\"ap151118.html\">expelled</a> from the comet's \n<a href=\"ap960414.html\">rotating nucleus</a>.\n\nThe outward push of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>'s complex \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/resource/solar-wind-across-our-solar-system-infographic/\">solar wind</a> may also play a role.\n\nThe huge iceberg-like nucleus of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/facts/\">Comet</a> \n<a href=\"https://atlas.fallingstar.com/\">ATLAS</a> appears to have \n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/uncategorized/comet-atlas-caught-in-the-act-of-disintegration/\">broken up</a> near its closest approach to the Sun two weeks ago. \n\nUnfortunately, \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info\">Comet ATLAS</a> \nand its tails are expected to fade significantly over the coming weeks.",
