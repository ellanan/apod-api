  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOne of the all-time historic skyscapes occured in July 1054, when the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1054\">Crab Supernova</a>\nblazed into the dawn sky.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.lehigh.edu/~dwp0/Assets/images/astroorigins.pdf\">Chinese court astrologers</a>\nfirst saw the\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003LNP...598....7G/abstract\">Guest Star</a>\non the morning of 4 July 1054\nnext to the  star\n<a href=\"https://www.star-facts.com/tianguan-zeta-tauri/\">Tianguan</a>\n(now cataloged as\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/zetatau.html\">Zeta Tauri</a>).\n\nThe\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/\">supernova</a>\npeaked in late July 1054 a bit brighter than Venus,\nand was visible in the daytime for 23 days.\n\nThe Guest Star was so bright that every culture around the world\ninevitably discovered the supernova independently, although only nine\nreports survive, including those from China,\n<a href=\"https://www.kyohaku.go.jp/eng/learn/home/dictio/shoseki/sadaie/\">Japan</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/18/archives/old-text-is-linked-to-1054-supernova-scientific-journal-tells-of.html\">Constantinople</a>.\n\nThis iPhone picture is from\n<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/signal-hill-petroglyphs.htm\">Signal Hill</a>\nnear Tucson on the morning of 26 July 2025,\nfaithfully re-creates the year 1054 Dawn of the Crab,\nshowing the sky as seen by\n<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hohokam-culture\">Hohokam</a> peoples.\n\nThe planet Venus, as a stand-in for the\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003LNP...598..195P/abstract\">supernova</a>,\nis close to the position of what is now the\n<a href=\"ap011227.html\">Crab Nebula</a> supernova remnant.\n\nStep outside on a\nsummer dawn with bright Venus, and ask yourself \"What would you have\nthought in ancient times when suddenly seeing the Dawn of the Crab?\"",
