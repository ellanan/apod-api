  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA long time ago in a galaxy 50 million light-years away,\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/type-ia-supernova/\">a star exploded</a>.\n\nLight from that\n<a href=\"https://goto-observatory.org/bright-supernova-2025rbs-discovered-by-goto/\">supernova was first detected</a>\nby telescopes on planet Earth on July 14th though, and the\nextragalactic transient is now known to astronomers as\n<a href=\"https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2025rbs\">supernova 2025rbs</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html\">Presently the brightest</a>\nsupernova in planet Earth's sky, 2025rbs\nis a Type Ia supernova,\nlikely caused by the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf star\nthat accreted material from a companion in a binary star system. \n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/roman-space-telescope/type-ia-supernovae/\">Type Ia supernovae are</a>\nused as standard candles to establish the distance scale of the universe.\n\nThe host galaxy of 2025rbs is NGC 7331.\n\nItself a bright spiral galaxy in the northern constellation Pegasus,\n<a href=\"ap220922.html\">NGC 7331 is</a> often\ntouted as an analog to our own Milky Way.",
