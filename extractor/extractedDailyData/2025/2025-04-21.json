  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs this one galaxy or two?\n\nAlthough it looks like one, the answer is two.\n\nOne path to this happening is when a small \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/galaxy/en/\">galaxy</a> \ncollides with a larger galaxy and \n<a href=\"ap201018.html\">ends up in the center</a>.\n\nBut in the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/03/Webb_spies_a_spiral_through_a_cosmic_lens\">featured image</a>, something <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2jqsdk/the_omg_cat/#lightbox\">more rare</a> is going on.\n\nHere, the central light-colored \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/types/#elliptical-galaxies\">elliptical galaxy</a> is much closer than the blue and red-colored \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/types/#spiral-galaxies\">spiral galaxy</a> that surrounds it.\n\nThis can happen when near and far galaxies are <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stsci-h-p2005b-f-4096x2160-1-jpg.webp\">exactly aligned</a>, causing the gravity of the \nnear galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-behind-the-discoveries/hubble-gravitational-lenses/\">gravitational lensing</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/potm2503a/\">featured galaxy double</a> was taken by the \n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/home\">Webb Space Telescope</a> \nand shows a complete \n<a href=\"ap160420.html\">Einstein ring</a>, with great detail visible for both galaxies.\n\n\nGalaxy \n<a href=\"ap220705.html\">lenses like this</a> can reveal \nnew information about the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/shining-a-light-on-dark-matter/\">mass distribution</a> of the foreground lens and the \n<a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/newly-discovered-gravitational-lenses-could-reveal-ancient-galaxies-and-nature-dark-matter\">light distribution</a> of the background source.",
