  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does this galaxy look like a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddlehead\">curly vegetable</a>? \n\nThe <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-spots-a-curious-spiral/\">Fiddlehead spiral galaxy</a> \nlikely gets its distorted spiral appearance from a \n<a href=\"ap201203.html\">gravitational interaction</a> with its close-by elliptical companion \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_770#/media/File:NGC_0770_SDSS.jpg\">NGC 770</a>, seen just below. \n\nCataloged as NGC 772 and Arp 78, \nthe Fiddlehead spans over 200,000 light years, \nis a nearby 100 million light years beyond \nthe stars of our Milky Way galaxy, and is visible toward the \n<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Aries\">constellation of the Ram</a> (Aries). \n\nBut in the \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/gcz15v/0/\">featured image</a>, \nthe Fiddlehead appears to have another companion -- \none with a long and fuzzy tail: \n<a href=\"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=43P%2FWolf-Harrington\">Comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington</a>. \n\nThough the comet appears to be aimed straight at the massive galaxy, it is actually much closer to us, residing only \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light minutes</a> away -- well within our Solar System. \n\nThe comet will never reach the distant spiral galaxy, \nnor is it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/cztlvz/precious_gang_of_two_real_cats_and_a_fake_one/#lightbox\">physically related</a> to it. \n\nBy a fortunate trick of perspective, though, these two cosmic wonders briefly share the same frame taken late last year from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bnQzW7TEtPQ\">Calern</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>.",
