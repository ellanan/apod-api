  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow were these unusual Martian spherules created? \n\nThousands of \n<a href=\"ap040210.html\">unusual gray spherules</a> made of \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/26.shtml\">iron</a> and rock and dubbed \n<a href=\"https://www.wildblueberries.net/bluehistory.html\">blueberries</a> \nwere found embedded in and \n<a href=\"ap040204.html\">surrounding rocks</a> near the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/location-map/\">landing site</a> of the robot \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-exploration-rovers-spirit-and-opportunity/\">Opportunity rover</a> on \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/\">Mars</a> in 2004. \n\nTo help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a \nsurface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was \n<a href=\"ap040216.html\">rich in the Martian orbs</a>. \n\nThe Berry Bowl is \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05634\">pictured here</a>, imaged during rover's 48th \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_sol\">Martian day</a>. \n\nThe average size of a Martian blueberry rock \nis only about 4 millimeters across. \n\nBy \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Icar..289..144W/abstract\">analyzing</a> a circular patch in the rock surface \nto the left of the densest patch of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_spherules\">spherules</a>, \nOpportunity obtained data showing that the \nunderlying rock has a much different composition than the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite\">hematite</a> rich \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/martian-blueberries-2/\">blueberries</a>. \n\nThis information contributes to the \ngrowing consensus that these small, strange, \ngray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of \n<a href=\"ap040303.html\">dirty water</a>.",
