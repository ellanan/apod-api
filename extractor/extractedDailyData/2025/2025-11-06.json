  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n0253.html\">Shiny NGC 253</a>\nis one of the brightest spiral galaxies visible, and also one of\nthe dustiest.  \n\nSome call it the Silver Coin Galaxy for its appearance in small\ntelescopes, or just the Sculptor Galaxy for its location within\nthe boundaries of the southern constellation Sculptor. \n\nDiscovered in 1783 by mathematician and astronomer\n<a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/caroline-herschel-first-paid-female-astronomer\">Caroline Herschel</a>,\nthe dusty island universe lies a mere 10 million light-years away.\n\nAbout 70 thousand light-years across, NGC 253 is the largest member of\nthe <a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/sclgr.html\">Sculptor Group of Galaxies</a>,\nthe nearest to our own\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/more/local.html\">Local Group of Galaxies</a>.  \n\nIn addition to its spiral dust lanes, tendrils of dust seem to be\n<a href=\"ap110519.html\">rising from its galactic disk</a>\nlaced with young star clusters and star forming regions in\n<a href=\"https://www.adamblockphotos.com/ngc-253.html\">this colorful galaxy portrait</a>.\n\nThe high dust content accompanies frantic star formation,\n<a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509430\">earning</a>\nNGC 253 the designation of a\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1995/10/271-Image.html\">starburst galaxy</a>.\n\nNGC 253 is also known to be a strong source of high-energy\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2001/0012/index.html\">x-rays</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasa-missions-unmask-magnetar-eruptions-in-nearby-galaxies/\">gamma rays</a>,\nlikely due to black holes near the galaxy's center.",
