  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf one black hole looks strange, what about two?\n\nLight rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting \n<a href=\"ap100529.html\">supermassive black holes</a> make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/universe/new-nasa-visualization-probes-the-light-bending-dance-of-binary-black-holes/\">this detailed computer visualization</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap200825.html\">simulated accretion disk</a>s \nhave been given different <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/1247cvr/im_a_dog_groomer_and_my_sister_left_me_with_her/#lightbox\">false color</a> schemes, \nred for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, \nand blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/\">black hole</a>. \n\nFor these masses, though, both \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk\">accretion disk</a>s would \n<a href=\"ap190411.html\">actually emit</a> most of their light in the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/\">ultraviolet</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14132/\">video</a> \nallows us to see \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N/abstract\">both sides</a> of each black hole at the same time. \n\nRed and blue light originating from both \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black holes can be seen</a> in the innermost ring of light, called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere\">photon sphere</a>, near their event horizons. \n\nIn the past decade, \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/\">gravitational wave</a>s from black hole collisions have actually \n<a href=\"ap201104.html\">been detected</a>, although the \n<a href=\"ap210411.html\">coalescence</a> of \nsupermassive black holes remains undiscovered.",
