  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMany wonders are visible when flying over the Earth at night. \n\nSuch visual spectacles occur every day for astronauts in low Earth orbit, but the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FG0fTKAqZ5g\">featured video</a> \ncaptured several from the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) in 2011 and set them to rousing music. \n\nPassing below are \n<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/why-are-clouds-white-5583751\">white clouds</a>, \n<a href=\"ap220213.html\">orange city lights</a>, \n<a href=\"lightningmaps.org/\">lightning flashes</a> in \n<a href=\"ap220116.html\">thunderstorm</a>s, and dark \n<a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanblue.html\">blue seas</a>. \n\nOn the horizon is the \n<a href=\"ap100623.html\">golden haze</a> of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's thin atmosphere</a>, \nfrequently decorated by dancing auroras as the video progresses. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap200105.html\">green parts</a> of auroras typically remain below the space station, but the station flies \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/auroras/\">right through</a> \nthe red and purple auroral peaks. \n\nSolar panels of the ISS are seen around the frame edges. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fscared-dog-meme-v0-j8fm8pq6scnf1.jpeg%3Fformat%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De244c99791d1a7eeb606c569d8444981b3541d52\">ominous</a> wave of approaching brightness at the end of each sequence is just the \n<a href=\"ap130331.html\">dawn</a> of the sunlit half of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">Earth</a>, \na dawn that occurs every 90 minutes.",
