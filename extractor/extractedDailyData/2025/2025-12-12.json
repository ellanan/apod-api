  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://aurora-nights.co.uk/aurora-academy/what-are-the-northern-lights/sami-view-of-the-northern-lights/\">In a Finnish myth</a>,\nwhen an arctic fox runs so fast that its bushy tail brushes the mountains,\nflaming sparks are cast into the heavens creating the northern lights.\n\nIn fact the Finnish word \"revontulet\", a name for\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/auroras/\">the aurora borealis or northern lights</a>,\ncan be translated as fire fox.\n\nSo that evocative myth took on a special significance for the\nphotographer of this northern night skyscape from\nFinnish Lapland near Kilpisjarvi Lake.\n\nThe snowy scene is illuminated by moonlight.\n\nSaana, an iconic fell or mountain of Lapland,\nrises at the right in the background.\n\nBut as the <a href=\"ap231117.html\">beautiful nothern lights</a>\ndanced overhead,\nthe wild fire fox in the foreground enthusiastically ran around\nthe photographer and his equipment,\nmaking it difficult to capture in this lucky single shot.",
