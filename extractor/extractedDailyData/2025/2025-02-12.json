  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat can a space rock tell us about life on Earth? \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/\">OSIRIS-REx spacecraft</a> \n<a href=\"ap201012.html\">made a careful approach</a> \nto the near-Earth asteroid \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/101955-bennu/\">101955 Bennu</a> in \n<a href=\"ap201022.html\">October of 2020</a> to collect surface samples. \n\nIn September 2023, the robotic spaceship \n<a href=\"ap230929.html\">returned these samples to Earth</a>. \n\nA recent \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6\">analysis</a> has \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9\">shown</a>, surprisingly, \nthat the samples contained 14 out of the 20 known \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid\">amino acid</a>s \nthat are the essential building blocks of life. \n\nThe presence of the amino acids re-introduces a big question: \nCould life have originated in space? \n\nHowever, the protein building blocks themselves held another surprise -- \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-asteroid-bennu-sample-reveals-mix-of-lifes-ingredients/\">they contained</a> an even mixture of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality\">left-handed and right-handed</a> amino acids -- \nin contrast to our Earth which only has left-handed ones. \n\nThis raises another big question: \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/how-life-turned-left/\">Why</a> does life on Earth have only left-handed amino acids? \n\nResearch on this is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/fd55vk/my_kitten_is_helping_me_work_from_home_i_had_to/#lightbox\">sure to continue</a>.",
