  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy was this collision so strange?\n\nIn 2022, to develop Earth-saving technology, NASA deliberately \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/darts-small-satellite-companion-takes-flight-ahead-of-impact/\">crashed the DART spacecraft</a> into the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/\">asteroid</a> moonlet Dimorphos.\n\nThe hope was that this collision would alter the trajectory of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimorphos\">Dimorphos</a> around its parent asteroid \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/didymos/\">Didymos</a> and so demonstrate that similar collisions could, \nin theory, save the Earth from being hit by (other) hazardous asteroids. \n\nBut <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/addd1a\">analyses of new results</a> show that the effects of the collision are \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iijreaGHS3c\">different than expected</a> -- and we are trying to understand \n<a href=\"https://www.dutch.com/cdn/shop/articles/shutterstock_1073296643_360x.jpg\">why</a>. \n\nFeatured here is the time lapse video taken by the ejected \n<a href=\"https://www.asi.it/en/planets-stars-universe/solar-system-and-beyond/liciacube/\">LICIACube</a> camera \n<a href=\"https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2021-110C\">LUKE</a> showing about 250 seconds of the \n<a href=\"ap221005.html\">expanding debris field</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimorphos\">Dimorphos</a> after the collision, \nwith un-impacted Didymos passing in the foreground. \n\nIn 2026, Europe's \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera\">Hera</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera_(space_mission)\">mission</a> will reach the asteroids and release \nthree spacecraft to better study the matter.",
