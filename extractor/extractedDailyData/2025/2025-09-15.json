  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan our Sun become dangerous?\n\nYes, sometimes.\n\nEvery few years our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> \nejects a scary-large \n<a href=\"ap180902.html\">bubble</a> of hot gas into the \n<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>. \n\nEvery hundred years or so, when the timing, location, and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/\">magnetic field</a> \nconnections are just right, such a \nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME) will hit the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">Earth</a>.\n\nWhen this happens, the \n<a href=\"ap220809.html\">Earth</a> not only experiences dramatic auroras, \nbut its magnetic field gets quickly pushed back and <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/68/39/3f/68393f3ed2ce3ab1aa221497496fb290.jpg\">compressed</a>, which causes electric grids to surge.\n\nSome of these surges could be dangerous, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/may-solar-storm-largest-mass-migration-satellites\">affecting satellites</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/images/u33/finalBoulderPresentation042611%20%281%29.pdf\">knocking out power grids</a> -- \nwhich can take months to fix. \n\nJust such a storm -- called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event\">Carrington Event</a> -- occurred in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1859#Events\">1859</a> and caused \n<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/a-perfect-solar-superstorm-the-1859-carrington-event\">telegraph wires to spark</a>.\n\nA similar <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/st5/SCIENCE/cme.html\">CME</a> passed near the Earth in 2012, and the \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4189/\">featured animated video</a> shows a computer model \nof what might have happened if it had been a direct hit. \n\nIn this model, the Earth's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetopause\">magnetopause</a> becomes so compressed that it went inside the orbit of \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/first-geosynchronous-satellite/\">geosynchronous communication satellite</a>s.",
