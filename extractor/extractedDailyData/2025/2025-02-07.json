  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad9f5c\">The giant galaxy</a>\ncataloged as LEDA 1313424 is about two and a half times\nthe size of our own Milky Way.\n\nIts remarkable appearance in this\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2025/news-2025-006\">recently released Hubble</a>\nSpace Telescope image strongly suggests its\nnickname \"The Bullseye Galaxy\".\n\nKnown as a collisional ring galaxy it has\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2025/006/01JH3M8FV7QTE0NTS9YEP6722W\">nine rings</a>\nconfirmed by telescopic observations,\n<a href=\"ap220824.html\">rippling</a>\nfrom its center like waves from a pebble dropped into a pond.\n\nOf course, the pebble dropped into the Bullseye galaxy was a galaxy\nitself.\n\nTelescopic observations identify the blue dwarf galaxy at center-left\nas the likely collider, passing through the giant galaxy's\ncenter and forming concentric rings in the wake of their\ngravitational interaction.\n\nThe Bullseye Galaxy lies some 567 million light-years away toward the\nconstellation Pisces.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2025/006/01JJADPV8HK2BGG1T12HDSVKT5\">At that distance</a>,\nthis stunning Hubble image would span about 530,000\nlight-years.",
