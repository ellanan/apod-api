  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOn Saturn, the rings tell you the season. \n\nOn <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">Earth</a>, today marks an equinox, the time when the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/equator_.png\">Earth's equator</a> tilts directly toward the Sun. \n\nSince \n<a href=\"ap180424.html\">Saturn's grand rings</a> \norbit along the planet's equator, \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/saturn-rings/en/\">these rings</a> appear most prominent -- \nfrom the direction of the Sun -- when the spin axis of \nSaturn points toward the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>. \n\nConversely, when \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/\">Saturn</a>'s \nspin axis points to the side, an equinox occurs, \nand the edge-on rings are hard to see from not only the Sun -- but \n<a href=\"ap220206.html\">Earth</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOuLq6ADsV4/\">featured montage</a>, images of Saturn between the years of \n<a href=\"ap250429.html\">2020 and 2025</a> \nhave been superposed to show the giant planet passing, \nwith this year's equinox, from summer in the north to summer in the south. \n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/saturn-at-opposition-closest-brightest-best/\">Yesterday</a>, Saturn was coincidently about \n<a href=\"https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3079021/720x960/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg\">as close as it gets</a> to planet Earth, \nand so this month the \n<a href=\"ap200419.html\">ringed giant's orb</a> is relatively bright and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/whats-up-september-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/\">visible throughout</a> the night.",
