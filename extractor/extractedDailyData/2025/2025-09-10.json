  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is one of the largest nebulas on the sky -- why isn't it better known?\n\nRoughly the same angular size as the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-31/\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, the Great Lacerta Nebula can be found toward the \n<a href=\"https://astro4edu.org/resources/diagram/YQ69V022qi60/\">constellation of the Lizard (Lacerta)</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula\">emission nebula</a> is difficult to see with \nwide-field binoculars because \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_distant_astronomical_objects\">it is so faint</a>, but also usually \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4vi9kq/find_a_cat/\">difficult to see</a> with a \nlarge telescope because it is so great in angle -- spanning about three \n<a href=\"https://www.geogebra.org/m/atq6mr3a\">degrees</a>.\n\nThe depth, breadth, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/03_behaviors/\">waves</a>, and beauty of the nebula -- cataloged as \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/6egtl5/\">Sharpless 126 (Sh2-126)</a> -- \ncan best be seen and appreciated with a \n<a href=\"ap200329.html\">long duration camera exposure</a>.\n\nThe featured image is one such combined exposure -- in this case \ntaken over three nights in August through dark skies in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/TWA_2KnNjb4\">Moses Lake</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)\">Washington</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap161024.html\">hydrogen</a> gas in the Great Lacerta Nebula \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha\">glows red</a> because it is excited by light from the bright star \n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6KLAtMAMknWsqpvmMHna0C\">10 Lacertae</a>, one of the bright blue stars \njust to the left of the red-glowing nebula's center. \n\nMost of the stars and nebula are about 1,200 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> distant.",
