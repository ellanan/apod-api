  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan you identify this celestial object? \n\nLikely not — because this is a \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/280z5s/\">discovery image</a>.  \n\nMassive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, \nafter a few million years, end their lives in powerful \n<a href=\"ap250508.html\">supernova explosions</a>.\n\nThese \n<a href=\"ap250117.html\">remnants</a> cool relatively quickly and fade, \nmaking them difficult to detect. \n\nTo uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, \na dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through \n<a href=\"https://archive.eso.org/dss/dss\">sky surveys</a> \nfor possible supernova remnant candidates. \n\nThe result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 — \nnamed Scylla by its discoverers—glowing faintly \nin the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: \n<a hef=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation)\">Cepheus</a>. \n\nEmission from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha\">hydrogen</a> atoms in the remnant is shown in red, \nand faint \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_ionized_oxygen\">emission from oxygen</a> is shown in hues of blue. \n\nSurprisingly, another discovery lurked to \nthe upper right: a faint, previously unknown \n<a href=\"https://planetarynebulae.net/EN/\">planetary nebula</a> candidate.\n\nIn keeping with mythological tradition, \nit was named Charybdis (Sai 2) — a nod to the ancient Greek expression \n\"caught <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Scylla_and_Charybdis\">between Scylla and Charybdis</a>\" from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey\">Homer’s Odyssey</a>.",
