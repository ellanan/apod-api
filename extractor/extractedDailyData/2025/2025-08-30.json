  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap080411.html\">A young crescent moon can be hard to see</a>.\n\nThat's because\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5415/\">when the Moon shows</a>\nits crescent phase (young or old)\nit can never be far from the Sun in\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/\">planet Earth's sky</a>.\n\nBut even though the sky is still bright,\na slender sunlit lunar crescent is clearly visible in this\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marprol/p/DNyMcT_0JQb/\">early evening skyscape</a>.\n\nThe telephoto snapshot was captured on August 24, with the Moon very near\nthe western horizon at sunset.\n\nSeen in a narrow crescent phase about 1.5 days old,\nthe visible sunlit portion is a mere two percent of the surface of\nthe Moon's familiar nearside.\n\nAt the\n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/ESA_Ground_Stations/Maspalomas_station\">Canary Islands Space Centre</a>,\na steerable radio dish for\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apollo_11_launch_day_communication_relayed_through_Canary_Station.ogg\">communication with spacecraft</a>\nis tilted in the direction of the two percent Moon.\n\nThe sunset sky's pastel pinkish coloring is partly due to\nfine sand and dust from the\n<a href=\"ap021112.html\">Sahara Desert</a> blown by\nthe prevailing winds.",
