  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are these little red dots (LRDs)?\n\nNobody knows.\n\nDiscovered only last year, hundreds of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_dot_(astronomical_object)\">LRDs</a> have now been found by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/early-universe/\">early universe</a>.\n\nAlthough extremely faint, \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jwsts-little-red-dots-offer-astronomers-the-universes-weirdest-puzzle/\">LRDs</a> are now frequently identified in \ndeep observations made for other purposes.\n\nA wide-ranging debate is raging about what \n<a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/science/little-red-dots-are-still-a-big-mystery/\">LRDs</a> may be and what importance they may have. \n\nPossible origin hypotheses include \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...976...96P/abstract\">accreting supermassive black holes</a> inside clouds of gas and dust, \nbursts of \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973L...2G/abstract\">star formation in young dust-reddened galaxies</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251108578F/abstract\">dark matter powered gas clouds</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/asset/webb/little-red-dots-nircam-image/\">highlighted images</a> show six nearly featureless LRDs \nlisted under the JWST program that found them, and z, \na distance indicator called \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">cosmological redshift</a>. \n\nAdditionally, \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250710659L/abstract\">searches are underway</a> in our nearby universe to try to find whatever previous LRDs might have \n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/002/232/bullet_cat.jpg\">become today</a>.",
