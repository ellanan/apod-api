  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was a new year, and the sky was doubly red. \n\nThe new year meant that the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">Earth</a> \nhad returned to its usual place in its orbit on January 1, \na place a few days before its \n<a href=\"ap250104.html\">closest approach</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>. \n\nThe first of the two red skyglows, on the left, was a <a href=\"https://img.apmcdn.org/7a6d073179a68e50dbf9833adb72225a76554a51/uncropped/0011cd-20241011-nws-aurora-colors-webp1000.webp\">red aurora</a>, \ncomplete with <a href=\"ap061218.html\">vertical rays</a>, caused by a \n<a href=\"ap240818.html\">blast</a> from the Sun \npushing charged particles into \nEarth's atmosphere.  \n\nThe second red glow, most prominent on the far right, \nwas possibly a \n<a href=\"https://eos.org/research-spotlights/from-sar-arc-to-steve-an-atmospheric-evolution\">SAR arc</a> caused by a river of charged \nparticles flowing across \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nAlthough both appear red, the \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-do-my-cats-from-the-same-litter-look-so-different-v0-gp1xxwpi7p9c1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D320%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D8de4979921dc03f68f8f5f58e849277569ff450e\">slight color difference</a> is likely due to the aurora being emitted by both oxygen and nitrogen, whereas the higher \n<a href=\"ap231111.html\">SAR arc</a> was possibly emitted \nmore purely by atmospheric oxygen.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVPPQENcXD\">featured image</a> was taken on January 1 from near \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HktA997YN0Y\">Pieve di Cadore</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>.",
