  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTonight, if you can see the stars of the \n<a href=\"ap130421.html\">Big Dipper</a>, \nthen you can find comet Lemmon in your evening sky. \n\nAfter sunset, \n<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-see-comet-lemmon-this-october/\">look for the faint but extended comet</a> \nabove your northwestern horizon -- \nbut below the handle of the famous celestial kitchen utensil of the north.\n\nIt might be easier to see this visitor to the inner \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/\">Solar System</a> through your camera phone, \nwhich is better at picking up faint objects. \n\nEither way, look for a fuzzy \n<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/why-do-some-comets-glow-green\">green</a> 'star' with a tail, though probably \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fstj7k47yo8e51.jpg\">not so long</a> a tail as in \n<a href=\"https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=25820\">this impressive snapshot</a> taken over Seč Lake in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic\">Czech Republic</a> two nights ago.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.791387673589812&amp;type=3\">Recent photographs</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2025_A6_(Lemmon)\">C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)</a> often show a detailed and \n<a href=\"ap251006.html\">changing ion tail</a> \nwhich extends farther than the eye can follow. \n\nThis \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/c2025a6-info\">Sun-orbiting comet</a> \nis now near its closest approach to \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a>  \nand will pass its closest to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> in early November.",
