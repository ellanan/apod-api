  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFrom a garden on planet Earth, 38 hours of exposure\nwith a camera and small telescope produced\n<a href=\"https://app.astrobin.com/u/Daniel_Yang_K.?i=ldzdz7#gallery\">this cosmic photo</a>\nof the M81 galaxy group.\n\nIn fact, the group's dominant galaxy M81 is near the\ncenter of the frame sporting grand spiral arms and\na bright yellow core.\n\nAlso known as Bode's galaxy, M81 itself spans some 100,000\nlight-years.\n\nNear the top is cigar-shaped \n<a href=\"ap190723.html\">irregular galaxy M82</a>.  \n\nThe pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years.\n\n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-11-astronomers-stellar-halo.html\">Gravity\nfrom each galaxy</a> has profoundly affected the other during\na series of cosmic close encounters.  \n\nTheir last go-round lasted about 100 million years and\nlikely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in massive\nstar forming regions arrayed along\n<a href=\"ap250327.html\">M81</a>'s spiral arms.  \n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2001/news-2001-08.html\">M82</a> was left  with violent star forming regions too, and \ncolliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/m82/\">glows in X-rays</a>.  \n\nIn the next few billion years, their\ncontinuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/collision-scenario-for-milky-way-and-andromeda-galaxy-encounter/\">single galaxy will remain</a>.\n\nAnother group member, NGC 3077 is below and left of the\nlarge spiral M81.\n\nFar far away, about 12 million light-years distant\nthe M81 group galaxies are seen\ntoward the northern constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear).\n\nBut in the closer foreground\nthe wide-field image is filled with integrated flux nebulae\nwhose faint, <a href=\"ap160428.html\">dusty interstellar clouds</a>\nreflect starlight above the plane of our own Milky Way galaxy.",
