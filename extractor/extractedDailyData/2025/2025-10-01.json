  "title": "NGC 6960: The Witch's Broom Nebula",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTen thousand years ago, before the dawn of recorded human history, \na new light would suddenly have appeared in the \nnight sky and faded after a few weeks.  \n\nToday we know this light was from a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">supernova,\nor exploding star</a>,\nand record the expanding debris cloud as the \n<a href=\"ap250602.html\">Veil Nebula</a>, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernova_remnants\">supernova remnant</a>.  \n\nThis sharp telescopic view is centered on a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cygnus_Loop_Labeled.png\">western\nsegment</a> of the \nVeil Nebula cataloged as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalog\">NGC</a> 6960 but less formally known as the Witch's Broom Nebula.  \n\nBlasted out in the cataclysmic explosion, an \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/10-things-going-interstellar/\" {=\"\">interstellar</a> shock wave plows\nthrough space sweeping up and exciting interstellar material.\n\nImaged with narrow band filters, the \n<a href=\"ap170919.html\">glowing filaments</a> are\nlike long ripples in a sheet seen almost edge on,\nremarkably well separated into atomic hydrogen (red)\nand oxygen (blue-green) gas.\n\nThe complete supernova remnant lies about 1400\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-years</a> \naway towards the\n<a href=\"ap101119.html\">constellation Cygnus</a>.\n\nThis Witch's <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3tZOUeTeRU/maxresdefault.jpg\">Broom</a> actually spans about 35 light-years.\n\nThe bright star in the frame is \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/52cyg.html\">52 Cygni</a>,\nvisible with the unaided eye from \na dark location but unrelated to the ancient supernova remnant.",
