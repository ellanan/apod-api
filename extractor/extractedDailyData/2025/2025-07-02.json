  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Milky Way always rise between these two rocks?\n\nNo.\n\nCapturing this stunning alignment took careful planning: \nbeing in the right place at the right time.\n\nIn the featured image taken in June 2024 from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6Ps7dcKcqS8\">Otago</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a>, the bright \n<a href=\"ap231201.html\">central core</a> of our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, home to the many of our \nGalaxy's 400 billion stars,\ncan be seen between two picturesque rocks spires. \n\nFor observers in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/\">Earth</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere\">Northern Hemisphere</a>, the core is only visible throughout the summer.\n\nAs Earth orbits the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>, \ndifferent parts of the Milky Way \nbecome visible at different angles at different times of the \n<a href=\"ap240228.html\">night</a>.\n\nAs Earth rotates, the orientation of the \nMilky Way in the sky also shifts -- sometimes \n<a href=\"ap190112.html\">standing vertically</a> \nas seen in the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8qW2gMJcaF/\">featured image</a>, and other times \n<a href=\"ap241105.html\">stretching parallel</a> to the horizon, \nmaking it harder to see.\n\nIn early June, \n<a href=\"https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2G61P84/curious-dog-funny-pug-looking-through-binoculars-up-in-the-sky-high-angle-owner-holding-a-tool-moon-reflecting-in-lenses-2G61P84.jpg\">observers can watch</a> it emerge \nlow on the horizon after sunset and gradually \narc upward to reveal its full grandeur.",
