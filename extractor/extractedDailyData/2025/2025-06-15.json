  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow different does sunset appear from Mars than from Earth?\n\nFor comparison, two images of our common star were taken at \n<a href=\"ap140302.html\">sunset</a>, one from Earth and one from Mars.\n\nThese images were scaled to have the same angular width and are\n<a href=\"http://www.db-prods.net/blog/2015/05/06/coucher-de-soleil-sur-mars/\">featured here</a> side-by-side.\n\nA quick inspection will reveal that the \n<a href=\"http://hudsonvalleygeologist.blogspot.com/2012/04/size-of-sun.html\">Sun appears</a> slightly smaller from \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/facts/\">Mars</a> than from \n<a href=\"ap220206.html\">Earth</a>.\n\nThis makes sense since \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a> is 50% further from the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> than \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/\">Earth</a>.\n\nMore striking, perhaps, is that the \n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/0506-sunset-on-mars\">Martian sunset</a> is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">typically</a> orange \n<a href=\"https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-2/Blue-Skies-and-Red-Sunsets\">colors</a> near the setting Sun from Earth.\n\nThe reason for the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_on_Mars#The_color_of_the_sky\">blue hues from Mars</a> is \n<a href=\"http://www.dogtreatkitchen.com/image-files/dog_treat_ingredients.jpg\">not fully understood</a>, but thought to be related to \nforward scattering properties of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_soil#Atmospheric_dust\">Martian dust</a>.\n\nThe terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/G87bG7XzaPk\">Marseille</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s robotic \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/\">Curiosity rover</a> from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale_%28crater%29\">Gale crater</a> on \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSIZcj8WgA\">Mars</a>.",
