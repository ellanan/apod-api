  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat does the Milky Way look like in radio waves?\n\nTo better find out, \n<a href=\"https://www.mwatelescope.org/science/galactic-science/gleam/\">GLEAM</a> surveyed the \n<a href=\"ap250209.html\">central band</a> of our galaxy in \nhigh resolution radio light as imaged by the \n<a href=\"https://www.mwatelescope.org/\">Murchison Widefield Array</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>. \n\nAs the \n<a href=\"https://www.icrar.org/gleam-x-galactic-plane/\">featured video</a> slowly scrolls, \nradio light (71 - 231 MHz) is seen on the left \nand visible light -- from the same field -- on the right.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/pd6d24/good_people_of_reddit_help_us_name_this_duo/#lightbox\">Differences</a> are so great because most objects glow differently in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves/\">radio</a> and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/\">visible</a> light, \nand because visible light is stopped by nearby interstellar dust.\n\nThese differences are \n<a href=\"ap250414.html\">particularly apparent</a> in the direction \n<a href=\"ap100831.html\">toward</a> the \n<a href=\"ap241124.html\">center of our galaxy</a>, \nseen about a third of the way through. \n\nAmong the many \n<a href=\"https://www.curtin.edu.au/news/media-release/a-new-expansive-view-of-the-milky-way-reveals-our-galaxy-in-unprecedented-radio-colour/\">features that appear</a> in the radio, bright red patches are usually \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant\">supernova remnant</a>s of exploded stars, \nwhile areas colored blue are \n<a href=\"ap250708.html\">stellar nurseries</a> filled with bright young stars.",
