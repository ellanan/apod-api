  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat was so super about Wednesday's supermoon? \n\nLast week, a full moon occurred that appeared \nslightly larger and brighter than usual. \n\nThe reason is that \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">the Moon</a>'s fully illuminated \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5415/\">phase</a> \noccurred within a short time from \n<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/perigee\">perigee</a> - when the Moon was its closest to the Earth in its \n<a href=\"https://ophysics.com/f6.html\">elliptical orbit</a>. \n\nAlthough the precise conditions that define a supermoon vary, last \n<a href=\"http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~apod/apod/ap251108.html\">Wednesday's supermoon</a> was surely the closest, largest, and brightest \n<a href=\"ap240915.html\">full moon</a> this year.  \n\nOne reason \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon\">supermoon</a>s \nare popular is because they are so easy to see -- just go outside at \n<a href=\"ap250615.html\">sunset</a> and watch an impressive full moon rise! \n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQrGLAmgsQP/\">Pictured here</a>, Wednesday's supermoon is compared to April's micro moon -- \nwhen a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/\">full Moon occurs</a> near the furthest part of the Moon's orbit -- \nso that it appears slightly <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9te9fe/i_was_nervous_that_the_new_kitten_would_be_scared/#lightbox\">smaller and dimmer</a> than usual. \n\nGiven many definitions, at least one \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/articles/what-is-a-super-moon\">supermoon</a> occurs each year, with another one coming next month (moon-th).",
