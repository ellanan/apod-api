  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse?\n\nThe blue band is real but usually quite hard to see.\n\nThe featured <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range\">HDR</a> image of last week's lunar eclipse, however -- taken from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/l4ep9I3XVog\">Norman</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma\">Oklahoma</a> (USA) \n-- has been digitally processed to exaggerate  \n<a href=\"ap220515.html\">the colors</a>. \n\nThe gray color on the upper right of the top lunar image is \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/facts/\">the Moon</a>'s \nnatural color, directly illuminated by sunlight.\n\nThe lower parts of the Moon on all three images \nare not directly lit by the Sun since it is \n<a href=\"ap210525.html\">being eclipsed</a> -- it is in the \n<a href=\"ap211125.html\">Earth's shadow</a>.\n\nIt is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.\n\nThis part of the Moon is red -- and called a \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/blood-moon.html\">blood Moon</a> -- for the same reason that Earth's sunsets are red: \nbecause air scatters away \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/\">more blue</a> light than red.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/sf84rb/does_anyone_elses_dog_tilt_their_head_when_they/#lightbox\">unusual</a> purple-blue band visible on the upper right of \nthe top and middle images is different -- its color is augmented \nby sunlight that has passed high through Earth's atmosphere, where \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/why-does-the-moon-look-red-during-a-total-lunar-eclipse/\">red light</a> is better absorbed by \n<a href=\"https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/SH.html\">ozone</a> than blue.",
