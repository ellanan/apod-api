  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nVery faint planetary nebula Abell 7 is about 1,800 light-years distant.\n\nIt lies just south of Orion in planet Earth's skies toward the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/big/lepus28vm-b.jpg\">Lepus, The Hare</a>.\n\nSurrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to\ndistant background galaxies its\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6226\">generally</a>\nsimple spherical shape, about 8 light-years in diameter, is revealed in\nthis deep telescopic image.\n\nWithin the cosmic cloud are beautiful and complex structures though,\nenhanced by the use of long exposures and\n<a href=\"ap111013.html\">narrowband</a> filters\nthat capture emission from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms.\n\nOtherwise Abell 7 would be much\ntoo faint to be appreciated <a href=\"ap100506.html\">by eye</a>.\n\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>\nrepresents a very brief final phase\nin stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion\n<a href=\"http://www.futuretimeline.net/beyond.htm\">years hence</a>,\nas the nebula's central, once sun-like star shrugs off its outer layers.\n\nAbell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old.\n\nBut its central star, seen here as a\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/citizen-scientist-finds-ancient-white-dwarf-star-encircled-by-puzzling-rings\">fading white dwarf</a>,\nis some 10 billion years old.",
