  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap240504.html\">This might look like</a> a double-bladed\nlightsaber, but these two cosmic jets actually beam outward from\n<a href=\"https://www.stsci.edu/contents/media/images/2015/42/3656-Image\">a newborn star in a galaxy near you</a>.\n\nConstructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning\nscene spans about half a light-year across\nHerbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400\n<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/02/kessel-run-12-parsecs/\">parsecs</a>\naway in the <a href=\"ap131010.html\">stellar nurseries</a>\nof the Orion B molecular cloud complex.\n\nHidden from direct view, HH 24's central protostar is\nsurrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating\naccretion disk.\n\nAs material from the disk falls toward the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/exploring-the-birth-of-stars/\">young stellar object</a>, \nit heats up.\n\nOpposing <a href=\"ap140204.html\">jets are blasted out</a> along the\nsystem's rotation axis.\n\nCutting through the region's interstellar matter, the narrow,\nenergetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts\nalong their path.",
