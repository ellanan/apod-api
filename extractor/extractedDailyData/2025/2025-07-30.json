  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOur Sun frequently erupts in loops. \n\nHot solar \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14299\">plasma</a> jumps off the Sun's surface into \n<a href=\"ap240615.html\">prominences</a>, \nwith the most common type of prominence being a simple loop. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://daily.wordreference.com/2016/09/30/word-of-the-day-loop/\">loop shape</a> originates from the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/\">Sun's magnetic field</a>, \nwhich is traced by spiraling electrons and protons. \n\nMany loops into the Sun's lower \n<a href=\"ap240402.html\">corona</a> \nare large enough to \n<a href=\"ap140304.html\">envelop the Earth</a> \nand are stable enough to last days. \n\nThey commonly occur near active regions that also include dark \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/\">sunspots</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKdCCghIWwv/\">featured</a> panel shows four loops, \neach of which was captured near the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>'s \nedge during 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe images were taken by a personal telescope in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/itj-85yLTK8\">Mantova</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a> and in a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha\">very specific color</a> of light emitted primarily by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/new-evidence-our-neighborhood-in-space-is-stuffed-with-hydrogen/\">hydrogen</a>.\n\nSome solar prominences \n<a href=\"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2yb9w/styles/communityIcon_lqalsz65mlf51.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;s=b08cef3aa70e534d3a5d8fbc180ad4844451779f\">suddenly break open</a> and \n<a href=\"ap240818.html\">eject particles</a> into the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>, setting up a \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/spaceweather/\">space weather</a> sequence that can affect the \n<a href=\"ap230122.html\">skies</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event#Telegraphs\">wires</a> of Earth.",
