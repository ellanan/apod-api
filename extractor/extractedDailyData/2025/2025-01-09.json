  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe colorful, spiky stars\nare in the foreground of this image taken with a small telescope\n<a href=\"https://daveandtelescope.wordpress.com/2025/01/08/a-rose-by-any-other-name/\">on planet Earth</a>.\n\nThey lie well within our own\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nBut the two eye-catching galaxies in the frame lie far beyond the Milky Way,\nat a distance of over 300 million light-years.\n\nThe galaxies' twisted and distorted appearance is due to\nmutual gravitational tides as the pair engage in close encounters.\n\nCataloged as Arp 273 (also as\n<a href=\"ap201018.html\">UGC 1810</a>), these galaxies do look\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html\">peculiar</a>,\nbut interacting galaxies are now understood to be\ncommon in the universe.\n\nCloser to home, the large spiral Andromeda Galaxy is known to be\nsome 2 million light-years away and\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-hubble-shows-milky-way-is-destined-for-head-on-collision/\">inexorably approaching</a>\nthe Milky Way.  \n\nIn fact the far away peculiar galaxies of Arp 273 may\noffer an analog of the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2012/20/3028-Image.html\">far future encounter</a>\nof Andromeda and Milky Way.\n\nRepeated galaxy encounters on a\ncosmic timescale ultimately result in a merger into a single galaxy of stars.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/3872-Image\">From our perspective</a>,\nthe bright cores of the Arp 273 galaxies are\nseparated by only a little over 100,000 light-years.",
