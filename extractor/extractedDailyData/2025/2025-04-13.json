  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created this unusual hole in Mars?\n\nActually, there are numerous holes pictured in this \n<a href=\"ap010327.html\">Swiss cheese-like landscape</a>, \nwith all-but-one of them showing a dusty, dark, Martian terrain beneath \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WABthlGTy74\">evaporating, light, carbon dioxide ice</a>. \n\nThe most <a href=\"ap200301.html\">unusual hole</a> is on the upper right, \nspans about 100 meters, and seems to punch through to a lower level.\n\nWhy <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21636/a-south-polar-pit-or-an-impact-crater\">this hole</a> exists and why it is surrounded by a circular crater remains a topic of \n<a href=\"http://www.lifeinthedoglane.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/puppy-head-tilt.jpg\">speculation</a>, although a leading hypothesis is that it was created by a meteor impact. \n\n\n<a href=\"ap070528.html\">Holes</a> such as \n<a href=\"ap070928.html\">this</a> are of particular interest because they might be portals to lower levels that extend into expansive \n<a href=\"https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/lavamatic/\">underground caves</a>.\n\nIf so, these naturally occurring tunnels are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to \n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-11-volcanic-caves-advances-life-mars.html\">contain Martian life</a>.\n\nThese pits are therefore also prime targets for \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/programs/mars-exploration/\">possible future spacecraft, robots</a>, and even \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles\">human interplanetary explorers</a>.",
