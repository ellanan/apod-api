  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was the strongest gravitational wave signal yet measured -- what did it show? \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW250114\">GW250114</a>\nwas detected by both arms of the \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/\">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory</a> (LIGO) \nin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)\">Washington</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana\">Louisiana</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a> earlier this year. \n\nAnalysis showed that the event was created when two \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/black-holes/\">black holes</a>, each of mass around 33 times the mass of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>, \ncoalesced into one larger \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/\">black hole</a> with a mass of around 63 solar masses. \n\nEven though the event happened about a billion light years away, \nthe signal was so strong that the spin of all \n<a href=\"ap191001.html\">black holes</a>, as well \nas initial \n<a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/first-overtones-heard-ringing-black-hole\">ringing</a> of the final black hole, \nwas deduced with \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ea/de/1f/eade1feca67faed06570cf5495621746.jpg\">exceptional accuracy</a>.\n\nFurthermore, it was confirmed better than before, as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_thermodynamics#Second_law_2\">previously predicted</a>, that the total \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/anatomy/\">event horizon</a> area of the combined black hole was greater than those of the \n<a href=\"ap190414.html\">merging black holes</a>.\n\nFeatured, an \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA/image/ligo20250910a\">artist's illustration</a> depicts an \nimaginative and conceptual view from near one of the \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black holes</a> before collision.",
