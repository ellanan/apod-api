  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBeautiful emission nebula NGC 6164\nwas created by a rare, hot, luminous\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html\">O-type</a>\nstar, some 40 times as massive as the Sun.\n\nSeen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere\n3 to 4 million years old.\n\nIn another three to four million years the massive star will end its\nlife in a <a href=\"ap250108.html\">supernova explosion</a>.\n\nSpanning around 4 light-years,\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/188\">the nebula itself</a>\nhas a bipolar symmetry.\n\nThat makes it similar in appearance to more common and familiar\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebulae</a>\n- the gaseous shrouds\n<a href=\"ap120831.html\">surrounding</a> dying sun-like stars.\n\nAlso like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have\nan extensive,\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1985PASP...97..780F&amp;\">faint halo</a>,\nrevealed in this deep image of the region.\n\nExpanding into the surrounding\n<a href=\"http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar medium</a>,\nthe material in the\nhalo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star.\n\n<a href=\"https://app.astrobin.com/u/dstern?i=rj65f5#gallery\">This gorgeous telescopic view</a>\nis a composite of extensive narrow-band image data,\nhighlighting glowing atomic hydrogen gas in red and oxygen in greenish hues,\nwith broad-band data for the surrounding starfield.\n\nAlso known as the\n<a href=\"ap220607.html\">Dragon's Egg nebula</a>,\nNGC 6164 is 4,200 light-years away in the right-angled southern constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/nor/index.html\">of Norma</a>.",
