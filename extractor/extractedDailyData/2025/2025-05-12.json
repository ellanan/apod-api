  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> look like from the side?\n\nBecause we are on the inside, humanity can’t get an actual picture.\n\nRecently, however, just such a map has \nbeen made using location data for over a billion stars from ESA’s \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)\">Gaia</a> mission.\n\nThe resulting <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/01/The_best_Milky_Way_map_by_Gaia_edge-on\">featured illustration</a> shows that just like \n<a href=\"ap240606.html\">many</a> \n<a href=\"ap220423.html\">other</a> \n<a href=\"ap170112.html\">spiral</a> \n<a href=\"ap141105.html\">galaxies</a>, \nour Milky Way has a very thin central disk.\n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Our Sun</a> \nand all the stars we see at night are in this disk.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/milky-way-more-warped-astronomers-thought\">hypothesized before</a>, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/1cfcrpk/my_dog_is_very_surprised/#lightbox\">more surprising</a> is that the disk appears curved at the outer edges.\n\nThe colors of our Galaxy's \n<a href=\"ap120304.html\">warped</a> \ncentral band derive mostly from dark \n<a href=\"ap100322.html\">dust</a>, \n<a href=\"ap241209.html\">bright blue stars</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap241104.html\">red emission nebulas</a>.\n\nAlthough data analysis is ongoing, <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Farewell_Gaia!_Spacecraft_operations_come_to_an_end\">Gaia was deactivated</a> in March after a successful mission.",
