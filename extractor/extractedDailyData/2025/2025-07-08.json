  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you have looked at the sky and seen a group of \nstars about the size of the full Moon, that's the \n<a href=\"ap241209.html\">Pleiades (M45)</a>.\n\nPerhaps the most famous \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/star-clusters-inside-the-universes-stellar-collections/\">star cluster</a> in the sky, its brightest stars can be seen even from the \n<a href=\"ap200408.html\">light-polluted cities</a>.\n\nBut your unaided eye can also see its nebulosity -- \nthe gas and dust surrounding it -- \n<a href=\"ap230308.html\">under dark skies</a>.\n\nHowever, telescopes can catch even more.\n\nThe bright blue stars of the Pleiades, also known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades#Origin_of_name\">Seven Sisters</a>, light up their surrounding dust, \ncausing it to appear a diffuse blue that can only be seen under long exposures.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://herscheltelescope.org.uk/science/infrared/dust/\">cosmic dust</a> appears to stretch upward like \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Four-cat-lies-like-this-on-us-with-her-arms-stretched-out-v0-b7rxaush7vub1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D4032%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D5cfd7f613fb481e89a980efa704e7fca9382f83a\">ethereal arms</a>.\n\nAnd the entire structure is surrounded by a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha\">reddish glow</a> from the most abundant \n<a href=\"ap230108.html\">element</a> in the universe: hydrogen.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/zcwwdj/\">featured image</a> is composed of nearly 25 hours of exposure \nand was captured last year from \n<a href=\"https://starfront.space/\">Starfront Observatory</a>, in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>",
