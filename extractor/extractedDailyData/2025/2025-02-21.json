  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe largest photomosaic\never assembled from Hubble Space Telescope\nimage data is a panoramic view of our neighboring spiral\nAndromeda Galaxy.\n\nWith 600 overlapping frames assembled from observations made\nfrom July 2010 to December 2022, the full\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2025/005/01JGY8JKWBHBWJ71V3QQTKM382\">Hubble Andromeda Galaxy mosaic</a>\nspans almost six full moons across\n<a href=\"ap200925.html\">planet Earth's sky</a>.\n\nA cropped version shown above is\nnearly two full moons across and partially covers Andromeda's core\nand inner spiral arms.\n\nAlso known as M31, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy\">Andromeda Galaxy is</a>\n2.5 million light-years away.\n\nThat makes it the closest large spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way.\n\nOur perspective on the spiral Milky Way is\n<a href=\"ap110520.html\">anchored to the view</a> from the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">location of the Sun</a>,\na star found within the Milky Way's galactic disk.\n\nBut Hubble's magnificent Andromeda mosaic offers an expansive\nview of a large spiral galaxy from the outside looking in.\n\nHubble's comprehensive,\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...755..131R/abstract\">detailed</a>\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...979...35C/abstract\">data set</a>\nextending\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-hubble-traces-hidden-history-of-andromeda-galaxy/\">across the Andromeda Galaxy</a>\nwill allow astronomers to make an\nunprecedented holistic exploration of the\nmysteries of spiral galaxy structure and evolution.",
