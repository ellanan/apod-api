  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis surprising sky has almost everything. \n\nFirst, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the \n<a href=\"ap220313.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nMore modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> is a \n<a href=\"ap110123.html\">bright meteor</a>.\n\nThe dim band of light across the central diagonal is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light\">zodiacal light</a>: \nsunlight reflected from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust\">dust</a> in the inner \n<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>.\n\nThe green glow on the far right is \n<a href=\"ap240612.html\">aurora</a> high in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nThe bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom \nis just a light that was held by the scene-planning \n<a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/observing/capturing-the-cosmos-how-to-be-an-astrophotographer/\">astrophotographer</a>.\n\nThis \"<a href=\"ap201021.html\">almost everything</a>\" \nsky was captured over rocks on \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6NM2c15BHBM\">Castle Hill</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a> \nlate last month. \n\nThe featured <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DHse6P6uKZj/\">finished frame</a> is a combination of 10 exposures all \ntaken with the same camera and from the same location. \n\nBut what about the astrophotographer himself?  \n\nHe's pictured too -- can you \n<a href=\"https://www.mediastorehouse.co.uk/p/617/tabby-kitten-looking-pot-plant-9446207.jpg\">find him</a>?",
