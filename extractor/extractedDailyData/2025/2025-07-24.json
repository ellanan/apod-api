  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap090319.html\">Every 15 years or so</a>,\nSaturn's rings are tilted edge-on to our line of sight.\n\nAs the bright, beautiful ring system grows narrower and fainter it\nbecomes increasingly difficult to see for denizens of\n<a href=\"ap241123.html\">planet Earth</a>.\n\nBut it does provide the opportunity to watch transits of Saturn's moons\nand their dark shadows across the ringed gas giant's still bright disk.\n\nOf course Saturn's largest\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/\">moon Titan</a>\nis the easiest to spot in transit.\n\nIn this telescopic snapshot from July 18,\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/webbs-titan-forecast-partly-cloudy-with-occasional-methane-showers/\">Titan itself</a> is at the upper\nleft, casting a round dark shadow on Saturn's banded\n<a href=\"ap170916.html\">cloudtops</a> above the narrow rings.\n\nIn fact\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/observing-news/titan-shadow-transit-season-underway/\">Titan's transit season</a>\nis in full swing now with shadow transits\nevery 16 days corresponding to the moon's orbital period.\n\nIts final shadow transit will be on October 6, though Titan's pale disk\nwill continue to cross in front of\nSaturn as seen from telescopes on planet Earth every 16 days\nthrough January 25, 2026.",
