  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat’s happening over that tree?\n\nTwo very different things.\n\nOn the left is the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy\">Andromeda galaxy</a>, \nan object that is older than \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution\">humanity</a> and will \n<a href=\"ap220606.html\">last billions</a> of years into the future. \n\nAndromeda \n(<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-31/\">M31</a>) is similar in size and shape to our own \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nOn the right is a red \n<a href=\"ap210104.html\">sprite</a>, a type of \n<a href=\"https://www.lightningmaps.org/\">lightning</a> \nthat lasts a fraction of a second and occurs above \n<a href=\"ap170226.html\">violent thunderstorms</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap231002.html\">Red sprites</a> were \n<a href=\"https://media.tenor.com/ogsH7Ailje8AAAAe/cat-funny-cat.png\">verified</a> as \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/general/spritacular-nasas-new-citizen-science-project-to-capture-elusive-upper-atmospheric-electrical-phenomena-on-camera/\">real atmospheric phenomena</a> only about 35 years ago. \n\nThe tree in the center is a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_gregorii\">boab</a>, \nwhich may live for as long as a thousand years. \n\nBoab trees grow naturally in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a> \nand are known for being able to store large amounts of water: up to 100,000 liters. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPvsritieGH/\">featured image</a> was captured last month near \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/XTjuah-w1Og\">Derby</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia\">Western Australia</a>.",
