  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but can your rainbow do this?\n\nLate in the day, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> set as usual toward the west.\n\nHowever, on this day, the more interesting display was \n<a href=\"https://byjus.com/maths/180-degree-angle/\">180 degrees</a> around -- toward the east.\n\nThere, not only was a \n<a href=\"ap221127.html\">rainbow</a> visible, \nbut an impressive display of \n<a href=\"ap101128.html\">anticrepuscular rays</a> \nfrom the rainbow's center.\n\nIn the featured image from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/XuEXupOjC8A\">Lekeitio</a> in northern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, \nthe Sun is behind the camera.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow\">rainbow</a> \nresulted from sunlight reflecting back from falling rain.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticrepuscular_rays\">Anticrepuscular rays</a> result from sunlight, blocked by some clouds, \ngoing all the way \n<a href=\"ap190624.html\">around the sky</a>, overhead, \nand appearing to converge on the opposite horizon -- an optical illusion. \n\n<a href=\"ap221227.html\">Rainbows</a> by themselves can be exciting to see, and \n<a href=\"ap200318.html\">anticrepuscular rays</a> a \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/550x/81/21/c0/8121c0291fa14d1fe52b9eb007741cac.jpg\">rare treat</a>, but capturing them both together is even more unusual -- \nand can look both serene and surreal.",
