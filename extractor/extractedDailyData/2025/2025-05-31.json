  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn May 7,\nthe Sun setting behind a church bell tower was captured in this filtered\nand manipulated digital skyscape from Ragusa, Sicily, planet Earth.\n\nIn this version of the image the colors look bizarre.\n\nStill, an intriguing optical illusion known as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage\">an afterimage</a>\ncan help you\nexperience the same scene with a more natural looking appearance.\n\nTo try it,\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/sunspots/\">find the sunspots</a>\nof active region\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/online-gallery/ar4079-giant-sunspot-with-eyes/\">AR4079</a>\ngrouped near the bottom of the blue solar disk.\n\nRelax and stare at the dark sunspot group\nfor about 30 seconds, then close your eyes or\nshift your gaze to a plain white surface.\n\nIn a moment an afterimage of the sunset should faintly appear.\n\nBut the afterimage sunset will have this image's complementary colors\nand a more normal yellow Sun against a familiar blue sky.",
