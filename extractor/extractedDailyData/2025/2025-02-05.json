  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere is Comet ATLAS going?\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DFdvObFxHO9/\">featured time-lapse video</a>, the comet is not itself moving very much, \nbut the \n<a href=\"ap090909.html\">Earth's rotation</a> makes it appear to be setting \n<a href=\"ap210921.html\">over a hill</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_(ATLAS)\">Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)</a> sequence was captured \nwith an ordinary camera on January 22 from the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6dVlY85KzpA\">Araucanía Region</a> in central \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.\n\nComet ATLAS has been an impressive site in the evening skies of \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere\">Southern Hemisphere</a> over the past few weeks, \nso bright and awe-inspiring that it may eventually become known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_comet\">Great Comet</a> of 2025.\n\nUnfortunately, \n<a href=\"ap250126.html\">Comet G3 ATLAS</a> is \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/9c/3e/079c3ea0dce59cc171629800294b0f3d.jpg\">not going anywhere anymore</a> because its central \n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-atlas-caught-in-the-act-of-disintegration/\">nucleus broke up</a> during its close pass to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> last month.\n\nSome of the comet's \n<a href=\"ap230903.html\">scattered remains</a> of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/\">rocks and ice</a> will continue to \n<a href=\"ap240811.html\">orbit the Sun</a>, some in nearly the same \noutward section of the orbit that the \n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/space-images/cometary-nuclei-to-scale\">comet's nucleus</a> would have taken.",
