  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSaturn looks slightly different in infrared light.\n\nBands of clouds show great structure, including long \n<a href=\"ap190915.html\">stretching storms</a>. \n\nAlso quite striking in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> is the unusual \n<a href=\"ap130220.html\">hexagonal cloud pattern</a> surrounding \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/\">Saturn</a>'s North Pole. \n\nEach side of the dark \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/hexagon.html\">hexagon</a> spans roughly the width of our Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon\">The hexagon</a>'s existence was not predicted, \nand its origin and likely stability remain a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingFunny/comments/16tjsam/this_funny_dog_studying_for_his_obedience_test/#lightbox\">topics of research</a>.  \n\nSaturn's famous \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/saturn-rings/en/\">rings</a> \ncircle the planet and \n<a href=\"ap120703.html\">cast shadows</a> below the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/equator_.png\">equator</a>.\n\nThe featured image was taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> in 2014 in several infrared colors. \n\nIn 2017 September, the \n<a href=\"ap110613.html\">Cassini mission</a> was brought to a \ndramatic conclusion when the spacecraft was  \n<a href=\"ap170125.html\">directed to dive</a> into the ringed giant.",
