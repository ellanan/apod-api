  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.kentbiggs.com/images/planetaries/M57.htm\">This colorful telescopic view</a>\ntowards the musical northern constellation Lyra\nreveals the faint outer halos and brighter central\nring-shaped region of M57,\npopularly known as the\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01H82G0PP38P6PBXQ11BEVSMY0\">Ring Nebula</a>.\n\nTo modern astronomers M57 is a well-known\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>.\n\nWith a central ring about one light-year across,\n<a href=\"ap230418.html\">M57 is</a>\ndefinitely not a planet though, but\nthe gaseous shroud of one of the Milky Way's\n<a href=\"https://physics.weber.edu/palen/phsx1040/lectures/lplanneb.html\">dying</a>\nsun-like stars.\n\nRoughly the same apparent size as M57, the fainter and\nmore often overlooked barred spiral galaxy at the left is IC 1296.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"ap200430.html\">over 100 years ago</a>\nIC 1296 would have been known as a\n<a href=\"https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html\">spiral nebula</a>.\n\nBy chance the pair are in the same field of view, and while they\nappear to have similar sizes they are actually very far apart.\n\nAt a distance of a mere 2,000 light-years\nM57 is well within our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"ap211106.html\">Extragalactic</a>\nIC 1296 (aka PGC62532) is more like 200,000,000 light-years distant.\n\nThat's about  100,000 times farther away than M57\nbut since they appear roughly similar in size, former spiral nebula IC 1296\nmust also be about 100,000\n<a href=\"https://chandra.si.edu/photo/scale.html\">times larger</a> than planetary nebula M57.\n\nLook closely at the sharp 21st century astroimage to spot\neven more distant background galaxies\n<a href=\"https://www.kentbiggs.com/images/planetaries/M57.htm\">scattered through the frame</a>.",
