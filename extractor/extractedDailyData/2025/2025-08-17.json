  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhat kind of clouds are these?\n\nAlthough their cause is presently unknown, such unusual atmospheric structures, \nas menacing as they might seem, do not appear to be harbingers of \n<a href=\"ap170226.html\">meteorological doom</a>.\n\nFormally recognized as a distinct \n<a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/webweather/clouds/cloud-types\">cloud type</a> only last year, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperitas_(cloud)\">asperitas</a> \nclouds can be stunning in appearance, \nunusual in occurrence, and are relatively unstudied.\n\nWhereas most low cloud decks are <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/277662/why-do-clouds-generally-look-flat-at-the-bottom\">flat bottomed</a>, \n<a href=\"http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/asperatus-update/comment-page-2/\">asperitas clouds</a> appear to have significant \n<a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/funny-cats-dogs-stuck-furniture-31.jpg\">vertical structure</a> underneath.\n\nSpeculation therefore holds that \n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/06/20/asperatus-cloud-atlas/28994525/\">asperitas clouds</a> might be related to \n<a href=\"ap090121.html\">lenticular clouds</a> that form near mountains, \nor <a href=\"ap230212.html\">mammatus clouds</a> associated with thunderstorms, \nor perhaps a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind\">foehn</a> -- \na type of dry downward wind that flows off mountains.\n\nClouds from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nor%27west_arch\">such a wind</a> \ncalled the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_arch\">Canterbury arch</a> \nstream toward the east coast of New Zealand's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island,_New_Zealand\">South Island</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wittap/4406137868/in/set-72157623581503907\">featured image</a><a>, taken above \n</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn7ck-N53k0\">Hanmer Springs</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Region\">Canterbury</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a> in 2005, \nshows great detail partly because sunlight illuminates the undulating \n<a href=\"https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/\">clouds</a> from the side.",
