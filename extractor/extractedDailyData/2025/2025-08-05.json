  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is this nebula so complex?\n\nThe <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/home\">Webb Space Telescope</a> has imaged a nebula \nin great detail that is thought to have emerged from a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>-like star.\n\n<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2514a/\">NGC 6072</a> has been resolved into one of the \nmore unusual and complex examples of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/goddard/nasas-webb-traces-details-of-complex-planetary-nebula/\">featured image</a> is in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/\">infrared light</a> with the red color highlighting cool \n<a href=\"ap010113.html\">hydrogen</a> gas.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...708...93K/abstract\">Study of previous images</a> of NGC 6072 indicated several likely \n<a href=\"ap240627.html\">outflows</a> and two \n<a href=\"ap231017.html\">disk</a>s inside the jumbled gas, \nwhile the new Webb image resolves new features \nlikely including one disk's edge protruding on the central left. \n\nA <a href=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0bzc0wl.jpg\">leading</a> \norigin hypothesis holds that the nebula's complexity is caused or enhanced by multiple outbursts from a star in a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/multiple-star-systems/\">multi-star system</a> near the center.",
