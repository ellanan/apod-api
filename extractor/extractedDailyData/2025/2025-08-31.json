  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created this unusual planetary nebula?\n\nDubbed the Pillow Nebula and the Flying Carpet Nebula, \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic2011/\">NGC 7027</a> is one of the smallest, brightest, and most unusually shaped \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>s known.\n\nGiven its expansion rate, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7027\">NGC 7027</a> first started expanding, as visible from Earth, about 600 years ago. \n\nFor much of its history, the planetary nebula has been expelling shells, \nas seen in blue in the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSDeLRLgthJ/\">featured image</a> by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nIn modern times, though, for \n<a href=\"https://i.imgflip.com/2225wb.jpg\">reasons unknown</a>, \nit began ejecting gas and dust (seen in brown) in specific directions \nthat created a new pattern that seems to have \n<a href=\"ap210926.html\">four corners</a>.\n\nWhat lies at the nebula's center is unknown, with \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AAS...23530703K/abstract\">one hypothesis</a> holding it to be a \n<a href=\"ap060521.html\">close binary star system</a> \nwhere one star sheds gas onto an erratic disk orbiting the other star.\n\nNGC 7027, about 3,000 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light years</a> \naway, was first discovered in 1878 and \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic2011d/\">can be seen</a> \nwith a standard backyard telescope toward the \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/definition-what-is-a-constellation-asterism\">constellation</a> of the Swan \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)\">Cygnus</a>).",
