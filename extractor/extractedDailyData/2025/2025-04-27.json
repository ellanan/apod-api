  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is creating the strange texture of IC 418?  \n\nDubbed the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubbles-spirograph/\">Spirograph Nebula</a> for its resemblance to drawings from a\n<a href=\"http://www.wordsmith.org/~anu/java/spirograph.html\">cyclical drawing tool</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> IC 418 shows\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph\">patterns</a>\nthat are not well understood.\n\nPerhaps they are related to chaotic\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\">winds</a> from the variable central star, which\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997A%26A...320..125H/abstract\">changes brightness unpredictably</a> in just a few hours.  \n\nBy contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago,\n<a href=\"http://observing.skyhound.com/archives/jan/IC_418.html\">IC 418</a> was probably a well-understood star similar to our\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>.  \n\nOnly a few thousand years ago,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_418\">IC 418</a> was probably a common\n<a href=\"http://www.historyoftheuniverse.com/starold.html\">red giant</a> star.  \n\nSince running out of\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E-0j90Cwpk\">nuclear fuel</a>, though, the outer envelope has begun\nexpanding outward leaving a <a href=\"ap100221.html\">hot remnant core</a> destined to become a\n<a href=\"ap000910.html\">white-dwarf star</a>, visible in the\nimage center.\n\nThe light from the central core excites surrounding\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/tryit/atom/\">atoms</a> in the\n<a href=\"planetary_nebulae.html\">nebula</a> causing them to glow.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...507.1517M/abstract\">IC 418</a> lies about 2000\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a> away and spans 0.3 light-years across.  \n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/the-spirograph-nebula-ic-418/\">This false-color image</a> taken from the\n<a href=\"https://www.stsci.edu/hst\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nreveals the \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/8smej7/surprised_cat/#lightbox\">unusual details</a>.",
