  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat’s causing those lines?\n\nObjects in the sky sometimes appear \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)\">reflected</a> as lines across water — but why?\n\nIf the water’s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would \n<a href=\"ap191022.html\">appear similarly</a> -- as spots.\n\nBut if the \n<a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle\">water</a> is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line.\n\nThe same effect is frequently seen for the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> just \n<a href=\"ap090924.html\">before sunset</a> and just \n<a href=\"ap220924.html\">after sunrise</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DI3Aq4OI_Fs/\">Pictured</a> about 10 days ago in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yDYCMdbaFdQ\">Ibiza</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, \nimages of the \n<a href=\"ap150929.html\">rising Moon</a>, \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-venus/\">Venus</a> (top), and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/\">Saturn</a> \n(right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a>.\n\nThe other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a \n<a href=\"ap191119.html\">beacon</a> on a rock to warn passing boats.",
