  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow much of planet Earth is made of water?\n\nVery little, actually.\n\nAlthough\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSBExlLu2M\">oceans of water</a> cover about 70 percent of Earth's surface, these oceans are\n<a href=\"http://www.cliffshade.com/colorado/images/earth_anatomy.gif\">shallow compared</a> to the Earth's radius.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/how-much-water-there-earth-0\">featured illustration</a> \nshows what would happen if all of\n<a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/all-earths-water-a-single-sphere\">the water</a> on or near the surface of the Earth were bunched up into a \n<a href=\"https://i.redd.it/n6ujzlqv19p51.jpg\">ball</a>.\n\nThe radius of this ball would be only about 700 kilometers, \nless than half the radius of the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Earth's Moon</a>, and slightly smaller than Saturn's moon\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_(moon)\">Rhea</a> which, like many moons in our outer \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>, is mostly water ice.\n\nThe next smallest ball depicts all of \n<a href=\"ap220206.html\">Earth</a>'s liquid fresh water, while the tiniest ball \nshows the volume of all of Earth's \n<a href=\"ap181218.html\">fresh-water lake</a>s and \n<a href=\"ap180826.html\">river</a>s.\n\nHow any of this \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth\">water came</a> to be on\n<a href=\"ap970316.html\">the Earth</a> and whether any significant amount is\ntrapped far\n<a href=\"https://ssec.si.edu/stemvisions-blog/there-ocean-below-your-feet\">beneath Earth</a>'s surface remain \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17906\">topic</a>s of research.",
