  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo you see the ring? \n\nIf you look very closely at the center of the featured galaxy \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6505\">NGC 6505</a>, \na ring becomes evident.\n\nIt is the gravity of \n<a href=\"https://www.euclid-ec.org/einstein-ring-in-ngc-6505/\">NGC 6505</a>, the nearby \n(<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-behind-the-discoveries/hubble-cosmological-redshift/\">z</a> = 0.042) \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a> that you can easily see, \nthat is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/spff2s/psbattle_this_dog_staring_at_the_camera/#lightbox\">magnifying and distorting</a> the image of a \n<a href=\"ap210802.html\">distant galaxy</a> into a complete circle.\n\nTo create a complete \n<a href=\"ap111221.html\">Einstein ring</a> there must be \nperfect alignment of the nearby galaxy's center \nand part of the background galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06505\">Analysis</a> of this ring and the multiple images of the background galaxy help to determine the mass and fraction of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/dark-matter-dark-energy/\">dark matter</a> in NGC 6505's center, \nas well as uncover previously \n<a href=\"ap220705.html\">unseen details</a> in the distorted galaxy. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/euclid-discovers-einstein-ring-in-our-cosmic-backyard/\">featured image</a> was captured by \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>'s Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid_overview\">Euclid telescope</a> in 2023 and released earlier this month.",
