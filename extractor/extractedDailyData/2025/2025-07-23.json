  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever seen a fireball? \n\nIn astronomy, a \n<a href=\"https://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/\">fireball</a> is a very bright \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/\">meteor</a> -- one at least as bright as \n<a href=\"ap230306.html\">Venus</a> and possibly brighter than even a \nfull <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5415/\">Moon</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap230916.html\">Fireball</a>s are rare -- \nif you see one you are likely to \n<a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-scottish-fold-cat-head-600nw-1276621966.jpg\">remember it</a> for your whole life. \n\nPhysically, a \n<a href=\"ap211012.html\">fireball</a> is a small rock that \n<a href=\"ap231126.html\">originated</a> from an \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/\">asteroid</a> or \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_nucleus\">comet</a> that typically leaves a fading smoke \n<a href=\"ap190430.html\">trail</a> of gas and dust as it \nshoots through the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nIt is unlikely that any single large ground strike occurred -- much of the rock likely vaporized as it broke up into many small pieces.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLa5D4sxVag/\">featured picture</a> was \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLaPqFTRiAx/\">captured</a> last week from a deadwood beach in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCQhTcFGiSE\">Cape San Blas</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida\">Florida</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a>.",
