  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSeen as a seagull and a duck, \nthese nebulae are not the only\n<a href=\"ap080719.html\">cosmic clouds</a> to\n<a href=\"ap221121.html\">evoke images</a> of flight.\n\nBut both are winging their way across this broad\ncelestial landscape, spanning almost 7 degrees across\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">planet Earth</a>'s \nnight sky toward the constellation of the Big Dog \n(<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/\ncanismajor.html\">Canis Major</a>).\n\nThe <a href=\"ap090327.html\">expansive Seagull</a>\n(top center)\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/113243238@N08/38742044570/\">is itself composed of</a> two major cataloged\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula\">emission nebulas</a>.\n\nBrighter NGC 2327 forms the head with the more diffuse\nIC 2177 as the wings and body.\n\nImpressively, the Seagull's\nwingspan would correspond to about 250 \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/\">light-year</a>s at\nthe nebula's estimated distance of 3,800 light-years.\n\nAt the lower right, the Duck appears much more compact and\nwould span only about 50 light-years given its\n15,000 light-year distance estimate.\n\nBlown by \n<a href=\"ap250203.html\">energetic winds</a> from an extremely massive,\nhot star near its center, the Duck nebula is cataloged\nas NGC 2359.\n\nOf course, the Duck's thick body and winged appendages\nalso lend it the slightly more \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3M2YKeaTXIY/hq720.jpg\">dramatic</a> popular moniker,\n<a href=\"ap240109.html\">Thor's Helmet</a>.",
