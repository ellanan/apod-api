  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn the Mars rover's mission Sol 46 or Earth date April 6, 2021,\nPerseverance held out a robotic arm to take\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/perseverances-selfie-with-ingenuity\">its first selfie on Mars</a>.\n\nThe WATSON camera at the end of the arm\nwas designed to take close-ups of Martian rocks and\nsurface details though, and not a quick snap shot of friends and\nsmiling faces.\n\nIn the end,\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/watch-and-hear-how-nasa-s-perseverance-rover-took-its-first-selfie\">teamwork and weeks of planning on Mars time</a>\nwas required to program a complex series of\nexposures and camera motions to include Perseverance and its\nsurroundings.\n\nThe resulting 62 frames were composed into a detailed mosaic,\none of the most complicated Mars rover selfies ever taken.\n\nIn this version of the\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">selfie, the rover's</a>\nMastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments are looking\ntoward WATSON and the end of the rover's outstretched arm.\n\nAbout 4 meters (13 feet) from Perseverance is a robotic companion,\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/\">the Mars Ingenuity helicopter</a>.\n\nPerseverance has now spent over 1,500 sols\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/devils-in-details-in-selfie-taken-by-nasas-mars-perseverance-rover/\">exploring the surface</a>\nof the Red Planet.\n\nOn Earth date January 18, 2024, Ingenuity made its 72nd and\n<a href=\"ap240210.html\">final flight</a> through the thin Martian atmosphere.",
