  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIts surface is the most densely cratered in the Solar System -- but what's inside? \n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>'s moon \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-moons/callisto/\">Callisto</a> is a battered ball of dirty ice \nthat is slightly smaller than the planet \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/\">Mercury</a>.\n\nIt was visited by NASA's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/galileo/\">Galileo spacecraft</a> in the 1990s and 2000s, but the recently reprocessed \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Callisto_-_July_8_1979_(38926064465).jpg\">featured image</a> \nis from a flyby of NASA's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/voyager-2/\">Voyager 2</a> in 1979. \n\nThe moon would appear darker if it weren't for the tapestry of light-colored \n<a href=\"https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/black-cat-pawing-broken-glass-window-s-paw-reaches-its-sharp-claws-visible-shards-scattered-around-creating-334701018.jpg\">fractured</a> surface ice created by eons of impacts.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap981106.html\">interior of Callisto</a> \nis potentially even more interesting because therein might lie an internal layer of liquid water.\n\nThis potential \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/ocean-inside-jupiters-moon-callisto-may-have-cushioned-big-impact/\">underground sea</a> is a candidate to \n<a href=\"https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/astrobiological-potential-of-callisto\">harbor life</a> -- similar with sister moons \n<a href=\"ap240329.html\">Europa</a> and \n<a href=\"ap231128.html\">Ganymede</a>. \n\nCallisto is larger than \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(name)\">Luna</a>, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Earth's Moon</a>, and even with its high ice content is still more massive.\n\nESA's \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice\">JUICE</a> and NASA's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/\">Europa Clipper</a> missions are now headed \n<a href=\"ap170523.html\">out to Jupiter</a> \nto better investigate its \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia01299-the-galilean-satellites/\">largest moons</a>.",
