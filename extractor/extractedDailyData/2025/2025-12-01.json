  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow typical is our Solar System? \n\nStudying <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/planetary-defense/2025/07/02/nasa-discovers-interstellar-comet-moving-through-solar-system/\">3I/ATLAS</a>, a comet just passing through, is providing clues. \n\nConfirmed previous interstellar visitors include an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1I/%CA%BBOumuamua\">asteroid</a>, \na <a href=\"ap220305.html\">comet</a>, \na <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1092869771/interstellar-meteor-hit-earth-in-2014\">meteor</a>, and a \n<a href=\"https://sci.esa.int/web/ulysses/-/35853-the-flow-of-interstellar-helium-in-the-solar-system\">gas wind</a> dominated by hydrogen and helium.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3I/ATLAS\">Comet 3I/ATLAS</a> \nappears \n<a href=\"https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/3i-atlas-not-aliens\">relatively normal</a> when compared to \n<a href=\"ap090207.html\">Solar</a> \n<a href=\"ap200606.html\">System</a> \n<a href=\"ap231020.html\">comets</a>, \ntherefore providing more evidence that \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/\">our Solar System</a> is a somewhat typical star system. \n\nFor example, Comet 3I/ATLAS has a broadly similar \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/annual-reports/2012/uh/the-chemical-composition-of-comets/index.html\">chemical composition</a> and \n<a href=\"ap231126.html\">ejected dust</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://app.astrobin.com/i/jtmq82\">featured image</a> \nwas captured last week from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a> and shows a \n<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/why-do-some-comets-glow-green\">green coma</a>, a wandering\n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/Cometary+Gas+Tail\">blue-tinted ion tail</a> likely deflected by our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/what-is-the-solar-wind/\">Sun's wind</a>, and a slight \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_tail#Anti-tail\">anti-tail</a>, all typical cometary attributes. \n\nThe comet, visible with \n<a href=\"https://1funny.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dog-telescope.jpg\">a telescope</a>, passed its closest to the Sun in late October and will pass its closest to the Earth in mid-December, \nafter which it will return to \n<a href=\"ap241222.html\">interstellar space</a> and never return.",
