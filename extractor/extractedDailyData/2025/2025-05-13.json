  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> look like from the top?\n\nBecause we are on the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/104vf2/so_my_cat_likes_to_look_out_the_window/#lightbox\">inside</a>, humanity can’t get an actual picture.\n\nRecently, however, just such a map has \nbeen made using location data for over a billion stars from ESA’s \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)\">Gaia</a> mission.\n\nThe resulting <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/01/The_best_Milky_Way_map_by_Gaia_edge-on\">featured illustration</a> shows that just like \n<a href=\"ap241226.html\">many</a> \n<a href=\"ap240206.html\">other</a> \n<a href=\"ap240101.html\">spiral</a> \n<a href=\"ap011004.html\">galaxies</a>, \nour Milky Way has distinct spiral arms. \n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Our Sun</a> \nand most of the bright stars we see at night are in just one arm: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm\">Orion</a>.\n\nGaia data bolsters previous indications \nthat our Milky Way has more than two \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#Spiral_arms\">spiral arms</a>.\n\nOur <a href=\"ap241124.html\">Galaxy's center</a> sports a \n<a href=\"ap050825.html\">prominent bar</a>. \n\nThe colors of our Galaxy's \n<a href=\"ap250512.html\">thin</a> disk derive mostly from dark \n<a href=\"ap100322.html\">dust</a>, \n<a href=\"ap241209.html\">bright blue stars</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap241104.html\">red emission nebula</a>.\n\nAlthough data analysis is ongoing, <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Farewell_Gaia!_Spacecraft_operations_come_to_an_end\">Gaia was deactivated</a> in March after a successful mission.",
