  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe dark, inner shadow of planet Earth\nis called <a href=\"ap060909.html\">the umbra</a>.\n\nShaped like a cone extending into space, it has a\ncircular cross section most easily seen during a\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/lunar-eclipses/\">lunar\neclipse</a>.\n\nAnd on the night of September 7/8 the\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/total-lunar-eclipse-september-7-2025/\">Full Moon passed</a>\nnear the center of Earth's umbral cone,\n<a href=\"ap190125.html\">entertaining</a>\neclipse watchers around much of our fair planet,\nincluding parts of Antarctica, Australia, Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\nRecorded from Zhangjiakou City, China,\nthis timelapse composite image uses\nsuccessive pictures from\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/eclipses/\">the total lunar eclipse</a>,\nprogressing right to left, to reveal the curved cross-section of the\n<a href=\"ap080820.html\">umbral shadow</a> sliding across the Moon.\n\nSunlight scattered by the atmosphere into Earth's umbra\ncauses the lunar surface to appear reddened during totality.\n\nBut close to the umbra's edge, the limb of the eclipsed Moon shows a\ndistinct blue hue.\n\n<a href=\"ap151003.html\">The blue eclipsed</a>\nmoonlight originates as rays of sunlight\npass through layers high in the upper stratosphere,\ncolored by ozone that scatters red light and transmits blue.\n\nIn the total phase of this\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse#Total_lunar_eclipse\">leisurely lunar eclipse</a>,\nthe Moon was completely within the Earth's umbra for about 83 minutes.",
