  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nComet ATLAS is really bright now, but also really close to the Sun.\n\nOutside the glow of the Sun, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_(ATLAS)\">Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)</a> would be one of the more remarkable comet sights of recent years, reflecting about as much sunlight to Earth as \n<a href=\"ap241019.html\">Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS</a> did in October, \nand now \n<a href=\"ap230306.html\">rivaling</a> even planet \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/venus/\">Venus</a>.\n\nBut the giant snowball is now \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/3dsolarsystem?obj=c2024g3\">so close to the Sun</a> that it can only be seen through the \nlight of the early morning dawn or the early evening dusk.\n\nToday, <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/brightest-comet-of-2025-atlas-g3-southern-hemisphere/\">Comet ATLAS</a> is at \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Perihelion_and_aphelion\">perihelion</a> -- its closest ever to the Sun. \n\nAlthough the future brightness of comets is \n<a href=\"https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/18/45/30/360_F_218453068_WRjhtH9MzO33Cb19K8acZI2VZvXueQ70.jpg\">notoriously hard</a> to predict, there is hope that \n<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2463620-comet-that-could-shine-as-bright-as-venus-set-to-be-visible-from-earth/\">Comet ATLAS</a> will survive its close pass near the Sun and \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info\">remain bright</a> \nenough to be seen with the unaided eye over the next few days -- \nand possibly a good \n<a href=\"ap240131.html\">camera comet</a> for weeks.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=25209\">featured image</a> \nwas taken early yesterday morning near \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torna%C4%BEa\">Tornaľa</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia\">Slovakia</a>.",
