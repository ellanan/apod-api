  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star. \n\nAbout 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/\">supernova</a>, leaving the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_Nebula\">Veil Nebula</a>. \n\nAt the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent \n<a href=\"ap210405.html\">Moon</a>, remaining visible \nfor weeks to people living at the \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/334517.stm\">dawn of recorded history</a>. \n\nToday, the resulting \n<a href=\"supernova_remnants.html\">supernova remnant</a>, \nalso known as the \n<a href=\"ap200928.html\">Cygnus Loop</a>, has faded and is \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_O7l9m2pFXM\">now visible</a> only through a small \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3qOmu-5Uanc\">telescope</a> directed toward the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation\">constellation</a> \nof the Swan \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)\">Cygnus</a>). \n\nThe remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, \nand even though it lies about 1,400 \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/\">light-year</a>s distant, it covers over five times the size of the \n<a href=\"ap240915.html\">full Moon</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/194569375@N06/53908601291/\">featured picture</a> was taken in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait\">Kuwait</a> \nin mid-2024 and features light emitted by \n<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydrogen/use-of-hydrogen.php\">hydrogen</a> in red and <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/exoplanets/oxygen-on-exoplanets-isnt-proof-of-life/\">oxygen</a> in blue. \n\nIn deep images of the \n<a href=\"ap191031.html\">complete Veil Nebula</a> like this, even \n<a href=\"https://previews.123rf.com/images/duben/duben1907/duben190700009/128483090-dog-reading-book-with-eyeglasses-professor-behind-the-book.jpg\">studious readers</a> might not be able to identify the \n<a href=\"image/2506/VeilWide_Alharbi_960_annotated.jpg\">iconic filaments</a>.",
