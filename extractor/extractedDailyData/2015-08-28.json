  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/puppisa/\">Driven\nby the explosion</a> of a massive star,\nsupernova remnant Puppis A is blasting into the\nsurrounding interstellar medium about 7,000 light-years away.\n\nAt that distance,\n<a href=\"http://astrodonimaging.com/gallery/puppis-a-2/\">this\ncolorful telescopic field</a> based on broadband and narrowband\noptical image data is about 60 light-years across.\n\nAs the supernova remnant expands into its\nclumpy, non-uniform surroundings, shocked filaments\nof oxygen atoms glow in green-blue hues.\n\nHydrogen and nitrogen are in red.\n\nLight from the initial supernova itself, triggered by\nthe collapse of the massive\n<a href=\"ap961114.html\">star's core</a>, would have reached\nEarth about 3,700 years ago.\n\nThe Puppis A remnant is actually seen through\noutlying emission from the closer but more ancient\n<a href=\"ap150101.html\">Vela supernova remnant</a>, near the\ncrowded plane of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nStill glowing across the electromagnetic spectrum\nPuppis A remains one of the brightest sources\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1275\">in the X-ray sky</a>.",
