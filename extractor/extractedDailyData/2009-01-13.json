  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA larger moon will not be seen this year.\n\nThis past weekend, the \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/090109-biggest-full-moon-2009.html\">largest full Moon of 2009</a> \ncould be seen from almost any clear location on planet \n<a href=\"ap081005.html\">Earth at night</a>.\n\nThe large \n<a href=\"ap071025.html\">angular extent</a> \nof the full Moon was caused by the Moon \nbeing unusually close to Earth during its \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">full phase</a>.  \n\n\nBecause the Moon circles the Earth in an <a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/physical_science/physics/mechanics/orbit/ellipse.html\">elliptical orbit</a>, \nits angular size depends on how close the Moon \nis to closest approach (perigee) or farthest distance \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee\">apogee</a>).  \n\nEven so, the Moon's was only about 15 percent larger in area and brightness than a more typical full Moon. \n\nIn\n<a href=\"http://vjac.free.fr/skyshows/moon/fullmoon.html\">this image</a>, \na dramatically positioned Moon is seen\n<a href=\"ap081231.html\">rising</a> above the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a> from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breil-sur-Roya\">Breil-sur-Roya</a> \nin the southeast of France.  \n\nTaken with an ordinary digital camera but extraordinary timing, \nthe image also captured a \n<a href=\"ap070605.html\">crossing jet plane</a>.\n\nThe last full Moon, in 2008 December, was the \n<a href=\"ap081212.html\">largest full moon of 2008</a>.",
