  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is the Andromeda galaxy really like?  \n\nTo find out, astronomers looked at our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m031.html\">largest galactic neighbor</a> \nin a different light: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared\">infrared</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/education/publications/careerbrochure.html\">Astronomers</a> trained the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/geninfo/\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> at the \n<a href=\"ap000311.html\">Messier</a> monster (M31) for over 18 hours, \ncreating a mosaic that incorporated 11,000 separate exposures.  \n\nThe result, <a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2005-20/release.shtml\">pictured above</a>, shows M31 in greater infrared detail than ever before.    \n\nInfrared light in this 24-micron color band is particularly sensitive to \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> heated up by stars.\n\nVisible above are \n<a href=\"http://uanews.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews.woa/1/wa/SRStoryDetails?ArticleID=11798\">previously undiscovered features</a> including intricate structure in the spiral arms, \na spiral arc near the center, an off center ring of star formation, \nand an unusual hole in the galaxy's disk.  \n\nIn contrast, the Andromeda galaxy appears much \n<a href=\"ap040718.html\">smoother in visible light</a> and even \n<a href=\"ap031222.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.   \n\nAnalyses and comparison of this image to other images will likely yield \nclues not only to the violent past of \n<a href=\"ap041227.html\">M31</a> but to our own \n<a href=\"http://cassfos02.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> as well.",
