  "title": "Lunar X",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe striking X near the center of this lunarscape is easily\nvisible in binoculars or a small telescope.\n\nYet, not too many have seen it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOW_DIG/097.HTM\">The catch is,\nthis lunar X</a> is only apparent\nduring a four hour period\njust before the Moon's\n<a href=\"http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/\nmoonphase/\">first quarter phase</a>.\n\nAt the\n<a href=\"http://sci.gallaudet.edu/daylight.html\">terminator, or\nshadow line</a> between lunar day and night,\nthe X illusion is produced by a configuration of the craters\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/usgs/\nI822/\">Blanchinus, La Caille and Purbach</a>.\n\nNear the Moon's first quarter phase, an\n<a href=\"ap001209.html\">astronaut standing</a> close to\nthe craters' position would see the slowly rising Sun very\nnear the horizon.\n\nTemporarily, the\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/science/\ncraterstructure.html\">crater walls</a> would be in sunlight\nwhile the crater floors were still in darkness.\n\nSeen from <a href=\"ap071227.html\">planet Earth</a>,\ncontrasting sections of bright walls against\nthe dark floors by chance look remarkably like an X.\n\nThis sharp image of the Lunar X was captured at approximately 11:59 UT\non March 3, 2009.\n\nThe Moon's first quarter phase was at 7:46 UT on March 4.",
