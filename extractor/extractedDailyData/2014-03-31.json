  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat object has the furthest known orbit in our Solar System?\n\nIn terms of \n<a href=\"http://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/mechanics/orbit/perihelion_aphelion.html\">how close</a> it will ever get to the Sun, \nthe new answer is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_VP113\">2012 VP113</a>, \nan object currently over twice the \n<a href=\"http://www.neoprogrammics.com/jpl_de405/daily_geocentric_pluto_ephemeris/\">distance</a> of \n<a href=\"ap060903.html\">Pluto</a> from the Sun. \n\n<a href=\"http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/inner_oort_cloud/2012VP113images.html\">Pictured above</a> is a series of discovery images taken with the \n<a href=\"http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/DECam/telescope.shtml\">Dark Energy Camera</a> \nattached to the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/about-noao.php\">NOAO</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/Victor-Blanco-4-m-Telescope\">Blanco 4-meter Telescope</a> in Chile in 2012 and released last week.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/dwarf-planet-stretches-solar-system-s-edge-1.14921\">distant object</a>, seen moving on the lower right, is thought to be a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet\">dwarf planet</a> like \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto\">Pluto</a>.\n\nPreviously, the furthest known dwarf planet was \n<a href=\"ap040316.html\">Sedna</a>, discovered in 2003.\n\nGiven how little of the sky was searched, it is likely that as many as 1,000 \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/03261345-a-second-sedna-what-does-it-mean.html\">more objects</a> like \n<a href=\"http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/inner_oort_cloud/\">2012 VP113</a> \nexist in the outer \n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Solar System</a>.\n\n2012 VP113 is \n<a href=\"http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/inner_oort_cloud/sednoids.html\">currently near</a> its closest approach to the Sun, \nin about 2,000 years it will be over five times further.\n\nSome scientists hypothesize that the reason why objects like \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY6-bfT4nMY\">Sedna</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v507/n7493/full/nature13156.html\">2012 VP113</a> have their present orbits is because they were \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...643L.135G\">gravitationally scattered there</a> by a much larger object -- \npossibly a very distant undiscovered planet.",
