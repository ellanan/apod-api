  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are these strange little spheres on Mars?\n\nThe robotic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover\">rover Opportunity</a> chanced across \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-290\">these unusually shaped beads</a> earlier this month while exploring a place named \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16128\">Kirkwood</a> near the rim of Mars' \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_(crater)\">Endeavour Crater</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16139\">above image</a> taken by Opportunity's \n<a href=\"http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_instru_mi.html\">Microscopic Imager</a> shows that some ground near the rover is filled with these unusual spheres, each spanning only about 3 millimeters. \n\nAt first glance, the sometimes-fractured balls appear similar to the small rocks dubbed\n<a href=\"ap040405.html\">blueberries</a> seen by Opportunity eight years ago, but these spheres are densely compacted and have little iron content.\n\nAlthough it is thought that\n<a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-09/plucky-mars-rover-opportunitys-newest-jackpot-should-steal-some-curiositys-limelight\">these orbs</a> formed naturally, which natural processes formed them remain unknown.\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4e2FyNFIE\">Opportunity</a>, an older sibling to the recently deployed\n<a href=\"ap120818.html\">Curiosity rover</a>, will continue to study these spheres with the hope that they will provide a new clue to the ancient history of the surface of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">red planet</a>.",
