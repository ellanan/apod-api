  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/126939/0/\">This looks like\na near miss</a> but the greenish coma and tail of\n<a href=\"http://www.livecometdata.com/comets/c2013-a1-siding-spring/\">Comet\nSiding Spring</a> (C/2013 A1) are really\n2,000 light-years or so away from the stars of open cluster\n<a href=\"ap140903.html\">Messier 6</a>.\n\nThey do appear close together though,\nalong the same line-of-sight in this gorgeous October 9th\nskyscape <a href=\"ap141004.html\">toward the constellation\nScorpius</a>.\n\nStill, on Sunday, October 19th this comet really will be involved in\na near miss, passing within only\n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/comets/sidingspring/\">139,500\nkilometers of planet Mars</a>.\n\nThat's about 10 times closer than any known comet flyby of planet Earth,\nand nearly one third the Earth-Moon distance.\n\nWhile an impact with the nucleus is not a threat\nthe comet's dust, moving with a speed of about 56 kilometers per second\nrelative to the Red Planet, and outskirts of its\ngaseous coma could interact with the thin Martian atmosphere.\n\nOf course, the comet's close encounter will be followed\nintently by spacecraft in\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/\n09oct_cometprep/\">Martian orbit and rovers on the surface</a>.",
