  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is there a blue bridge of stars across the center of this galaxy cluster?\n\nFirst and foremost the cluster, designated \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2014/26/index.html\">SDSS J1531+3414</a>, \ncontains many large yellow \n<a href=\"ap100520.html\">elliptical galaxies</a>.\n\nThe cluster's center, as \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/26/image/b/\">pictured above</a> \nby the Hubble Space Telescope, is surrounded by many unusual, thin, \nand curving blue filaments that are actually galaxies far \nin the distance whose images have become magnified and \n<a href=\"ap080210.html\">elongated by the gravitational lens</a> \neffect of the massive cluster.\n\nMore unusual, however, is a \n<a href=\"http://spacetelescope.org/news/heic1414/\">squiggly blue filament</a> \nnear the two large \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxies\">elliptical galaxies</a> \nat the cluster center.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/26/full/\">Close inspection</a> \nof the filament indicates that it is most likely a bridge created by tidal effects\nbetween the two merging central elliptical \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18005\">galaxies</a> \nrather than a background galaxy with an image distorted by \n<a href=\"http://www.cfhtlens.org/public/what-gravitational-lensing\">gravitational lensing</a>. \n\nThe knots in the bridge are \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_instability\">condensation regions</a> that glow blue from the light of massive young stars.\n\nThe central cluster region will likely undergo continued study as its uniqueness makes it an interesting laboratory of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">star formation</a>.",
