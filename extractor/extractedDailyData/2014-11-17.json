  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat do other star systems look like?\n\nTo help find out, astronomers are carrying out \ndetailed observations of nearby stars in infrared light to see which have \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> disks that might be forming planets.\n\nObservations by \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/mission/32-Mission-Overview\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/overview\">Herschel Space Observatory</a> \nhave found that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_95086_b\">planetary system HD 95086</a> \nhas two dust disks: a hot one near the parent star and a cooler one farther out.\n\nAn artist's illustration of how the system might appear is \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4368\">featured here</a>, \nincluding hypothetical planets with large rings that orbit between the disks.\n\nThe planets may have created the large gap between the \n<a href=\"ap041019.html\">disks</a> by absorbing and deflecting \n<a href=\"ap990120.html\">dust</a> with their gravity.\n\nHD 95086 is a blue <a href=\"http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_star.html\">star</a> about 60 percent more massive than our Sun \nthat lies about 300 light years from Earth and is visible with binoculars toward the <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Constellations_ecliptic_equirectangular_plot.svg\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_(constellation)\">Carina</a>. \n\nStudying the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014DPS....4620402S\">HD 95086 system</a> \nmay help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of our own \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\">Solar System</a> \nas well as the \n<a href=\"ap100713.html\">Earth</a>.",
