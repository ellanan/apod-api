  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Massachusetts-based firm of Alvan Clark and Sons became famous for\nmaking telescope optics near the end of the last century.\n\nNear the end of this century, major astronomical observatories still boast of\ntelescopes with lenses and mirrors made by them including\n<a href=\"http://www.lowell.edu/visitors/misc/clark.html\">Lowell Observatory's 24 inch</a> diameter refractor,\n<a href=\"http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO26in.html\">the United States Naval Observatory's 26 inch</a> refractor,\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~jkw3x/donation.html\">the McCormick Observatory's 26 inch</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ucolick.org/~mountain/mthamilton/public/history/\">Lick Observatory's 36 inch</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/virtualmuseum/40inch.html\">Yerkes Observatory's 40 inch refractor</a> - the largest\n<a href=\"http://www.msd.org/how1.htm\">refracting telescope</a> in the world.\n\nSmall observatories too can claim such a link to\n<a href=\"http://w3.one.net/~foto/PictureGallery.htm\">telescopic history</a> and many\noffer the general public a chance to \"look through a classic\".\n\nThis gorgeous, completely\n<a href=\"http://www.mdsci.org/media/scope_bar.JPG\">refurbished 8 inch refractor</a> was\noriginally bought from Alvan Clark and Sons in 1927.\n\nOn Thursdays it stargazes from the\n<a href=\"http://www.mdsci.org/obs.htm\">Crosby Ramsey Memorial Observatory</a> dome atop the Maryland\nScience Center near Baltimore's Inner Harbor.",
