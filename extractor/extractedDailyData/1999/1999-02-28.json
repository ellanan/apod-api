  "explanation": "<b>  </b>  \nSometimes the unexpected comes in a familiar\nshape.  In <a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~johnston/orion/pr.html\">this picture</a>, the seemingly familiar \nteardrop-shaped object just right of center is actually \n<a href=\"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~johnston/orion.html\">an unusually situated disk of gas and dust</a>.\n \nIn fact, the teardrop is about the size of \n<a href=\"ap980517.html\">our own Solar System</a>\nand is racing against time to condense and form planets. \nThis disk, however, is unfortunate enough to lie in the \n<a href=\"ap971118.html\">Trapezium</a>, which is also home to \n<a href=\"http://www.apogee-ccd.com/trapez.html\">several immense, bright stars</a>.\n\nThese bright stars emit light so powerful it boils away the \n<a href=\"http://snoopy.gsfc.nasa.gov/~orfeus2/thermo.html\">gas</a> and <a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> in \n<a href=\"ap961017.html\">planet-forming disks</a>.\n\nLarge <a href=\"ap960131.html\">Jupiter-like planets</a> \nwill probably never form in this hostile environment, \nbut it is currently unknown whether \n<a href=\"ap990131.html\">Earth</a>-like \nplanets could form and survive.",
