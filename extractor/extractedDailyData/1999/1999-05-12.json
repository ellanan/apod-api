  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow did spiral galaxy ESO510-13 get bent out-of-shape?  \n\nThe disks of many \n<a href=\"ap970726.html\">spirals</a> are \n<a href=\"ap981220.html\">thin and flat</a>, but not solid.  \n\nSpiral disks are loose conglomerations of \nbillions of stars and diffuse gas all \ngravitationally orbiting a galaxy center.  \n\nA <a href=\"ap980318.html\">flat disk</a> \nis thought to be created by sticky collisions \nof large gas clouds early in the \n<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/TheWorks1.html\">galaxy's formation</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/Journals/processfree2.asp?contentid=mnr.1998.20&amp;filetype=abstracts&amp;article=1385\">Warped disks</a> are not uncommon, though, and even our own \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> is \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1994AAS...185.2209H\">thought to have a small warp</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://deneb.ugr.es/papers/watico/node3.html\">causes of spiral warps</a> are still being investigated, \nbut some warps are thought to result \nfrom interactions or even \n<a href=\"ap980216.html\">collisions</a> between galaxies.  \n\nESO510-13, \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/phot-20-99.html\">pictured above</a>, \nis about 150 million light years away and \nabout 100,000 light years across.",
