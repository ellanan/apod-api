  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nLike a <a href=\"http://www.aa6g.org/lepidoptera.html\">butterfly</a>, a <a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf star</a> begins its life\nby casting off a cocoon that enclosed its former self.  \n\nIn this analogy, however, the <a href=\"ap980830.html\">Sun</a> would be a <a href=\"http://www.basecamp.com/example_caterpillar.html\">caterpillar</a> and the ejected shell of gas \nwould become the prettiest of all!\n\nThe above cocoon, the <a href=\"ap961121.html\">planetary nebula</a>\ndesignated NGC 2440, <a href=\"ap951130.html\">contains one of the hottest white dwarf stars known</a>.\n The white dwarf can be seen as the bright dot near the photo's\ncenter.  <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/interv.html\">Our Sun will eventually become a \"white dwarf butterfly\"</a>,\nbut not for another 5 billion years.
