  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn September 24, 1997 a\n<a href=\"ftp://eitv3.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/outgoing/PAPERS/\nMORETON/Moreton_Wave.html\">shock wave blasted across</a>\nthe surface of the sun at speeds of 250 to 600 kilometers <i>per second</i>.\n\nOn planet Earth, observer Barry Reynolds photographed the expanding\nshock front (left) in the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/absorption.html\">light emitted by hydrogen atoms</a>\nat the solar surface.\n\nHis discovery image was nicely confirmed by a space-based extreme\nultraviolet image (right) of the shock ramming through the\n<a href=\"http://www.sunblock99.org.uk/\">sun's upper atmosphere</a>\nas recorded by the SOHO satellite observatory.\n\nIn both pictures a bright\n<a href=\"ap980601.html\">solar flare</a> is seen near the center\nof a circular arc-like feature representing a shock front.\n\nThe shock front is dark in the ground based photo and\nbright in the ultraviolet image.\n\nThese shock fronts are believed to be tracers of a 3-dimensional disturbance\ncaused by the flare but researchers are uncertain as to the exact\nphysical mechanisms which produced it.\n\nAlong with other violent events called coronal mass ejections,\nsolar flares are known to\n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/outreach/cmeposter/\">generate streams of energetic particles</a>\nwhich can affect the Earth's magnetosphere and\nEarth orbiting satellites.",
