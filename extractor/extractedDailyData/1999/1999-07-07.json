  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf our Sun were part of M80, the \n<a href=\"ap980226.html\">night sky</a> would glow like a \n<a href=\"ap961111.html\">jewel box</a> of bright stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m080.html\">M80</a>, also known as NGC 6093, is one of about 250 \n<a href=\"http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/research/gcs.html\">globular clusters</a> that survive in our Galaxy.  \n\nMost of the stars in \n<a href=\"http://crux.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/m80v.html\">M80</a> are older and redder than our \n<a href=\"ap980830.html\">Sun</a>, \nbut some enigmatic stars appear to be bluer and younger.  \n\nYoung stars would contradict the hypothesis that \nall the stars in \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....116.2415A\">M80</a> formed at nearly the same time.  \n\nThese unusual stars are known as \n<a href=\"ap971104.html\">blue stragglers</a>, and by analyzing pictures like the \n<a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/26/index.html\">image above</a>, astronomers have been \nable to find the largest population of \n<a href=\"http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~danforth/bss/bss1.html\">blue stragglers</a> yet.  \n\nAs \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997A%26A...324..915F\">blue stragglers</a> are now thought to be due to stars \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....115.2539O\">coalescing</a>, the collision and capture rate at the \ndense center of M80 must be very high.",
