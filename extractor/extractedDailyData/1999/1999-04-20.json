  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created these huge explosion remnants?\nSpeculation has been building recently that \noutbursts even more powerful than well-known \n<a href=\"ap961114.html\">supernovae</a> might occur.  \n\nDubbed \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999ApJ...512L.117H\">hypernovae</a>, these explosions might result \nfrom high-mass stars and liberate perhaps \nten times more energy than conventional \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernovae</a>.  A \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9712123\">hypernova</a> was originally postulated to \nexplain the great amount of energy seemingly liberated in a \n<a href=\"ap970513.html\">gamma-ray burst</a>.  \n\nA \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9903246\">search</a> for visible remnants of hypernovae \nhas now yielded the \n<a href=\"FTP://PAO.GSFC.NASA.GOV/newsmedia/HEAD/HN/hypernova.html\">above two candidates</a>.  \n\nNearby spiral galaxy \n<a href=\"ap970805.html\">M101</a>, shown on the right, \nhas two large expanding shells that might have originated from a hypernova.  Remnant NGC 5471B on the \n<a href=\"FTP://PAO.GSFC.NASA.GOV/newsmedia/HEAD/HN/hypernova.jpg\">upper left</a> and MF83 below were identified \nby the unusually high amount of <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">X-ray radiation</a> they emit.  \n\nMF83 is also one of the largest \n<a href=\"ap990307.html\">expanding shells</a> ever found.  \nResearch continues into the possible nature and \nvisibility of hypernovae and the gas shells \nthey likely leave behind.",
