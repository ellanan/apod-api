  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nEta Carinae is the one of the most luminous star systems in \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">our Galaxy</a>, \nradiating millions of times more power than \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">our Sun</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap980816.html\">Eta Carinae</a> is also \none of the <a href=\"ap970721.html\">strangest star systems</a> known, \n<a href=\"http://ast1.spa.umn.edu/bish/ETACAR/whatsnew.html\">brightening and fading</a> greatly since the early 1800s.   \n\nRecently, the \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/axaf_mission.html\">Chandra Observatory</a> observed \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/captions/0099.html\">Eta Carinae</a> in \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/history1_xray.html\">X-ray light</a>, adding even more \nunanticipated pieces to this enigmatic puzzle.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/photos/1999/photos99-262.htm\">Pictured above</a>, a horseshoe-shaped outer ring about two \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> across has been \n\n<a href=\"http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/releases/1999/99-262.html\">discovered</a> surrounding a hot core \nmeasuring three light-months across.  \n\nOne thing appears likely: these structures were caused by \ncollisions involving matter expelled from the center at <a href=\"http://evlweb.eecs.uic.edu/EVL/SHOWCASE/science/norman/gasjet.html\">supersonic</a> speeds.  \n\nSpeculation continues that \n<a href=\"ap990719.html\">Eta Carinae</a> will be seen to undergo a \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a> explosion sometime in the next thousand years.",
