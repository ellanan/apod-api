  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt may look like a butterfly, but it's bigger than our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/99oct7/ngc2346/ngc2346table.html\">NGC 2346</a> is a \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebula</a> made of gas and \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> \nthat has evolved into a \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/AAO/local/www/dfm/aat079.html\">familiar shape</a>.  \n\nAt the heart of the \n<a href=\"ap990321.html\">bipolar planetary nebula</a> \nis a pair of close stars orbiting each other \nonce every sixteen days.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1985ApJ...297..245S\">tale</a> of how the butterfly blossomed probably \nbegan millions of years ago, when the stars were farther apart.  \n\nThe more massive star expanded to encompass its \n<a href=\"ap951226.html\">binary</a> companion, \ncausing the two to spiral closer and expel \n<a href=\"ap990107.html\">rings</a> of gas.  \n\nLater, bubbles of hot gas emerged as the core of the massive \n<a href=\"http://plabpc.csustan.edu/astro/stars/giant.htm\">red giant star</a> became uncovered.  \n\nIn billions of years, our Sun will become a \n<a href=\"ap990312.html\">red giant</a> and emit a \n<a href=\"http://www.blackskies.com/index1.html\">planetary nebula</a> - but probably not in the shape of a \n<a href=\"http://www.si.edu/resource/tours/gardens/butterfly/start.htm\">butterfly</a>, because the \n<a href=\" http://msgc.engin.umich.edu/cgi-bin/tour.cgi?link=/sun/sun.html\">Sun</a> has no binary star companion.",
