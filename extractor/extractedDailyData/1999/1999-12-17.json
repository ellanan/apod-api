  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe Hydra A galaxy cluster is really big.\n\nIn fact, such\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/galaxy_clusters.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>\nare the largest gravitationally\nbound objects in the Universe.\n\nBut\n<a href=\"ap980831.html\">individual galaxies</a> are too cool to be recorded\nin this false-color\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/0087/index.html\">Chandra Observatory X-ray image</a> which\nshows only the 40 million degree gas\nthat permeates the Hydra A cluster.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that such\n<a href=\"ap991125.html\">X-ray hot gas clouds</a>,\nmillions of light-years across, are common\n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters.html\">in galaxy clusters</a>.\n\nThey\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9911021\">expected the gas</a>\nto be cooling and smoothly flowing into the clusters' central regions\nto form new galaxies and stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/press_120999.html\">Instead, the Chandra image shows</a>\ndetails around the X-ray bright cluster core\nwhich suggest that magnetic fields and explosive\nevents disturb the flow, deflecting the gas\ninto loops and long structures and possibly inhibiting the\nformation of more cluster galaxies and stars.",
