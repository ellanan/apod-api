  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nM83 is a bright <a href=\"ap970805.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nthat can be found with a small telescope in the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Hydra.html\">Hydra</a>. \n\nIt takes light about 15 million years to reach us from \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m083.html\">M83</a>. \n\nM83 is quite a typical spiral - much like our own \n<a href=\"ap971229.html \">Milky Way</a>\nGalaxy.  <a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">Spiral galaxies</a> contains\nmany billions of stars, the youngest of which inhabit the spiral\narms and glow strongly in blue light.  \n\nDark <a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a>\nlanes are mixed in with the stars and help define \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/dfm/aat008.html\">M83</a>'s\nmarked spiral structure. \n\nThe space between the spiral arms is\nalso filled with stars - but stars that are typically more dim\nand red.\n\nThe stars and gas in spiral arms seem to be responding to \nmuch more mass than is visible here, \nimplying that galaxies are predominantly \ncomposed of some sort of <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/matter.html\">dark matter</a>.  Finding the nature of this <a href=\"http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~dursi/dm-tutorial/dm1.html\">dark matter</a> remains one of the great challenges of \nmodern science.",
