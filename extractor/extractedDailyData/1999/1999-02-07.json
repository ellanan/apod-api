  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe largest moon of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> is a rare wonder. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html\">Titan</a> is the only one of Saturn's moons\nwith an atmosphere, and one of only two moons in the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html\">Solar System</a> with this distinction \n(Neptune's \n<a href=\"ap971123.html\">Triton</a> is the other). \n\nTitan's thick cloudy atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, \nlike Earth's, but contains much\nhigher percentages of \"smog-like\" chemicals \nsuch as methane and ethane. The smog may be so thick\nthat it actually rains \"gasoline-like\" liquids. \n\nThe organic nature of some of the chemicals found in \n<a href=\"ap951021.html\">Titan</a>'s\natmosphere cause some to speculate that \nTitan may harbor life! \n\nBecause of its thick cloud cover,\nhowever, Titan's actual surface properties remain mysterious. \n\nVoyager 1 flew by in 1980 taking the\nabove picture, and more recently much has been learned from \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/94/55.html\">observations</a> by the\n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/\">Cassini mission</a> \nlaunched in 1997 will map Titan's surface in 2004, helping to solve some\nof its mysteries.",
