  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mimas.html\">Mimas</a> is one of the smaller moons of \n<a href=\"ap970921.html\">Saturn</a> but shows one of the \nlargest impact craters.\n\nIn fact, if the impact had been much greater, it would have\ndisrupted the entire \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/mimas.html\">satellite</a>.  \n\nThe large crater has been named Herschel\nafter the 1789 discoverer of Mimas, \n<a href=\"http://star.arm.ac.uk/history/herschel.html\">Sir \nWilliam Herschel</a>. Mimas' low mass produces a\nsurface gravity just strong enough to create a spherical body but\nweak enough to allow such relatively large surface features.  \n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/mimas.htm\">Mimas</a> is made of mostly water ice with a \nsmattering of rock - so it is accurately\ndescribed as a big dirty snowball. \n\n<a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html\">Voyager</a> 1 \nflew by in 1980 and took the <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/saturn/mimas.jpg\">above picture</a>.",
