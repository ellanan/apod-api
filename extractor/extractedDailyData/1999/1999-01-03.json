  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/b33x.html\">Horsehead Nebula</a>\nis one of the most famous nebulae on the sky.  It is visible\nas the black indentation to the red <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#emis_neb\">emission nebula</a>\nseen just to the right of center of the above photograph. The\nbright star near the center is located in the belt of the familiar\nconstellation of <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html\">Orion</a>.\nThe horse-head feature is dark because it is really an opaque\n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dust</a> cloud which lies in\nfront of the bright red <a href=\"lib/emission.html\">emission nebula</a>.\nLike clouds in <a href=\"http://www.aspire.cs.uah.edu/~jonesj/r.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>,\nthis cosmic cloud has assumed a recognizable shape by chance.\nAfter many thousands of years, the internal motions of the cloud\nwill alter its appearance. The emission <a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/textbook/ism.html\">nebula</a>'s\nred color is caused by electrons recombining with protons to form\n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">hydrogen</a> atoms. Also\nvisible in the picture are blue <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#refl_neb\">reflection nebulae</a>,\nwhich preferentially \n<a href=\"ap971018.html\">reflect the blue light</a> from nearby stars.",
