  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA bright nova was discovered Saturday that is \ncurrently visible to the unaided eye in southern skies.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/07100/07176.html\">Nova Velorum 1999</a> was recorded near visual magnitude 3 \nindependently by discoverers Peter Williams and \nAlan C. Gilmore (<a href=\"http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/research/astronomy/astronomy_mjuo_facilities.html\">Mt. John U. Obs.</a>), \nmaking it more luminous than many famous bright stars.   \n\nThe last nova this bright was \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1976PASJ...28..163K\">Nova Cygni 1975</a>, which peaked just brighter than \nmagnitude 2.  \n\nNova <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Vela.html\">Velorum</a> 1999 is brighter now than the well-studied \n<a href=\"ap951227.html\">Nova Cygni 1992</a> ever \n<a href=\"ap961216.html\">appeared</a>.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/0398cosmos/0398starrfield.html\">nova</a> occurs when the surface of a \n<a href=\"ap971102.html\">white dwarf star</a> \nundergoes a tremendous \n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/\">thermonuclear</a> explosion, throwing off its outer layers.\n\nHow the nova will appear over the next few weeks is uncertain, \nbut the exploding debris will likely fade beyond detectability \nover the next few years. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.ozemail.com.au/~loomberah/novavel.htm\">above photograph</a> of Nova Velorum 1999 was \ntaken yesterday from Australia.  The \n<a href=\"ap971119.html\">cross-hair like spikes</a> \nthat appear around it were caused by the \nphotographing telescope and camera.",
