  "title": "Zodiacal Light",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the sky itself seems to glow.  \nUsually, this means you are seeing a <a href=\"http://www.athena.ivv.nasa.gov/curric/weather/graphing/clouds.html\">cloud</a> reflecting \n<a href=\"http://www.personal.u-net.com/~kersland/nlc/nlcfaq.htm\">sunlight</a> or moonlight.  \n\nIf the glow appears as a faint band of light running across the \n<a href=\"ap980523.html\">whole sky</a>, \nyou are probably seeing the combined light \nfrom the billions of stars that compose our \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \nBut if the glow \n<a href=\"ap970825.html\">appears triangular and near the horizon</a>, \nyou might be seeing something called \n<a href=\"http://www.earthsky.com/1996/es960308.html\">zodiacal light</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"HTTP://WWW.AAO.GOV.AU/local/www/dfm/misc_frames.html\">Pictured above</a>, \n<a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/sd_search.taf?f=detail&amp;id=19980918\">zodiacal light</a> is just sunlight reflected by \n<a href=\"ap981121.html\">tiny dust particles</a> orbiting in our \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>.  \nMany of these particles were ejected by \n<a href=\"lib/comets.html\">comets</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/sd_search.taf?f=detail&amp;id=19970306\">Zodiacal light</a> is easiest to see in September and \nOctober just before sunrise from a very dark location.",
