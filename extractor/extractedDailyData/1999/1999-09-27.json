  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe disk of our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> is home to hot nebulae, \ncold dust, and billions of stars.   \n\nThe red nebulae visible in the above contrast-enhanced picture are primarily \n<a href=\"ap980214.html\">emission nebulae</a>, \nglowing clouds of hydrogen gas heated by nearby, bright, young stars.  \n\nThe blue nebulae are primarily \n<a href=\"ap990301.html\">reflection nebulae</a>, \nclouds of gas and fine dust reflecting the light of nearby bright stars.  \n\nPerhaps the most striking, though, are the areas of darkness, \nincluding the <a href=\"ap970621.html\">Pipe Nebula</a> \nvisible on the image top left.  \n\nThese are lanes of thick <a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a>, \nmany times containing relatively cold \n<a href=\"ap990511.html\">molecular clouds</a> of gas. \n\nDust is so plentiful that it obscures the \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Galactic Center</a> in visible light, \nhiding its true direction until discovered \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate20.html\">early this century</a>.  \n\nThe diffuse glow comes from \n<a href=\"ap990621.html\">billions of older, \nfainter stars</a> like our \n<a href=\"http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/leaflets/solar_system/Sun.html\">Sun</a>, which are typically much older than any of the nebulae.  \n\nMost of the mass of our Galaxy remains in a form <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/0398cosmos/0398rubin.html\">currently unknown</a>.",
