  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTycho Brahe was the most meticulous astronomical observer of his time.  \n<a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/People/tycho_brahe.html\">Brahe</a>, who lived between 1546 and 1601, \nset out to solve the day's most pressing astronomical problem: \nto determine whether the \n<a href=\"ap990131.html\">Earth</a> or the \n<a href=\"ap960521.html\">Sun</a> was at the center of the \n<a href=\"ap990505.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nTo do this he and his assistants created the first major astronomical observatory where they devised and used the most accurate \n<a href=\"ap980506.html\">pre-telescopic astronomical instruments</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Brahe.html\">Tycho Brahe</a> thus compiled tables of \nprecise measurements of the positions and \nbrightnesses of planets and stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nada.kth.se/~fred/tycho.html\">Brahe</a> \nnever solved the Solar System problem himself - \nbut left data so impressively accurate his assistant \n<a href=\"ap970913.html\">Johannes Kepler</a> \nwas able to develop definitive laws.  <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Catalog/Files/brahe.html\">Brahe</a> is also remembered for witnessing a supernova in 1572, \nshowing that the Great Comet of 1577 was not an \natmospheric phenomena, and for his <a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Images/Port/brahe2.gif\">metal nose</a>.",
