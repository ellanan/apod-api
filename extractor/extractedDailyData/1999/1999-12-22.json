  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTonight, those blessed with clear skies can enjoy a\n<a href=\"ap990419.html\">glorious full moon</a>,\nthe last full moon of the \"Y1.9K\"s.\n\nIn fact, tonight's moon will be a full-perigee-solstice moon,\nreaching its full phase and perigee (the closest point in\n<a href=\"ap991108.html\">its orbit</a>)\non <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/newgrange/\">the solstice</a>,\nthe first day of <a href=\"ap961221.html\">northern hemisphere winter</a>.\n\nAnticipation of this celestial event has generated\n<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/354/science/\nBig_moon_myth_sweeps_Internet+.shtml\">a flood of e-mail</a> chasing the rumor\nthat the full-perigee-solstice moon will be intensely bright.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/news/pr_991217brightmoon.html\">However, calculations show</a> it will only be a little brighter than usual,\nand certainly not dramatically so.\n\nWhy would it be brighter?\n\nMostly because the moon appears bigger and brighter at perigee.\n\nThe above illustration, based on\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/\nPIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA00405\">Galileo spacecraft images</a>,\nshows the approximate difference in apparent\nsize between a\n<a href=\"http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/phases.html\">full moon</a>\nat perigee (left) and a full moon at apogee,\nthe farthest point in the lunar orbit.\n\nThe Earth and moon are also a few percent closer to the sun\nduring northern winter,\nbut the combined effects will cause tonight's full moon to appear\nonly about 20% brighter than an average full moon.\n\nThat difference is not even likely to be noticeable to\n<a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/moon.html\">the human eye</a>.",
