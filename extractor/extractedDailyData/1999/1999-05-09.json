  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOur universe is a very dusty place.  \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">Dust</a>\nusually shows its presence by blocking out light emitted from\nstars or nebulae behind it, \nsometimes creating the illusion of a\n<a href=\"ap961002.html\">horse's head</a> \nor a <a href=\"ap951109.html\">sombrero hat</a>.\n\nBut nobody really knows what a typical \n<a href=\"ap980318.html\">interstellar dust</a> grain\nlooks like.  By studying how \n<a href=\"ap980116.html\">dust</a> \nabsorbs, emits, and reflects\nlight, astronomers do know that interstellar \n<a href=\"ap980121.html\">dust</a> is much different\nthan the cell and lint based dust found around a typical house.\n\n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/a10695/notes/l08/l08.html\">Interstellar dust</a> grains are <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997A%26A%2E%2E%2E323%2E%2E566L&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">composed mostly</a> of <a href=\"http://www-tech.mit.edu/Chemicool/\">carbon, silicon, and oxygen</a>\nand are usually less than about \n1/1000 of a millimeter across.\n\nRecent work indicates that most <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1989ApJ%2E%2E%2E346L%2E%2E89W&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">dust grains are not spherical</a>.\n\nThe above picture shows the result of a <a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/fractals.html\">fractal adhesion model</a>\nfor dust grains involving random conglomerates \nof spherical compounds of different properties, \nhere artificially highlighted by different colors.",
