  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis enhanced Hubble Space Telescope\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/21/\">image shows in remarkable detail</a>\nthe inner portion of the disk of\n<a href=\"http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/~wsh/press/dustydisks.html\">dust and gas surrounding</a> the star AB Aurigae.\n\nKnots of material, visible here for the first time, may well represent\nan early stage of a process which could result in the formation\n<a href=\"http://www.public.asu.edu/~sciref/exoplnt.htm\">of planets</a> over the next few million years.\n\nAB <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Auriga.html\">Aurigae</a> is a young star\n(2-4 million years old), about 469 light-years distant.\n\nIts swirling\n<a href=\"ap960119.html\">circumstellar disk</a> is large,\nabout 30 times the size of\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/other.html\">our solar system</a>.\n\nAstronomers believe\n<a href=\"http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/astronomy/15349\">planet-making</a> is just beginning in\nAB Aurigae's disk because\nknown disks surrounding younger stars (less than 1 million years old)\ndo not show such clumpy structure,\nwhile disks of slightly older stars\n(aged 8-10 million years) have gaps and\n<a href=\"ap990205.html\">features suggesting</a>\nthat planets have already been formed.\n\nWhy the window pane appearance?\n\nWide black stripes in the picture are caused by occulting bars used\nto block out the overwhelming starlight and the diagonal streaks\nare due to <a href=\"ap971119.html\">diffraction spikes</a>.",
