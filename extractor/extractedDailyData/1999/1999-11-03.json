  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"ap961106.html\">Elliptical galaxies</a> \nare known for their old, red stars.  But is this old \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/elli.html\">elliptical</a> up to new tricks?  \n\nIn recent years, the centers of \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/cgi-bin/tour.cgi?link=/the_universe/Ellipticals.html\">elliptical galaxies</a> \n<a href=\" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....116.2297P\">have been found</a> to emit unexpectedly high amounts of blue and \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.  \n\nMost blue light from \n<a href=\"ap990926.html\">spiral galaxies</a> originates from \n<a href=\" ap981025.html\">massive young hot stars</a>, \nin contrast to the red light from the old cool stars \nthought to compose ellipticals.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/40/pr-photos.html\">above recently released, false-color photograph</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nthe center of nearby dwarf elliptical M32 has actually been \nresolved and does indeed show thousands of bright blue stars.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999AAS...194.0713B\">answer</a> is probably that \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/40/index.html\">these blue stars</a> are also old and glow blue, reaching relatively\nhigh temperatures by the\n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/textbook/se.html\">advanced process</a> of \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/msblues.html\">fusing helium</a>, rather than \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">hydrogen</a>, in their cores.\n\n<a href=\"ap960106.html\">M32</a> appears in many pictures \nas the companion galaxy to the massive \n<a href=\"ap971101.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a> (M31).",
