  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo one knows for sure what caused this \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/software/unknown2.wav\">signal</a>.  The bright colors on the \nblue background indicate that an anomalous signal \nwas received here on Earth by a \n<a href=\"ap960308.html\">radio telescope</a> \ninvolved in a \n<a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/phoenix/contact.html\">Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</a> (SETI).  \n\nA search for these signals is ongoing by \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/otherweb/othrseti.htm\">several groups</a> including volunteer members of the \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/general/faq.htm\">SETI League</a>.  \n\nTime labels the vertical axis of the \n<a href=\"http://www.webcom.com/af9y/radio10.htm\">above plot</a>, and frequency marks the horizontal axis.  \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/photos/hits.htm#Unsworth\">this strong signal</a> was never positively identified, \nastronomers have identified in it many attributes \ncharacteristic of a man-made satellite in low Earth orbit.  \n\nMany \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/photos/hits.htm\">unusual signals</a> from space remain unidentified.  \n\nNo <a href=\"ap980917.html\">signal</a> has yet been \nstrong enough or run long enough to be unambiguously \n<a href=\"http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/\">identified</a> as originating from an \nextraterrestrial intelligence.",
