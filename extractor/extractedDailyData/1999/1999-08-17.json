  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNormally, the Moon shows phases, but the Sun does not.  \n\nThe reason is founded in the fact that the \n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/moon_ap_per.html\">Moon</a> shines only by reflected sunlight.  \n\nWhen the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/psc/fullmoons.html\">Moon</a> is closer to the <a href=\"http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/leaflets/solar_system/Sun.html\">Sun</a> than the Earth, \nonly part of it appears to be lit - resulting in a familiar <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/java/MoonPhase.html\">crescent-shaped phase</a>.  \n\nLast Wednesday, however, many \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/eclipses/solar/9908outside_t.html\">viewers in eastern North America</a> \nwere treated to an unusual sunrise where the Sun \nappeared to itself rise in a crescent phase.  \n\nNothing was wrong with Sun - viewers \nwere witnessing the end of a \n<a href=\"ap990810.html\">solar eclipse</a>.   \n\nThis unusual sight was caught \n<a href=\"http://cafe.rapidus.net/tcollin/eclipse.htm\">above</a> during a cloudy morning in \n<a href=\"http://www.gouv.qc.ca/\">Quebec</a>.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF9/960.html\">similar sunrise eclipse recorded almost 3000 years ago</a> \nhas allowed historians to attempt to match \n<a href=\"http://ghs1.greenheart.com/billh/intro.html\">ancient and modern calendars</a>.",
