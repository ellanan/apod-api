  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne of the largest coherent structures \non the sky is known simply as \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1980ApJ...242..533H\">Loop I</a> and can best be seen in \n<a href=\"ap990403.html\">radio</a> and \n<a href=\"ap961008.html\">X-ray</a> maps. \n\nSpanning over 100 degrees, part of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AGM....14..K04B\">Loop I</a> appears so prominent in \nnorthern sky maps that it is known as the \nNorth Polar Spur (NPS).  \n\nLoop I, <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/rosat/snr_loop1.html\">shown above</a> in \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#X-ray\">X-ray light</a>, \nis a thin bubble of gas about 700 light-years across \nwith a center located only about 400 light-years away. \n\nSurprisingly, the cause of this immense structure \nis still debated, but is possibly related to expanding \ngas from a million-year old \n<a href=\"ap981230.html\">supernova</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.msi.umn.edu/Projects/twj/snrmeet/node17.html\">Loop I</a> gas is impacting the nearby \n<a href=\"ap980225.html\">Aquila Rift</a> \n<a href=\"http://dept.physics.upenn.edu/~myers/ASTR001/L25.html\">molecular cloud</a>, \nand may create relatively dense fragments of the local \n<a href=\"http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/a100/handouts/ism.html\">interstellar medium</a>.  \n\nWere our Sun to pass through one of these fragments \nin the next few million years, it \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996AAS...188.4408F\">might affect Earth's climate</a>.",
