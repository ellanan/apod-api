  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere are these gas clouds going so quickly?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/AAO/local/www/dfm/projects/8ba11-putman.html\">High velocity clouds</a> (HVCs) of gas \nhave been seen for decades but their origins and \ndestinations have remained mysterious.  \n\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9907107\">Recent measurements</a> have now placed at least \none of these clouds in the halo of our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, while other measurements \nhave determined the relative abundance of cloud elements.  \n\nOf the two clouds measured, each appears to have a \nchemical abundance consistent with a different origin.  \n\nOne <a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9901029\">HVC</a> has been measured to have very few heavy elements \n(\"low metallically\") compared to neighboring stars, \nwhile another HVC has been inferred to have a \nheavy element abundance more typical of neighboring stars.  \n\nHypotheses are therefore being investigated that \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9911455\">some HVCs are local gas remnants</a> being \n<a href=\"ap990203.html\">pushed away</a> from our Galaxy by \n<a href=\"http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/leaflets/supernovae/supernovae.html\">supernova explosions</a>, while other \n<a href=\"http://space.com/science/astronomy/galactic_clouds_991123.html\">HVCs</a> are ancient \n<a href=\"ap991003.html\">dwarf galaxy</a> \nremnants falling toward our Galaxy.  \n\nThe latter possibility is particularly \ninteresting as it might help explain how our \nGalaxy can continue to \n<a href=\"ap990502.html\">make stars</a> at the observed rate.\n\nFast moving <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/46/content/prc9946.txt\">HVCs</a> are circled in the <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/46/pr.html\">above false-color mosaic</a>.",
