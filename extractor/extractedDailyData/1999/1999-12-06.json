  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m083.html\">M83</a> is one of the closest and brightest \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/spir.html\">spiral galaxies</a> on the sky.  \n\nVisible with binoculars in the constellation of <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Hydra.html\">Hydra</a>, majestic spiral arms have \nprompted its nickname as the Southern Pinwheel.  \n\nAlthough discovered 250 years ago, \nonly in this century was it appreciated that \n<a href=\"ap990926.html\">M83</a> was \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate20.html\">not a gas cloud</a> but a \n<a href=\"http://www.smv.org/hastings/bsmain.htm\">barred spiral galaxy</a> much like our own \n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nM83, \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/pr-18-99.html\">pictured above</a> in a recently released photograph from a\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/projects/vlt/\">Very Large Telescope</a>, is a prominent member \nof a group of galaxies that includes \n<a href=\"ap990822.html\">Centaurus A</a> and \nNGC 5253, all of which lie about 15 million light years distant.  \n\nTo date, six \n<a href=\"ap981230.html\">supernova explosions</a> \nhave been recorded in M83.  \n\nAn unusual \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....116.2834E\">double circumnuclear ring</a> has recently been discovered \nat the center of \n<a href=\"ap970419.html\">M83</a> and is still being investigated.",
