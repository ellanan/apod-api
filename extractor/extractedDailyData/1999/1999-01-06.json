  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTo some, the outline of the <a href=\"http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/~rdj/pages/cluster.html\">open cluster</a> of stars M6 resembles a butterfly.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m006.html\">M6</a>, also known as NGC 6405, \nspans about 20 light-years and lies about \n2,000 light years distant.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0379.html\">M6</a> can best be seen in a dark sky with binoculars \ntowards the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/a113/constellations/SCO1.HTM\">Scorpius</a>, coving about as much of the sky as the \n<a href=\"ap980107.html\">full moon</a>.  \n\nLike other <a href=\"ap970128.html\">open clusters</a>, M6 is composed predominantly of \n<a href=\"ap981025.html\">young blue stars</a>, \nalthough the brightest star is nearly orange.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1977ApJ...218..105W\">M6</a> is estimated to be about 100 million years old.  \nDetermining the distance to clusters like \nM6 helps astronomers calibrate the <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/specialissues/0398cosmos/0398freedman.html\">distance scale</a> of the universe.",
