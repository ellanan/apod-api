  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFrom beginning to end, different stages of a star's life appear in\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/20/index.html\">this exciting Hubble Space Telescope picture</a> of the environs\nof galactic emission nebula\n<a href=\"http://www.ozemail.com.au/~lmacdonald/universe/12970198/3603-df.htm\">NGC 3603</a>.\n\nFor the beginning, eye-catching \"pillars\" of glowing\nhydrogen at the right signal\n<a href=\"ap990502.html\">newborn stars emerging</a>\nfrom their dense, gaseous, nurseries.\n\nLess noticeable,\n<a href=\"ap990511.html\">dark clouds</a>\nor <a href=\"ap951006.html\"> \"Bok globules\" </a>at the top\nright corner are likely part of a still earlier stage, prior to their\ncollapse to form stars.\n\nAt picture center lies a cluster of bright\n<a href=\"ap990507.html\">hot blue stars</a> whose strong\nwinds and ultraviolet radiation have cleared away nearby material.\n\nMassive and young, they will soon exhaust their nuclear fuel.\n\nNearing the end of its life, the bright supergiant\n<a href=\"ap970812.html\">star Sher 25</a> is\nseen above and left of the cluster, surrounded by a glowing ring and flanked\nby ejected blobs of gas.\n\nThe ring structure is reminiscent of\n<a href=\"ap960705.html\">Supernova 1987a</a> and Sher 25\nitself may be only a few thousand years from its\n<a href=\"http://www.ggw.org/asras/snimages\">own devastating finale</a>.\n\nBut what about planets?\n\nCheck out the two\n<a href=\"ap990228.html\">teardrop-shaped</a> objects below the cluster\ntoward the bottom of the picture.\n\nAlthough larger, these emission nebulae are similar to suspected\nproto-planetary disks (proplyds) encompassing stars in the Orion Nebula.",
