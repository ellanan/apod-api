  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Egg Nebula is taking a beating. \nLike a baby chick pecking its \nway out of an egg, the star in the center of the\n<a href=\"ap960129.html\">Egg Nebula</a> \nis casting away shells of gas and \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> \nas it slowly transforms itself into a \n<a href=\"ap980426.html\">white dwarf star</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/11.html\">above picture</a> \nwas taken by the newly installed \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/NICMOS/topnicmos.html\">Near \nInfrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer</a> (NICMOS) now on board the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  \n\nA thick torus of dust now surrounds the star \nthrough which the shell gas is escaping.  \nNewly expelled gas shells escape in beams as can be seen in the \n<a href=\"ap960129.html\">original HST image</a> and in the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/11/background.html\">image shown above</a>.  \n\nThis infrared image is coded in false color to highlight \ntwo different types of emission.  The red light represents \nhot hydrogen gas heated by the collisions of expanding shells.  \n\nThe blue light represents light from the \ncentral star scattered by the \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dust</a> in the nebula.  \n\nIt takes light about 3000 years to reach us from the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1989MNRAS.238P..37P\">Egg Nebula</a>, which is hundreds of times the size of our \n<a href=\"ap980517.html\">Solar System</a>.",
