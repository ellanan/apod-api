  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNGC 6334 is a cloud of gas and dust that \nappears to be forming massive stars.  \nAt 5500 light-years away, the \n<a href=\"http://slime.bu.edu/~kraemer/pics.html\">Bear Claw Nebula</a>, as it has also been dubbed, \nis more than three times as distant as the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n1976x.html\">Orion Nebula</a>, but still close enough for detailed study.  \n\nThe Bear Claw Nebula can be found towards the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/a113/constellations/SCO1.HTM\">Scorpius</a>. \n\nIn visible light, ionized gas makes \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/dfm/uks011.html\">NGC 6334 look quite red</a>.  \n\nThe above false-color photograph, however, was taken in \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">infrared light</a>.  There, the glow of starlight absorbing \n<a href=\"http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~danforth/superfit/superfit.html\">dust</a> is more apparent \n(depicted in blue).  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999ApJ...512..260J\">Current research</a> \nindicates that the bright sources are \nvery young and massive stars.  \n\nThese stars emit light so energetic and intense \nthat it destroys fine grains of \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> in their \nimmediate vicinity, creating an abundance of \n<a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~sgoold/Plasma.html\">ionized gas</a> (depicted in red).",
