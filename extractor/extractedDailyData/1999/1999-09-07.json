  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would you do if it rained blue water from space?   \n\nOn 1998 March 22, no \n<a href=\"http://www.covent-garden.co.uk/Histories/umbrellas.html\">umbrella</a> was needed, as the blue water \ncame attached to a stony \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteorite</a> that landed in \n<a href=\"http://www.texas-on-line.com/graphic/monahans.htm\">Monahans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.state.tx.us/\">Texas</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/meteor.htm\">meteorite</a> fall was seen by several boys, and was being \n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/meetings/LPSC99/pdf/1280.pdf\">carefully scrutinized</a> by NASA scientists within 72 hours.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol285/issue5432/\">scientists discovered</a> an unusual patch of <a href=\"http://www.bushnet.qld.edu.au/schools/mt_st_bernards/enet/eres/rres/salt/salt.htm\">salt crystals</a> on the meteorite's surface, turned blue by \n<a href=\"http://sn-io.jsc.nasa.gov/srag/intro.htm\">radiation</a> in space.  \n\nInside the blue crystals was an even bigger surprise - small droplets of \n<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/OW/\">water</a>.  \nOne of these water droplets is visible near the very center of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/today/meteor.html\">above photograph</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://wwwga.usgs.gov/edu/\">Water</a> is a key factor in \nlife, and this drop of water most likely dates from \n4.5 billion years ago - from the early days of the \n<a href=\"ap990505.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nHow salt and water came to be attached to this \n<a href=\"ap980712.html\">asteroid</a> chip still remains speculative.  \n\nWhat did the boys <a href=\"http://more.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/meteorite990826.html\">do</a> with the meteorite?  First they lent it to \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>.  \nThen they sold it on the Internet.",
