  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens when a \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a> hits the ground?  \nUsually nothing much, as most \n<a href=\"http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/metmis.html\">meteors</a> are small, and indentations they make are soon eroded away.  \n\n49,000 years ago, however, a large meteor created \n<a href=\"http://www.barringercrater.com/\">Barringer Meteor Crater</a> in Arizona, \n<a href=\"http://spaceart.com/solar/cap/earth/meteor.htm\">pictured above</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.meteorite.com/meteor_crater/\">Barringer</a> \nis over a kilometer across.  \nIn 1920, it was the first feature on Earth to be recognized as an \n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/publications/slidesets/impacts.html\">impact crater</a>.  Today, over 100 \n<a href=\"http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/index.html\">terrestrial impact craters</a> have been identified.  \n\n<a href=\"http://ur.rutgers.edu/news/meteor.html\">Recent computer modeling</a> now indicates how some of the \nCanyon Diablo impactor melted during the impact \nthat created Barringer.",
