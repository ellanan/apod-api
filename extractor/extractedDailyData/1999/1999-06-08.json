  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"ap990607.html\">Dust pillars</a> are like \n<a href=\"ap990502.html\">interstellar mountains</a>.  \n\nThey survive because they are more dense than their \nsurroundings, but they are being slowly \n<a href=\"http://www.unink.com/passages/Monument-Valley/Landscapes/MV-Geology.html\">eroded away</a> by a hostile environment.  \n\nVisible in the \n<a href=\"http://eagle.la.asu.edu/hester/trifid.html\">above picture</a> is the end of a \nhuge gas and dust pillar in the \n<a href=\"ap980331.html\">Trifid Nebula</a>, \npunctuated by a smaller pillar pointing up and an unusual \n<a href=\"ap970619.html\">jet</a> pointing to the left.  \nThe pink dots are newly formed low-mass stars.\n\nA star near the small pillar's end is \nslowly being stripped of its accreting gas by \nradiation from a tremendously brighter star \nsituated off the \n<a href=\"http://eagle.la.asu.edu/hester/trifid.html\">above picture</a> to the <a href=\"http://eagle.la.asu.edu/hester/images/m20_ground_anotated.jpg\">upper right</a>.  \n\nThe jet extends nearly a light-year and would \nnot be visible without external illumination.  \n\nAs gas and \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> evaporate from the pillars, \nthe hidden stellar source of this \n<a href=\" ap990211.html\">jet</a> will likely be uncovered, \npossibly over the next 20,000 years.",
