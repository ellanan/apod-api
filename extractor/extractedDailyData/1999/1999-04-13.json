  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWould you notice a second Moon in the sky?  \n\nAbout 700 years ago, light from a \n<a href=\"ftp://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/pao/releases/1999/99-037.htm\">tremendous explosion</a> reached Earth \nthat should have appeared almost \nas bright as a full Moon.  \n\nThe bright spot should have lasted for weeks, \nyet no notation of such an occurrence \nhas been found in historical records.  \n\nThe mystery was uncovered by \n<a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/chen/CV.html\">Wan Chen</a> and <a href=\"http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/gehrels/ShtBio/gehrels.html\">Neil Gehrels</a> \n(<a href=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/GSFC_homepage.html\">NASA/GSFC</a>) when studying the source of \n<a href=\"http://nucleardata.nuclear.lu.se/nucleardata/\">radioactive elements</a> toward the \n<a href=\"ap960612.html\">Vela supernova remnant</a>.\n  \nThey deduced that an explosion \nmuch younger and closer than the \n<a href=\"ap990209.html\">supernova</a> that caused \nVela must have occurred, and even computed \nexplosion characteristics from the amounts of \n<a href=\"ap960724.html\">radioactive elements</a> present. \n\nThey calculate that GRO/RX J0852 should \nhave dazzled \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/astoria.html\">medieval stargazers</a>.  \nPerhaps people were too busy, \nsurviving records are too incomplete, \nor the explosion was somehow too dim.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"ftp://PAO.GSFC.NASA.GOV/newsmedia/HEAD/SN/gammaray.jpg\">above picture</a> of GRO/RX J0852 was taken in \n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/outreach/bro/bro2.html\">gamma-ray light</a> with the \n<a href=\"ap950811.html\">Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory</a> \nand is shown in false-color.\n\nAstronomers and historians continue to contemplate the clues.",
