  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMars may be a\n<a href=\"ap970627.html\">cold, dry planet</a>\nbut its weather is dynamic.\n\nOn June 30, wide angle cameras on board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)\nspacecraft watched the development of\n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars/global_surveyor/camera/\nimages/8_10_99_releases/moc2_172/index.html\">this large scale storm system</a>\nabove Mars' north polar area.\n\nThese frames were recorded on successive\n<a href=\"http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/SiteCat/sitecat2/MGS/map.htm\">mapping orbits</a> at intervals of\nabout 2 hours, with the white\n<a href=\"http://ltpwww.gsfc.nasa.gov/tharsis/agu_f98.html\">north polar cap</a> near the center of each.\n\nHigh winds seem to mix the brownish dust clouds and white water-ice\nclouds as the curling storm front churns over the extreme northern\nmartain landscape.\n\nThe MGS cameras have watched similar storms in this region during the\nmonths of July and August revealing\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/mgsnewpix.html\">surprisingly</a> complex weather.\n\n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/orbiter/now.html\">Mars Climate Orbiter</a> will join the MGS spacecraft in martian orbit in late\nSeptember, and in December\n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/lander/now.html\">Mars Polar Lander</a> is scheduled to touch\ndown near the Red Planet's south pole.",
