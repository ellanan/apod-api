  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLaunched in 1990, the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/rosat.html\">ROSAT observatory</a> explored the Universe by\nviewing the entire\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory1_xray.html\">sky in x-rays</a> -- photons with about\n1,000 times more energy than visible light.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/survey/sxrb/12/ass.html\">ROSAT survey </a> produced the sharpest, most sensitive\nimage of the x-ray sky to date.\n\nThe all-sky image is shown with the plane of\n<a href=\"ap980523.html\">our Milky Way Galaxy</a> running\nhorizontally through the center.\n\nBoth x-ray brightness and relative energy\nare represented with red, green, and blue colors indicating three\nx-ray energy ranges (from lowest to highest).\n\nBright x-ray spots near the galactic plane are within our own Milky Way.\n\nThe brightest region (right of center) is toward the\n<a href=\"ap000609.html\">Vela Pulsar</a> and the Puppis\n<a href=\"ap991209.html\">supernova remnant</a>.\n\nBright sources beyond our Galaxy are also apparent, notably the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/virgo.html\">Virgo cluster\nof galaxies</a> (near top right) and\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/lmc.html\">the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a>.\n\nThe LMC is easy to find here as\nseveral of the black stripes (blank areas caused by missing data) seem\nto converge on its position (lower right).\n\nOver large areas of the sky a general diffuse\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/00_releases/\npress_011400bg.html\">background of x-rays</a> dominates. \n\nHot gas in our own Galaxy provides\nmuch of this background and gives rise to the grand\n<a href=\"ap990503.html\">looping structures</a>\nvisible in the direction of the galactic center (image center).\nUnresolved extragalactic sources also add to this background, particularly\nabove and below the plane.\n\nDespite the x-ray sky's exotic appearance,\na very familiar feature is visible -\nthe gas and dust clouds which line the plane of our galaxy\nabsorb x-rays as well\nas optical light and produce the dark bands running\n<a href=\"ap000629.html\">through the galactic center</a>.",
