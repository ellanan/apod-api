  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNew evidence bolsters once controversial claims that \n<a href=\"ap961123.html\">Gamma-Ray Bursts</a> (GRBs) are \nthe most powerful explosions ever found by humanity.  \nTwo weeks ago, an \n<a href=\"ap970513.html\">average GRB became instantly historic</a> \nwhen prompt, coincident \n<a href=\"http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">X-ray</a> and optical emissions were identified.  \nThe glow in visible light \nwas particularly interesting because it showed color\ngaps indicative of absorbing gas at the \n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/~george/press_release.text\">very distant \nredshift</a> of  0.8.  If \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/jbonnell/www/grbhist.html\">GRBs</a> \ndo occur this far into our universe, then \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1993ApJ%2E%2E%2E418L%2E%2E%2E5P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">radio emission was predicted to peak about a week after \nthe optical emission</a>.  Now, late reports do indicate that \nradio emission has been detected and does \npeak a week later than the optical.  This adds credibility to the claim that these\nbursts of gamma-radiation indeed \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1995.html\">occur far from our familiar home Galaxy</a>.\n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/~george/grb.html\">Shown above</a> \nare two photos highlighting the changing optical emission from \nGRB970508 when it was increasing in brightness.  \nNow light from this enigmatic explosion is fading.",
