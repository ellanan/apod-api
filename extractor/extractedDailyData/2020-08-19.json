  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Sun change as it rotates?\n\nYes, and the changes can vary from subtle to dramatic.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WRgXvdasm0\">featured time-lapse sequences</a>, \nour Sun -- as imaged by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> -- \nis shown rotating though an entire month in 2014. \n\nIn the large image on the left, the solar \n<a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml\">chromosphere</a> is depicted in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet</a> light, while the smaller and lighter \nimage to its upper right simultaneously shows the more familiar solar \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/surface.shtml\">photosphere</a> in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible light</a>.\n\nThe rest of the inset six Sun images highlight \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">X-ray emission</a> \nby relatively rare iron atoms located at different heights of the \n<a href=\"ap170920.html\">corona</a>, all \n<a href=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1B33/production/_105436960_blue1.jpg\">false-colored</a> \nto accentuate differences.\n\nThe Sun takes just under a month to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation\">rotate</a> \ncompletely -- rotating fastest at the equator.\n\nA large and active \n<a href=\"ap031027.html\">sunspot region</a> rotates into view soon after the video starts. \n\nSubtle effects include changes in \n<a href=\"ap111106.html\">surface texture</a> and the shapes of active regions.\n\nDramatic effects include numerous flashes in active regions, and fluttering and \n<a href=\"ap190526.html\">erupting prominence</a>s visible all around the Sun's edge. \n\nPresently, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">our Sun</a> \nis passing an unusually low  \n<a href=\"ap191028.html\">Solar minimum</a> in activity of its \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/solar-events-news/Does-the-Solar-Cycle-Affect-Earths-Climate.html\">11-year magnetic cycle</a>.\n\nAs the video ends, the same large and \n<a href=\"ap141022.html\">active sunspot region</a> \npreviously mentioned rotates back into view, this time \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\">looking different</a>.",
