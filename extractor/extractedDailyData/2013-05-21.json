  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow was the unusual Red Rectangle nebula created?\n\nAt the nebula's center is an aging \n<a href=\"ap991219.html\">binary star system</a>\nthat surely powers the nebula but does not, as yet, explain its colors.\n\nThe unusual shape of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_rectangle\">Red Rectangle</a> \nis likely due to a thick dust torus which pinches the otherwise spherical\n<a href=\"ap070811.html\">outflow</a> into tip-touching\n<a href=\"ap070416.html\">cone shapes</a>.\n\nBecause we view the torus edge-on, the boundary edges of the\n<a href=\"http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/cone.html\">cone shape</a>s\nseem to form an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X\">X</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...740...27K\">distinct rungs</a> suggest the outflow occurs in fits and starts.\n\nThe unusual colors of the nebula are\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Ap%26SS.323..337G\">less well understood</a>, however, and \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...693.1946W\">speculation</a> holds that they are partly provided by\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon\">hydrocarbon molecules</a> that may actually be\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/interview/1992/the-aromatic-world\">building blocks</a> for organic life.\n\nThe Red Rectangle nebula lies about 2,300 light years away\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lJGzueLRQY\">towards</a>\nthe constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros).\n\nThe nebula is <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1007a/\">shown above in great detail</a> as \n<a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/full/42115/0/?mod=none&amp;real=\">recently reprocessed</a> \nimage from <a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nIn a few million years, as one of the central stars becomes\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution\">further depleted</a> of nuclear fuel, the Red Rectangle nebula will likely bloom into a\n<a href=\"planetary_nebulae.html\">planetary nebula</a>.",
