  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~yan/57p.html\">Comet 57P\nhas fallen to pieces</a>, at least 19 of them.\n\nOrbiting the Sun every 6 years or so\n<a href=\"http://www.cometography.com/pcomets/057p.html\">this\nfaint comet</a> - also\nchristened Comet 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte for its three\n1941 co-discoverers - is simply 57th on the\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\ncometfact.html\">list of comets</a> known to be periodic,\nbeginning with\n<a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/artsednet/resources/Space/Stories/\nhalleys.html\">Comet 1P/Halley</a>.\n\nIn mid July, responding\n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~yan/57piaucs.html\">to\nreports of</a> a new object possibly associated\nwith <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#57P\">Comet 57P</a>,\nastronomers were able to\nconstruct this mosaic of deep sky images identifying a surprising\n19 fragments (circled)\n<a href=\"ap020525.html\">strung out</a> behind the\n<a href=\"http://www.thursdaysclassroom.com/19sep01/\nteach4.html\">cometary</a> coma and nucleus itself (far left).\n\nThe full mosaic spans about a million kilometers at the\ndistance of the comet,\nwhile the individual pieces detected are probably a few tens to\na few hundred meters across.\n\nStress produced as sunlight warmed the icy, rocky nucleus\nlikely contributed to the\n<a href=\"ap000811.html\">fragmentation</a>.\n\nIn fact, when last seen passing through the inner solar system in\n1996, Comet 57P brightened unexpectedly, indicating a sudden increase\nin <a href=\"ap000805.html\">surface activity</a>.",
