  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those bright objects in the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/02nov_venusjupiter.htm\">morning sky</a>?  \n\nEarly morning <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/pets/dogs.shtml\">dog</a> walkers, among many others across our world's Northern Hemisphere, \nhave likely noticed tremendously bright \n<a href=\"venus.html\">Venus</a> hanging in the \neastern sky just before sunrise.  \n\nLooking a bit like an approaching airplane, \nVenus holds its place in the sky and never seems to land.  \n\nLast week, impressive but less bright \n<a href=\"ap031114.html\">Jupiter</a> appeared within a degree of the \n<a href=\"ap040521.html\">Venusian orb</a>, creating a \n<a href=\"ap020429.html\">dazzling sky</a> that you might appreciate a bit more than your dog.  \n\nThis <a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance/article_110_1.asp\">night sky early show</a> will \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/041105_morning_planets.html\">change slightly over the next week</a>, with the \n<a href=\"http://www.earthsky.org/skywatching/tsky.php?t=20041103\">planets</a> moving past each other, \nMars moving into the picture, guest stars like \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/spica.html\">Spica</a> appearing to shift in the background, and even a <a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/planets/article_1364_1.asp\">crescent Moon</a> stopping in for a cameo.  \n\nPictured above last week, Jupiter and Venus were photographed rising before the Sun over the city of Bursa, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/tu.html\">Turkey</a>.",
