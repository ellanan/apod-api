  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis rock structure is not only surreal -- it's real. \n\nThe reason it's not more famous is that it is, perhaps, smaller than one might guess: the capstone rock overhangs only a \n<a href=\"https://www.isaczermak.com/gallery/north-america/usa/new-mexico/san-juan-basin/san-juan-basin-king-of-wings-and-steffen.jpg.html\">few meters</a>. \n\nEven so, the \n<a href=\"http://www.lovethesepics.com/2015/08/bizarre-yet-beautiful-badlands-hidden-gems-in-new-mexicos-wilderness-52-pics/\">King of Wings</a> outcrop, located in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico\">New Mexico</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>, is a fascinating example of an unusual type of rock structure called a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)\">hoodoo</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap080703.html\">Hoodoo</a>s may \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)#Formation\">form</a> when a layer of hard rock overlays a layer of \n<a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/erosion/\">eroding</a> \nsofter rock.\n\nFiguring out the details of incorporating \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWu2_X4gRYw\">this hoodoo</a> into a night-sky photoshoot took over a year.\n\nBesides \n<a href=\"http://astoundable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cat-window-waiting.jpg\">waiting for a suitably picturesque night</a> behind a sky with few clouds, \nthe foreground had to be \n<a href=\"ap160630.html\">artificially lit</a> \njust right relative to the natural glow of the background. \n\nAfter much planning and waiting, the final shot, \n<a href=\"http://waynepinkstonphoto.com/WhatsNew/i-Trxjrp7/A\">featured here</a>, \nwas taken in May 2016.\n\nMimicking the horizontal bar, the background sky features the band of our \n<a href=\"https://mwmw.gsfc.nasa.gov/mmw_product.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> stretching overhead.",
