  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nPlanetary nebulae <a href=\"ap040424.html\">can</a> look simple,\nround, and planet-like in small telescopes.\n\nBut images from the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/reference_desk/faq/\ncategory.php.cat=hst\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> have become\nwell known for showing these fluorescent\n<a href=\"ap050311.html\">gas shrouds</a> of dying Sun-like stars to possess a\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\nimage_category/nebula/planetary/\">staggering variety</a>\nof detailed <a href=\"ap040910.html\">symmetries and shapes</a>.\n\nThis composite color Hubble\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/\n2000/12/\">image of NGC 6751</a> is a beautiful example of a\nclassic planetary nebula with complex features.\n\nIt was selected in April of 2000, to commemorate the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/future/\">tenth\nanniversary</a> of Hubble in orbit.\n\nThe colors were chosen to represent the relative temperature of the\ngas - blue, orange, and red indicating the hottest to coolest gas.\n\nWinds and radiation from the intensely hot central\n<a href=\"ap050123.html\">star</a>\n(140,000 <a href=\"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/\nblynds/tmp.html\">degrees</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uu.se/history/Celsius_eng.html\">Celsius</a>)\nhave apparently created the nebula's streamer-like features.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2000/12/fast_facts.html\">The nebula's</a>\nactual diameter is approximately 0.8 light-years\nor about 600 times the size of our solar system.\n\nNGC 6751 is 6,500 light-years distant in the high-flying constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Aquila.html\">Aquila</a>.",
