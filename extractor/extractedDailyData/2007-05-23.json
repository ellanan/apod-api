  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe two brightest objects in the night sky appeared to go right past each other last week.  \n\nOn the night of May 19, \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">Earth's Moon</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap070501.html\">planet Venus</a> were visible in the same part of the sky, \nand at closest approach were less than one degree apart.  \n\nThe conjunction was captured in the above image taken from near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City\">Quebec City</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec\">Quebec</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>.  \n\nVenus appears on the lower left of the above photo.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap010415.html\">spires</a> that appear to emanate from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus\">Venus</a> are \n<a href=\"http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/kaspar/obs_mishaps/images/int_reflection2.html\">diffraction spikes</a> caused by the camera itself.   \n\nThe image is so clear that \n<a href=\"ap060530.html\">craters on the Moon</a> are resolved.  \n\nOf course, the real physical distance between the \ntwo heavenly bodies was not unusually small -- the apparent \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_%28astronomy_and_astrology%29\">conjunction</a> was really just an \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7NGncCgU\">illusion</a> of\n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">perspective</a>.\n\nAlthough Earth's Moon passes Venus once each month, such a \n<a href=\"ap061030.html\">close passing</a> visible in the \n<a href=\"ap020524.html\">evening sky</a> is more rare.",
