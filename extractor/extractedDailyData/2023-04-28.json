  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nLike a ship plowing through cosmic seas, runaway star\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/alphacam.html\">Alpha Camelopardalis</a>\nhas produced this graceful arcing bow wave or bow shock.\n\nThe massive supergiant star moves at over 60\nkilometers per <i>second</i> through space, compressing the\n<a href=\"http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar\nmaterial</a> in its path.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/btpfxw/B/\">At the center</a>\nof this nearly 6 degree wide view, Alpha Cam is about 25-30 times\nas massive as the Sun, 5 times hotter (30,000 kelvins), and\nover 500,000 times brighter.\n\nAbout 4,000 light-years away in the long-necked constellation\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelopardalis\">Camelopardalis</a>,\nthe star also produces a strong stellar wind.\n\nAlpha Cam's bow shock stands off about 10 light-years from the star itself.\n\nWhat set this\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20110310.html\">star in motion</a>?\n\nAstronomers have long thought that Alpha Cam was flung out of\na nearby cluster of young hot stars due to gravitational interactions\nwith other cluster members or perhaps by the\nsupernova explosion of a massive companion star.",
