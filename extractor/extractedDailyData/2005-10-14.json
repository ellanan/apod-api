  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/eclipses/\ngallery_03oct05_page3.htm\">Of course</a>,\neveryone is concerned about what to wear to a\n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">solar eclipse</a>.\n\nNo need to worry though, nature often conspires to project images\nof the eclipse so that stylish and appropriate\n<a href=\"http://acept.la.asu.edu/PiN/rdg/lightpath/\nlightpath.shtml\">patterns adorn</a> many\nvisible surfaces - including clothing - at just the right time.\n\nMost commonly, small gaps between\n<a href=\"ap990813.html\">leaves on trees</a> can act as\n<a href=\"http://www.pinhole.org/make/index.cfm\">pinhole cameras</a>\nand generate multiple recognizable images of\nthe eclipse.\n\nBut while <a href=\"ap051007.html\">in Madrid</a> to view the\nOctober 3rd <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/\nindex.cfm?fobjectid=38074\">annular eclipse</a> of the Sun,\nastronomer Philippe Haake met a friend who had another\ninspiration.\n\nThe result, a grid of small holes in a kitchen strainer\nproduced this pattern of images on an 'eclipse shirt'.",
