  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBright stars, interstellar clouds of dust and glowing nebulae fill\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/l6m1vn/0/?nc=user\">this cosmic scene</a>,\na skyscape just north of <a href=\"ap171123.html\">Orion's belt</a>.\n\nClose to the plane of our\n<a href=\"ap201021.html\">Milky Way</a> Galaxy,\nthe wide field view spans just under 5 degrees or about 10 full moons on\nthe sky.\n\nStriking\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/messier-78\">bluish M78</a>,\na reflection nebula, is at the lower right.\n\nM78's tint is due to dust preferentially reflecting the\nblue light of hot, young stars.\n\nIn colorful contrast, the red swath of glowing hydrogen gas\nstreaming through the center is part of the region's faint but\n<a href=\"ap190821.html\">extensive emission nebula</a>\nknown as Barnard's Loop.\n\nAt upper left, a dark dust cloud forms a prominent silhouette\ncataloged as <a href=\"ap200221.html\">LDN 1622</a>.\n\nWhile M78 and the complex Barnard's Loop are some 1,500 light-years\naway, LDN 1622 is likely to be much closer, only about 500\nlight-years distant from our fair planet Earth.",
