  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nStars remain where they are.  Nebulas appear the same.  Day after day.  Year after year.\n\nGiven the vast distances in astronomy, even fast moving objects will not appear to change their appearance in a\n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html\">human lifetime</a>.  Typically.\n\nA recent spectacular exception to this, however, is the supersonic jet in the star forming\n<a hef=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig�Haro_object\">Herbig Haro</a> 47.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/88557/hubble-movies-star-supersonic-jets/\">HH 47</a> is so close -- and the jets are moving so fast -- that images from the\n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> from 1994 to 2008 have been combined into a time-lapse movie that actually shows a powerful jet expanding.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFB0vgjIHiI\">Visible above</a>, jets of plasma extending over 10,000 times the Earth-Sun distance shoot out from a <a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2011-20-j-compass_large_web.jpg\">forming star</a> at speeds in excess of 150 kilometers per second.\n\nStudying how these\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXPrIiLIAh8\">jets evolve</a> gives clues not only to how the star in <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2011/20/video/b/\">HH 47</a> is forming, but how stars like our Sun formed billions of years ago.\n\n<a href=\"ap951012.html\">HH 47</a> is located about 1,500 light years away toward the constellation of Sails of a Ship\n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(constellation)\">Vela</a>).",
