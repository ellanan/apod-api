  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMeteors have been shooting out from the constellation of Orion.  \n\nThis was expected, as October is the time of year for the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/meteors/orionids\">Orionids Meteor Shower</a>.  \n\nPictured here, over two dozen meteors were caught in successively \nadded exposures last October over \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmBBatgNFb4\">Wulan Hada</a> volcano in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia\">Inner Mongolia</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>.\n\nThe featured image shows \n<a href=\"ap031116.html\">multiple meteor streaks</a> \nthat can all be connected to a single small region on the sky called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(meteor_shower)\">radiant</a>,\nhere visible just above and to the left of the \n<a href=\"ap040304.html\">belt of Orion</a>, \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orionids\">Orionids</a> \nmeteors started as sand sized bits expelled from \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">Comet Halley</a> \nduring one of its trips to the inner \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/solarsystem\">Solar System</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"ap100104.html\">Comet Halley</a> is \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/4e/eb/c64eebbd2ba11d1d42b4ccbab5a94646.jpg\">actually responsible</a> for two \n<a href=\"http://www.amsmeteors.org/showers.html\">known meteor showers</a>, \nthe other known as the \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-eta-aquarid-meteor-shower\">Eta Aquarids</a> and \n<a href=\"ap140509.html\">visible</a> every May.  \n\nAn Orionids image featured on \n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8779599/astronomy-picture-of-the-day-oral-history\">APOD</a> one \n<a href=\"ap171030.html\">year ago today</a> from the same location shows the same car. \n\nNext month, the \n<a href=\"ap151115.html\">Leonids Meteor Shower</a> \nfrom <a href=\"ap021116.html\">Comet Tempel-Tuttle</a> should also result in \nsome bright meteor streaks.",
