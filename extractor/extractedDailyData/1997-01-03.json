  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Wolf-Rayet stars can blow bubbles.  These\nunusual stars are much hotter and more luminous than our <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a>.\n All extremely massive stars will eventually evolve though a Wolf-Rayet\nphase.  <a href=\"http://www.webhead.com/~sergio/hot/wrcat.html\">Approximately 200</a>\n<a href=\"http://ast1.spa.umn.edu/Bubbles/WRAspherical/project.html\">Wolf-Rayet stars</a>\nare known in our <a href=\"ap960213.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996A%26A%2E%2E%2E306%2E%2E771R&amp;db_key=AST\">Wolf-Rayet stars</a>\ngenerate <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995ApJ...455..145G\">bubbles</a>\nbecause they continually eject their outer atmosphere as a stellar\nwind.  This outgoing wind of particles typically carries away\nmore than the mass of our <a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a> each\nyear!  The <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995ApJ...448..858E\">wind is caused by atmospheric particles absorbing outgoing starlight</a>,\nalthough many details of this process are unknown.  The Wolf-Rayet\nis the brightest star in the <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/hotimage/n2359.html\">above picture</a>\nand is in the center of the large bubble in the nebula known as <a href=\"ap970102.html\">NGC 2359</a>.\n<br>",
