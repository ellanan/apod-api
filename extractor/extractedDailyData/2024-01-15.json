  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes, it's the stars that are the hardest to see that are the most interesting.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_348\">IC 348</a> \nis a young star cluster that illuminates surrounding filamentary dust. \n\nThe stringy and winding dust appears pink in \n<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2331a/\">this recently released infrared image</a> from the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/\">Webb Space Telescope</a>.\n\nIn <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/\">visible light</a>, this dust reflects mostly blue light, giving \n<a href=\"ap230112.html\">the surrounding material</a> the familiar blue hue of a reflection nebula. \n\nBesides bright stars, several cool objects have been located in IC 348, visible because they glow brighter in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/\">infrared light</a>. \n\nThese objects are hypothesized to be low mass \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf\">brown dwarfs</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AJ....167...19L/abstract\">Evidence for this</a> includes the detection of an \n<a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/banner-three-pets-atttentive-thinking-600nw-2136132101.jpg\">unidentified</a> atmospheric chemical, likely a hydrocarbon, seen previously in the \n<a href=\"ap110119.html\">atmosphere</a> of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/\">Saturn</a>.\n\nThese objects appear to have masses slightly greater than known planets, \nonly a few times greater than \n<a href=\"ap220828.html\">Jupiter</a>. \n\nTogether, these indicate that this young \n<a href=\"ap230707.html\">star cluster</a> contains something noteworthy -- young planet-mass \n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-makes-brown-dwarfs-unique\">brown dwarfs</a> that float free, not orbiting any other star.",
