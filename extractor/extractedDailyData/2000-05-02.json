  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid you see that flash?  \n\nLasting only about 15 seconds, it's possible \nthat nobody you ask can confirm it, \nbut what you might have seen is \nsunlight reflecting off an orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.iridium.com/\">Iridium</a> satellite.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www2.satellite.eu.org/sat/vsohp/satintro.html\">Satellites</a> of all types have been providing \nstreaks and glints visible only since the launch of \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/sputnik/\">Sputnik I</a> in 1957.  \n\nOf these, \n<a href=\"ap980402.html\">flares from any of the \n66 Iridium satellites</a> can be particularly bright, \nsometimes even approaching the brightness of the \n<a href=\"moon.html\">Moon</a>.  \n\nIf the \n<a href=\"http://www.satellite.eu.org/sat/vsohp/iridium.html\">Iridium satellites</a> are programmed to \nre-enter the Earth's atmosphere, \nthey might provide even brighter flares as they burn up.  \n\nPictured above, the streak from an \nIridium satellite punctuates a picturesque sunset in \n<a href=\"http://www.donsnsn.es/icaste.htm\">San Sebastian</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/sp.html\">Spain</a>. \n\nThen again, that sky-flash you saw?  If it lasted only a \nsecond or two, it might have been a \n<a href=\"ap991202.html\">meteor</a>.",
