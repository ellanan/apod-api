  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn this night scene from the early hours of November 14,\nlight from a last quarter Moon illuminates clouds above the\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/kpno/kpcam/\">mountaintop</a> domes of\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/kpno\">Kitt Peak</a>\nNational Observatory near Tucson, Arizona.\n\nBright Jupiter is just left of the overexposed lunar disk with\na streak of camera lens flare immediately to the right, but that's no\n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/\">fireball meteor\nexploding</a> near the center of the picture.\n\nInstead, from the roadside perspective\na stunningly bright\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parmoon.htm\">moondog\nor paraselene</a> stands directly over\nKitt Peaks's <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/wiyn/index.html\">WIYN\ntelescope</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap110110.html\">Analogous to</a> a sundog or parhelion,\na paraselene is produced by\nmoonlight refracted through thin, hexagonal, plate-shaped ice crystals\nin high cirrus clouds.\n\nAs determined by the crystal\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/dogfm.htm\">geometry</a>,\nparaselenae (plural) are seen at\nan angle of 22 degrees or more from the Moon.\n\nCompared to the bright lunar disk they are more\n<a href=\"ap090611.html\">often faint</a>\nand easier to spot when the Moon is low. \n\nAbout 10 minutes after the photograph\neven this bright moondog had faded from the night.",
