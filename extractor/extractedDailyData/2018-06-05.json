  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow complex is Jupiter?\n\nNASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno/\">Juno mission</a> to Jupiter is finding the Jovian giant to be \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Joupv6f-M\">more complicated than expected</a>.\n\nJupiter's magnetic field has been \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018GeoRL..45.2590C\">discovered to be</a> much different from our <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/images/607968main_geomagnetic-field-orig_full.jpg\">Earth's simple dipole field</a>, showing \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/solar-system/early-science-results-juno-spacecraft-show-whole-new-jupiter/\">several poles embedded in a complicated network</a> more convoluted in the north than the south.\n\nFurther, Juno's radio measurements show that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter\">Jupiter's atmosphere</a> shows structure well below the upper cloud deck -- even hundreds of kilometers deep.\n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a>'s newfound complexity is evident also in southern clouds, as shown in the \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?featured=1&amp;p=2\">featured image</a>. \n\nThere, planet-circling \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/jupiter/jupiters-belts-and-zones.html\">zones and belts</a> that dominate near the equator decay into a \n<a href=\"ap180521.html\">complex miasma</a> of continent-sized storm swirls. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">Juno</a> continues in its looping elliptical orbit, \n<a href=\"ap180226.html\">swooping near the huge planet</a> \nevery 53 days and exploring a slightly different sector each time around.",
