Principally\nbecause of changes caused by the gravitational influence of Jupiter,\nHale-Bopp should pass this way again in a mere 2,380 years.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.halebopp.com/whatare2.htm\">Comets come from</a> the outer reaches of the Solar System where they\nreside, frozen and preserved.\nAstronomers analyzing\n<a href=\"http://http.hq.eso.org/comet-hale-bopp/\ncomet-hale-bopp-summary-mar25-97-rw.html#11\">their structure and composition</a>\nas comets swing near the Sun seek\n<a href=\"http://pdc.jpl.nasa.gov/stardust/home.html\">a glimpse of the conditions during the\nSolar System's formative years</a>.",
