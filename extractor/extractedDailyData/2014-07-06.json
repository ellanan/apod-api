  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis coming Saturday, if it is clear, well placed New Yorkers can \n<a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium/resources/manhattanhenge\">go outside at sunset</a> and watch their city act like a modern version of \n<a href=\"ap990912.html\">Stonehenge</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\">Manhattan</a>'s streets will flood dramatically with \nsunlight just as the Sun sets precisely at each street's western end.\n\nUsually, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_world#Tallest_skyscrapers_in_the_world\">tall buildings</a> \nthat line the gridded streets of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City\">New York City</a>'s tallest borough will hide the setting Sun.  \n\nThis effect makes <a href=\"ap131104.html\">Manhattan</a> \na type of modern \n<a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/h7.html\">Stonehenge</a>, \nalthough only aligned to about 30 \n<a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/trig/angle.html\">degrees</a> east of north.  \n\nWere <a href=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/01/17/the-greatest-grid/\">Manhattan's road grid</a> perfectly aligned to east and west, \ntoday's effect would occur on the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">Vernal</a> and \n\n<a href=\"ap030923.html\">Autumnal Equinox</a>, \nMarch 21 and September 21, the only two days that the \n<a href=\"ap040320.html\">Sun rises and sets due east and west</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/layout/set/plain/content/view/popup/53923/(baseNodeID)/3278\">Pictured above</a> in this horizontally stretched image,\nthe Sun sets down\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Street_(Manhattan)\">34th Street</a> as\nviewed from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Avenue\">Park Avenue</a>.\n\nIf Saturday's sunset is hidden by clouds <a href=\"http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130624220704/animaljam/images/7/7a/Bear-sitting-picnic-table.jpg\">do not despair</a> -- the same thing happens twice each year:  \nin late May and mid July.  \n\nOn none of these occasions, however, should you ever \nlook directly at the Sun.",
