  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would Saturn's rings look like if the ring plane pointed directly at the Sun?\n\nThat situation occurred earlier this month when\n<a href=\"ap080922.html\">equinox</a> occurred on Saturn.  \n\nSince the Earth is nearly in the same direction as the Sun from Saturn, the rings\n<a href=\"ap950801.html\">appeared to disappear</a> from Earth.\n\nFrom the robotic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini�Huygens\">Cassini spacecraft</a>\norbiting Saturn, however, the unusually illuminated ring plane could be viewed from on high.\n\n<a href=\"http://ciclops.org/view/5771/Saturn_Equinox_Raw_Preview_4\">Pictured above</a>, Saturn's rings, darker than ever seen before,\nwere captured just a few hours before\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturntourdates/\">equinox</a> on 2009 August 10.\n\nThe reason for the unusual brightness of an inner ring is currently unknown, but possibly related to\n<a href=\"ap050525.html\">particle sizes</a>\nthere being larger than the 10 meter average thickness of the rest of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">Saturn's rings</a>.\n\nShort light streaks in the frame are artificial image artifacts and\nhave nothing to do with\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UCCHjoQrM\">Saturn's ring plane</a>.\n\nPlanetary scientists will be studying\n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002060/\">ring images taken near\nequinox</a> to help better understand the dynamics and particle size distribution of the Solar System's most extensive ring system.",
