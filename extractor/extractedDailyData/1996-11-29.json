  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nIs Io the solar system's <i>Fissure King</i>?\n<a href=\"ap961120.html\">Well, probably not</a> ... but it is the most active\n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/io.htm\">volcanic moon</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/\">Active volcanoes</a> on Jupiter's moon Io\nwere a surprise discovery of\n<a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager_fs.html\">the Voyager missions</a> of the late 1970s.\n\nThe extent of Io's\n<a href=\"http://volcano2.pgd.hawaii.edu/eos/\">volcanic activity</a> today\nis being investigated close-up by the Galileo spacecraft currently exploring\nthe Jovian system.\n\nThe two frames above show a roughly 300 mile square area around\nthe <a href=\"ap950804.html\">Io volcano</a> called Marduk.\n\nThe left-hand view of Marduk was made by\nVoyager in 1979, the right-hand view by Galileo earlier this year.\n\n<a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/112696.html\">A comparison reveals</a> that dramatic changes have occured, including\nthe creation of a dark, linear feature running diagonally through\nthe Galileo image that is probably a huge volcanic fissure.",
