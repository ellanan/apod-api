  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTelescopes around the world are tracking a bright supernova that occurred in a nearby dusty galaxy. \n\nThe powerful stellar explosion was first noted earlier this month.\n\nThe nearby galaxy is the photogenic \n<a href=\"ap151119.html\">Centaurus A</a>, \nvisible with binoculars and known for impressive filaments of \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">light-absorbing dust</a> that cross its center. \n\nCen A is featured here in a \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2011/18/image/a/\">high-resolution</a> archival \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nimage, with an inset image featuring the \n<a href=\"ap160209.html\">supernova</a> taken from the ground only two days after discovery.\n\nDesignated \n<a href=\"http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2016/sn2016adj.html\">SN2016adj</a>, \nthe supernova is highlighted with crosshairs in the inset, appearing just to the left of a bright foreground star in our \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/milkyway_info.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-supernova.html\">supernova</a> is currently thought to be of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova\">Type IIb</a>, a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXUdRGw8UP4\">stellar-core-collapse supernova</a>, \nand is of high interest because it occurred \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5M4c_A1fqu8/maxresdefault.jpg\">so nearby</a> \nand because it is being seen through a known dust filament.\n\nCurrent and future observations of \n<a href=\"http://www.salt.ac.za/news/sn2016adj-supernova-in-centaurus-a/\">this supernova</a> \nmay give us new clues about the fates of massive stars and how some \n<a href=\"ap160125.html\">elements found</a> on our Earth were formed.",
