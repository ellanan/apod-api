  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nBack in 1979, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft flew past Jupiter and its moons. \n\nThe images in this mosaic, featuring the moon Io against a background of gas giant \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/0708-jupiters-clouds-a-primer.html\">Jupiter's diffuse swirling cloud bands</a>, \nwere recorded by Voyager's camera from a distance of about 8.3 million kilometers. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00378\">Io image from this mosaic</a> may be the first to show curious round features on \n<a href=\"ap140330.html\">Io's surface</a> \nwith dark centers and bright rims more than 60 kilometers across. \n\nNow known to be volcanic in origin, \nthese features were then thought likely to be impact craters, \n<a href=\"ap130716.html\">commonly seen on rocky bodies</a> \nthroughout the Solar System. \n\nBut as \n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Voyager</a> \ncontinued to approach Io, close-up pictures revealed a bizarre world devoid of impact craters, frequently resurfaced by volcanic activity.\n \nEarlier this year a new robotic spacecraft, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html\">NASA's Juno</a>, began to orbit Jupiter and last week \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasas-juno-successfully-completes-jupiter-flyby\">made a pass within 5,000 kilometers</a> of Jupiter's clouds.\n\nDuring the next two years, it is hoped that \n<a href=\"ap110809.html\">Juno</a> will discover new things about Jupiter, for example \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/origin?show=hs_origin_story_whats-in-jupiters-core\">what's in Jupiter's core</a>.",
