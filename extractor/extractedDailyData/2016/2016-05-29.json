  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMars will look good in Earth's skies over the next few days -- but not this good.\n\nTo get a view \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-mars.html\">this amazing</a>, a spacecraft had to actually visit the red planet.\n\nRunning across the image center, though, is one the largest canyons in the \n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Solar System</a>.\n\nNamed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crsqzZNUXsY\">Valles Marineris</a>, the grand valley extends \nover 3,000 kilometers long, spans as much as \n600 kilometers across, \nand delves as much as 8 kilometers deep.  \n\nBy comparison, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon\">Earth's Grand Canyon</a> \nin Arizona, USA is 800 kilometers long, 30 kilometers across, \nand 1.8 kilometers deep.  \n\nThe origin of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valles_Marineris\">Valles Marineris</a> remains unknown, although a leading hypothesis holds that it started as a \n<a href=\"ap980310.html\">crack</a> billions of years ago as the planet cooled.  \n\nSeveral geologic processes have been identified in \n<a href=\"http://www.windows2universe.org/mars/interior/Valles_Marineris.html\">the canyon</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-mars.html\">featured mosaic</a> was \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/marsglobe1.txt\">created</a> from over 100 images of \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/facts/\">Mars</a> taken by \n<a href=\"http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/viking.htm\">Viking</a> Orbiters in the 1970s.  \n\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7ypke0sjV1U/UQzBFZCoscI/AAAAAAAAIQA/MWBVUGcnzqU/s1600/funny-definition-tomorrow-picture.jpg\">Tomorrow</a>, Mars and Earth will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ-qbykREXE\">pass the closest</a> in 11 years, resulting in the red planet being \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/mars-close-approach/\">quite noticeable</a> toward the southeast after sunset.",
