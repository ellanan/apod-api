  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow did the universe evolve from such a smooth beginning?\n\nTo help understand, computational cosmologists and \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> produced the \n<a href=\"http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=10663\">featured time-lapse animated video</a> depicting a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...731...11C\">computer simulation</a> of part of the universe.\n\nThe 100-million light-year \n<a href=\"ap140512.html\">simulation</a> starts about 20 million years after the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang\">Big Bang</a> \nand runs until the present. \n\nAfter a smooth beginning, gravity causes clumps of matter to form into \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18005\">galaxies</a> which immediately begin falling toward each other.\n\nSoon, many of them condense into long \n<a href=\"ap050725.html\">filaments</a> while others violently merge into a \nhuge and hot <a href=\"ap100502.html\">cluster of galaxies</a>. \n\nInvestigating of potential universe attributes in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vqlZiUYwKc\">simulations</a> like this have helped shape the engineering design the \n<a href=\"http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, \ncurrently scheduled for launch in late 2018.",
