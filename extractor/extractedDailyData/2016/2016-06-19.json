  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's older than these ancient trees?\n\nNobody you know -- but almost everything in the background of this picture.\n\nThe trees are impressively old -- each part of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Bristlecone_Pine_Forest\">Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest</a> located in eastern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.\n\nThere, many of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(tree)\">oldest trees</a> known are \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5aQnbBypjk\">located</a>, some dating as far back as about \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_century_BC\">5,000 years</a>.  \n\nSeemingly attached to tree branches, \nbut actually much farther in the distance, are the \n<a href=\"ap160510.html\">bright orbs</a> of \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/Saturn\">Saturn</a> (left) and \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/facts/#?c=inspace&amp;s=distance\">Mars</a>.\n\nThese planets \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\">formed</a> along with the \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> and the early Solar System much earlier -- \nabout 4.5 billion years ago. \n\nSwooping down diagonally from the upper left is the oldest structure pictured: the \n<a href=\"ap990224.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> -- \ndating back around \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_natural_history\">9 billion years</a>. \n\nThe featured image \nwas built from several exposures all taken from the same location -- \nbut only a \n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/c12wLZX.jpg\">few weeks</a> ago.",
