  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is there a glowing oval over Jupiter's South Pole?\n\nAurora. \n\nNear the closest part of its first pass near \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9TtSCkoERw\">Jupiter</a> in August, NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html\">spacecraft \nJuno</a> captured \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21033/juno-s-view-of-jupiter-s-southern-lights\">this dramatic infrared image</a> of a bright \n<a href=\"ap160711.html\">auroral ring</a>.\n\nAuroras are caused by high energy particles from the Sun interacting with a planet's magnetic field, and \n<a href=\"ap031217.html\">ovals</a> around \n<a href=\"ap040919.html\">magnetic poles</a> are common. \n\nData from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZkiglD2_Mw\">Juno</a> \nare giving preliminary indications that \n<a href=\"ap160406.html\">Jupiter's magnetic field</a> and aurorae are unexpectedly powerful and \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/cassinis-final-year-and-junos-first/\">complex</a>. \n\nUnfortunately, a computer \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/juno-spacecraft-in-safe-mode-for-latest-jupiter-flyby\">glitch caused Juno</a> to go into \n<a href=\"http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/XX-Cats-With-Their-Mini-Mes1__700.jpg\">safe\nmode</a> during its October pass near the Jovian giant in October.\n\nThat glitch has now been resolved, making \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2016/11030800-juno-update.html\">Juno ready</a> for its next pass over Jupiter's cloud tops this coming Sunday.",
