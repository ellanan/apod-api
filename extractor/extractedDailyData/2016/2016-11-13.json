  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is so super about tomorrow's supermoon?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/novembers-spectacular-supermoon\">Tomorrow</a>, a full moon will occur that appears slightly larger and brighter than usual. \n\nThe reason is that the \n<a href=\"ap161012.html\">Moon's full</a>y illuminated phase occurs within a short time from perigee - when the Moon is its closest to the Earth in its elliptical orbit.\n\nAlthough the precise conditions that define a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAN0FwfD5M\">supermoon</a> vary, \ntomorrow's supermoon will undoubtedly qualify because it will be the \nclosest, largest, and brightest full moon in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTEQMemI3Pc\">over 65 years</a>. \n\nOne reason \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-supermoon\">supermoons</a> are popular is because they are so easy to see -- \njust go outside at sunset and watch an impressive full moon rise!\n\nSince perigee actually occurs tomorrow morning, tonight's \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">full moon</a>, visible starting at \n<a href=\"ap111127.html\">sunset</a>, should also be impressive.\n\nPictured here, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon\">supermoon</a> from 2012 is compared to a micromoon -- when a full Moon occurs near the furthest part of the Moon's orbit -- so that it appears smaller and dimmer than usual.\n\nGiven \nmany definitions, at least one \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/102763/what-is-a-super-moon/\">supermoon</a> \noccurs each year, with another one coming next month (moon-th). \n\nHowever, a full moon will not come this close to Earth again until 2034.",
