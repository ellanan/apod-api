  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis sharp telescopic\nfield of view holds two bright galaxies.  \n\nBarred spiral\n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat120.html\">NGC 5101</a>\n(top right) and\nnearly edge-on system\n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat099.html\">NGC 5078</a>\nare separated\non the sky by about 0.5 degrees or about the apparent width of a full\nmoon.\n\nFound within the boundaries of the serpentine\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nHydra_%28constellation%29\">constellation Hydra</a>,\nboth are estimated to be around 90 million light-years away and\nsimilar in size to our own large Milky Way galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaclus.html\">In fact</a>,\nif they both lie at the same distance their\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale_distance.html\">projected\nseparation</a> would be only 800,000 light-years or so.\n\nThat's easily less than half the distance between the\nMilky Way and the <a href=\"ap130927.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>.\n\nNGC 5078 is interacting with a smaller companion galaxy, cataloged as\nIC 879, seen just left of the larger galaxy's bright core.\n\nEven more distant background galaxies are scattered\naround the colorful field.\n\nSome are even visible right through the face-on disk of NGC 5101.\n\nBut the prominent <a href=\"ap121013.html\">spiky stars</a> are in\nthe foreground, well within our own Milky Way.",
