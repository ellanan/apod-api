  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat can this galaxy tell us about the expansion rate of the universe?\n\nPerhaps a lot because UGC 9391, \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1611b/\">featured</a>, \nnot only contains Cepheid variable stars (red circles) but also a recent \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/dark_energy/de-type_ia_supernovae.php\">Type Ia supernova</a> (blue X).\n\nBoth types of objects have standard brightnesses, with \n<a href=\"ap960110.html\">Cepheids</a> typically being seen relatively nearby, while supernovas are seen much farther away.\n\nTherefore, <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/hubble/57876-cepheids-in-ugc-9391/\">this spiral</a> is important because it allows a calibration between the near and distant parts of our universe.\n\nUnexpectedly, a \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01424\">recent analysis</a> of new Hubble data from UGC 9391 and several \n<a href=\"ap150216.html\">similar galaxies</a> has bolstered previous indications that Cepheids and supernovas are \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_expansion.html\">expanding with the universe</a> slightly  \n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/06/04/ask-ethan-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-expected/\">faster than expected</a> \nfrom expansion measurements of the early universe.\n\nGiven the \n<a href=\"http://www.earlyuniverse.org/concordance-or-contradiction/\">multiple successes</a> of early universe \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model\">concordance cosmology</a>, astrophysicists are now vigorously speculating about possible reasons for this discrepancy. \n\nCandidate explanations range from the \n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/theverybesttop10.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/the-world_s-top-10-best-images-of-surprised-cats-8.jpg?resize=584%2C552\">sensational</a>, \nsuch as the inclusion of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N\">unusual \ncosmological components</a> types such as \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00634\">phantom energy</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_radiation\">dark radiation</a>, to the \n<a href=\"http://kittentoob.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/02/872276176_c36c5f268c_z-640x428.jpg\">mundane</a>, including statistical flukes and underestimated sources of \n<a href=\" http://www.physics.umd.edu/courses/Phys276/Hill/Information/Notes/ErrorAnalysis.html\">systematic errors</a>. \n\nNumerous future observations are being planned to help resolve the conundrum.",
