  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nYoung suns still lie\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/image_galleries/legacy/\nspitzer_n7129/caption.html\">within dusty NGC 7129</a>, some\n3,000 light-years away toward the royal constellation\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/?p=3468\">Cepheus</a>.\n\nWhile <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4252\">these stars</a>\nare at a relatively tender age, only a few million years old, it is\nlikely that our own Sun formed in a similar stellar nursery some\nfive <i>billion</i> years ago.\n\nMost noticeable in\n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/NGC7129-Subaru-Composite.html\">\nthe sharp image</a> are the lovely bluish dust clouds\n<a href=\"ap011228.html\">that reflect</a> the youthful starlight.\n\nBut the compact, deep red crescent shapes are also markers\nof energetic, young stellar objects.\n\nKnown as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object\n#Discovery_and_history_of_observations\">Herbig-Haro</a> objects,\ntheir shape and color is characteristic of glowing hydrogen gas\n<a href=\"http://sparky.rice.edu/~hartigan/movies.html\">shocked by\njets</a> streaming away from newborn stars.\n\nPaler, extended filaments of\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309674\">reddish emission</a>\nmingling with the bluish\nclouds are caused by dust grains effectively converting the\ninvisible ultraviolet starlight to visible red light through\n<a href=\"ap051229.html\">photoluminesence</a>.\n\nUltimately the natal gas and dust in the region\nwill be dispersed, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster#Eventual_fate\">stars\ndrifting apart</a> as the loose\ncluster orbits the center of the Galaxy.\n\nThe processing of this remarkable composite image has revealed\nthe faint red strands of emission at the upper right.\n\nThey are recently recognized as a likely\n<a href=\"ap140404.html\">supernova remnant</a>\nand are currently being analyzed by Bo Reipurth (Univ. Hawaii) who\nobtained the image data at the Subaru telescope.\n\nAt the estimated distance of NGC 7129, this telescopic view spans\nover 40 light-years.",
