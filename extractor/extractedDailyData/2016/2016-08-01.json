  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's behind Saturn?\n\nThe first answer is the camera itself, perched on the \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting behind the planet with the \n\nmost grand ring system in our Solar System.\n\nThe unusual perspective places \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens\">Cassini</a> on the far side of Saturn from the Sun so that more than half of Saturn appears dark -- a perspective that no Earth-based observer could achieve. \n\nBehind Saturn, in the context of the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20488\">featured infrared image</a>, \nis Saturn's moon Tethys, visible as the small speck above the unusual \n<a href=\"ap130220.html\">hexagonal cloud</a> pattern that encompasses Saturn's North Pole. \n\n<a href=\"ap091208.html\">Tethys</a> actually orbits Saturn right in the ring plane, which places the 1000-km moon much farther from \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/index.html\">Cassini</a> than the planet itself.\n\nCassini has been \n<a href=\"ap110613.html\">studying Saturn</a> and its moons for 12 years, but, unfortunately, its amazing mission will soon come to an end.\n\nIn order to \n<a href=\"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6118082.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/main.jpg\">protect life</a> that may exist on or inside Saturn's moons, the robotic spacecraft will be directed to \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/\">crash into Saturn</a>'s thick atmosphere next September.",
