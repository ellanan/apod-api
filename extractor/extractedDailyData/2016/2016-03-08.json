  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe total solar eclipse of March 8/9 will be the only total\neclipse in 2016.\n\nCrossing the international date line,\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/\nnasa-releases-march-8-total-solar-eclipse-visualizations\">the New Moon's\ndark shadow</a> traces a limited, narrow path\nfor viewing the total phase,\nmaking landfall in Indonesia and mostly tracking across the Pacific\nOcean.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/?p=230175\">A much larger region\nwill be witness</a> to a partially eclipsed Sun though,\nduring morning hours on March 9 for southeast Asia and northeast\nAustralia, and before sunset March 8 for Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nSafely viewing the eclipse can actually be very easy.\n\nOne technique is demonstrated in this shoe group portrait\nfrom a classroom in Rosenfeld, Germany, taken during\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/157906051\">March 2015's solar eclipse</a>.\n\nWith blinds closed to darken the room, each threaded hole in the\nwindow blind creates a pinhole camera, projecting multiple\nimages of the eclipsed sun that march across the floor.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.de/movies/index.html?sofi20mar15.html\">Other\nviewing alternatives</a> include eclipse glasses and a comfortable\nchair, but be sure to wear a fashionable\n<a href=\"ap080802.html\">eclipse shirt</a>.",
