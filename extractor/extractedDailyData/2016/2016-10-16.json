  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat could cause a huge cylindrical mountain to rise from the surface of Venus? \nSuch features that occur on Venus are known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_(planetary_geology)\">coronas</a>. \n\nPictured here in the foreground is 500-kilometer wide Atete Corona found in a region of \n<a href=\" http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus\">Venus</a> known as the \n<a href=\"http://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/download/Venus/Geology/year-1990/Venus-GeologicGeomorphic-Map-of-the-Galindo-Quadrangle-V-40.pdf\">Galindo</a>. \nThe <a href=\" http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00096\">featured image</a> was created by combining multiple \n<a href=\" ap130623.html\">radar maps</a> of the region to form a computer-generated three-dimensional perspective. \nThe series of \n<a href=\" https://dtsft.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/2001.jpg\">dark rectangle</a>s that cross the image from top to bottom were created by the imaging procedure and are not real. \n\nThe origin of massive coronas remains a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.P51D..01S\">topic of research</a> \nalthough <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999Icar..139..100S\">speculation holds</a> they result from volcanism. \n\nStudying <a href=\"https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/venus/vencor.htm\">Venusian corona</a>s help scientists better understand the \ninner structure of both \n<a href=\" http://www.windows2universe.org/venus/interior.html\">Venus</a> and\n<a href=\" http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/earths-dynamiccore.html\">Earth</a>.",
