  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo, this castle was not built with the Moon attached. \n\nTo create the spectacular juxtaposition, careful planning and a bit of good weather was needed. \n\nPictured, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-three-supermoons\">last supermoon of 2016</a> was captured last week rising \ndirectly beyond one of the towers of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellver_Castle\">Bellver Castle</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma,_Majorca\">Palma de Mallorca</a> on the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balearic_Islands\">Balearic Islands</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon\">supermoon</a> \nwas the last full moon of 2016 and known to some as the \n<a href=\"http://www.celticmythmoon.com/moon.html\">Oak Moon</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ha_kZuwcuM\">Bellver Castle</a> was built in the early 1300s and \nhas served as a home -- but occasional as a prison -- to numerous kings and queens. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Moon\">Moon was built</a> \nabout 4.5 billion years ago, possibly resulting from a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKmSQqp8wY\">great collision</a> \nwith a Mars-sized celestial body and Earth. \n\nThe next <a href=\"ap161114.html\">supermoon</a>, defined as when \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/moon\">the moon</a> appears slightly larger and brighter than usual, will occur on 2017 December 3 and be visible not only \n<a href=\"ap130525.html\">behind castles</a> but all over the Earth.",
