  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/transit/catalog/\nMercuryCatalog.html\">Transits of Mercury</a> are relatively rare.\n\nMonday's leisurely 7.5 hour long event was only the 3rd of 14 Mercury\ntransits in the 21st century.\n\nIf you're willing to travel,\n<a href=\"https://www.calsky.com/?ISS\">transits of the International\nSpace Station</a> can be more frequent though, and much quicker.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophoto.fr/mercury-transit-2016.html\">This sharp\nvideo frame composite</a> was taken from a well-chosen location\nin Philadelphia, USA.\n\nIt follows the space station, moving from upper right to lower\nleft, as it crossed the Sun's disk in 0.6 <i>seconds.</i>\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/index.php?&amp;title=mercury\">Mercury\ntoo</a> is included as the small, round, almost stationary\nsilhouette just below center.\n\nIn apparent size, the International Space Station looms larger\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/\nindex.html\">from low Earth orbit</a>,\nabout 450 kilometers from Philadelphia.\n\nMercury was about 84 million kilometers away.\n\n(Editor's note:\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophoto.fr/mercury-transit-2016.html\">The stunning\nvideo</a> includes another\ndouble transit, Mercury and a Pilatus PC12 aircraft. Even quicker\nthan the ISS to cross the Sun, the aircraft was about 1 kilometer\naway.)",
