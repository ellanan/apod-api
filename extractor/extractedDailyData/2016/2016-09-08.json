  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWandering through this stunning field of view,\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/main/index.html\">Mars\nreally</a> is in front of these colorful cosmic clouds.\n\nThe mosaic contructed from telescopic images\nis about 5 degrees (10 full moons) across.\n\nIt captures the planet's position on August 26,\nover 7 light-minutes from Earth and\nvery near the line-of-sight to\n<a href=\"ap150222.html\">bright star Antares</a> and the\nRho Ophiuchi cloud complex.\n\nIn the exposure yellow-hued Mars, above and left, is almost\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/antares.html\">matched\nby Antares</a>, also known as Alpha Scorpii, below center.\n\nGlobular star cluster M4 shines just right of Antares,\nbut M4 lies some 7,000 light-years away compared to Antares'\n500 light-year distance.\n\nSlightly closer than Antares, Rho Ophiuchi's bluish starlight is\nreflected by the dusty\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0005\">molecular clouds</a>\nnear the top of the frame.",
