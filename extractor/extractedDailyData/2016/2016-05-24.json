  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThat's not lightning, and it did not strike between those mountains.\n\nThe diagonal band is actually the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, while the twin peaks are actually called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Peaks\">Spanish Peaks</a> -- but located in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado\">Colorado</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nAlthough each \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK3iYPDfqzw\">Spanish peak</a> \nis composed of a slightly different type of rock, both are approximately \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene\">25 million years old</a>. \n\nThis serene yet spirited image composite was \n<a href=\"http://oopoomoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MarketingDog.jpg\">meticulously created</a> by merging a series of images all taken from the same location on one night and early last month.\n\nIn the first series of exposures, the background sky was built up, with great detail being revealed in the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/galaxy-location.html\">Milky Way</a> dust lanes as well as the \n<a href=\"ap160510.html\">large colorful region</a> \nsurrounding the star \n<a href=\"ap140727.html\">Rho Ophiuchus</a> just right of center. \n\nOne sky image, though, was taken using a \n<a href=\"http://www.exploringexposure.com/blog/2014/8/28/fog-filter-effect-for-stars-in-photoshop\">fogging filter</a> \nso that brighter stars would appear more spread out and so more prominent.\n\nAs a bonus, the planets \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/facts/\">Mars</a> and \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18015\">Saturn</a> \nare placed right above peaks and make an orange triangle with the bright star \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/antares-rivals-mars-as-the-scorpions-heart\">Antares</a>.\n\nLater that night, after the moonrise, the Moon itself \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/80YUmNWE124/hqdefault.jpg\">naturally illuminated</a> the snow covered mountain tops.",
