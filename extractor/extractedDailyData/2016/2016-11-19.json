  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe recognizable profile of the Pelican Nebula\nsoars nearly 2,000 light-years away in the high flying constellation\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cygnus.html\">Cygnus,\nthe Swan</a>.\n\nAlso known as IC 5070,\nthis interstellar cloud of gas and dust is appropriately found\njust off the \"east coast\"\n<a href=\"ap130903.html\">of the North America Nebula</a>\n(NGC 7000), another surprisingly familiar looking emission nebula\n<a href=\"ap101119.html\">in Cygnus</a>.\n\nBoth Pelican and North America nebulae are part of the\nsame <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201373\">large and\ncomplex</a> star forming region, almost as nearby as the\nbetter-known Orion Nebula.\n\nFrom our vantage point, dark dust clouds (upper left) help define\nthe Pelican's eye and long bill, while a\n<a href=\"ap111126.html\">bright front</a> of ionized gas\nsuggests the curved shape of the head and neck.\n\nThis striking synthesized color view utilizes\nnarrowband image data recording the emission of hydrogen and\noxygen atoms in the cosmic cloud. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.skyatnightimages.co.uk/deep_sky.htm\">The scene spans</a>\nsome 30 light-years at the estimated distance of the Pelican Nebula.",
