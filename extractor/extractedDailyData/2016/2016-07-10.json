  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that next to the Moon?\n\nJupiter -- and its four largest moons. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LMjs0iJw3Q\">Skygazers</a>\naround planet Earth enjoyed the close encounter of planets and\nMoon in 2012 July 15's <a href=\"ap120719.html\">predawn skies</a>.\n\nAnd while many saw bright Jupiter next to the slender, waning crescent,\nEuropeans also had the opportunity to watch the\n<a href=\"ap120302.html\">ruling gas giant</a> pass\nbehind the lunar disk, occulted by the Moon as it slid through the\nnight.\n\nClouds threaten in this telescopic view from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXh4apOCe7w\">Montecassiano</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>, but\nthe frame still captures Jupiter after it emerged from the occultation\nalong with all four of its large <a href=\"ap091023.html\">Galilean</a> moons.\n\nThe sunlit crescent is overexposed with the Moon's night side faintly\nilluminated by <a href=\"ap120324.html\">Earthshine</a>.\n\nLined up left to right beyond the dark lunar limb are Callisto,\nGanymede, Jupiter, Io, and Europa. \n\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\ngalileanfact_table.html\">In fact</a>,\nCallisto, Ganymede, and Io are larger than Earth's Moon, while\n<a href=\"ap120524.html\">Europa is</a> only slightly smaller.\n\nLast week, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html\">NASA's Juno</a> became the second \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">spacecraft</a> ever to orbit Jupiter.",
