  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the closest star to our Sun have planets? \n\nNo one is sure -- but you can now \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pale_red_dot\">follow frequent updates</a> of a \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann16003/\">new search</a> \nthat is taking place during the first few months of this year.\n\nThe closest star, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri\">Proxima Centauri</a>, is the <a href=\"ap010318.html\">nearest</a> member of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri\">Alpha Centauri star system</a>.  \n\nLight takes only 4.24 years to reach us from \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/space/this-date-in-science-discovery-of-proxima-centauri\">Proxima Centauri</a>.  \n\nThis <a href=\"https://stardate.org/radio/program/proxima-centauri\">small red star</a>, captured in the center of the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1343a/\">featured image</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://www.savinghubble.com/about/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nis so faint that it was only \n<a href=\"http://www.astrosurf.com/cielextreme/page107E.html\">discovered</a> in 1915 and is only visible through a telescope.  \n\nTelescope-created X-shaped \n<a href=\"ap971119.html\">diffraction spikes</a> surround Proxima Centauri, \nwhile several stars further out in our \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/galaxy-location.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> are visible in the background.  \n\nThe brightest star in the <a href=\"ap030323.html\">Alpha Centauri</a> system is \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri3EN9hXXrs\">quite similar</a> to our Sun, \nhas been known as long as recorded history, and is the third <a href=\"\nhttp://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/brightest.html\">brightest star</a> in the night sky.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.solstation.com/stars/alp-cent3.htm\">Alpha Centauri system</a> is primarily visible from \n<a href=\"ap001223.html\">Earth's Southern Hemisphere</a>.  \n\nStarting last week, the \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/\">European Southern Observatory</a>'s\n<a href=\"https://palereddot.org/\">Pale Red Dot project</a> \nbegan investigating slight changes in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri\">Proxima Centauri</a> \nto see if they result from a planet -- possibly an Earth-sized planet. \n\nAlthough unlikely, were a \n<a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151123112509-brussels-lockdown-cat-twitter-costello-nr-sot-00001915-exlarge-169.jpg\">modern civilization</a> found living on a planet orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/59336/proxima-centauri/\">Proxima Centauri</a>, \nits proximity makes it a reasonable possibility that humanity could \n<a href=\"https://briankoberlein.com/2015/02/19/e-t-phone-home/\">communicate</a> with them.",
