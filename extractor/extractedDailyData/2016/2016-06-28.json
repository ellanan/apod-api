  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat will NASA's Juno spacecraft find when it reaches Jupiter next Monday?\n\nVery little, if \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html\">Juno</a> does not survive \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/juno/\">Jupiter Orbit Insertion</a>, \na complex series of operations in an unknown environment just above Jupiter's cloud tops. \n\nIf successful, as explained in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2fknqVk2yk\">featured video</a>, \nJuno will swoop around Jupiter, passing closer than any previous spacecraft.\n\nThe goal is to decelerate, enter into a highly \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit\">elliptical orbit</a>, \nand begin two years of science operations.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html\">Juno's science mission objectives</a> include mapping Jupiter's deep structure, determining how much water is in Jupiter's atmosphere, and exploring Jupiter's powerful magnetic field and how it creates \n<a href=\"ap001219.html\">auroras</a> around Jupiter's poles. \n\nThese <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUupykttb_Y\">lessons</a> \nhold promise to help humanity better understand the history of our Solar System and the dynamics of our Earth. \n\nJuno is powered predominantly by three \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)#/media/File:Illumination_test_on_one_of_Juno%27s_solar_panels.jpg\">large solar panels</a>, \neach measuring a side of small truck. \n\n<a href=\"ap110809.html\">Launched in 2011</a>, Juno's planned mission will take it around the Jovian giant 37 times, after which, to avoid contaminating \n<a href=\"ap960806.html\">Europa</a> with microbes, \nit will be directed to \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/deorbit\">dive into Jupiter</a>'s \nthick atmosphere, where it will break apart and melt.",
