  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created these unusually long shadows on Saturn's rings?\n\nThe dark shadows -- visible near the middle of the image -- extend opposite the Sun and, given their length, stem from objects having heights up to a few kilometers. \n\nThe long shadows were unexpected given that the usual thickness of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#/media/File:Saturn%27s_ring_plane.svg\">Saturn's A and B rings</a> is only about 10 meters.\n\nAfter considering the choppy but elongated shapes apparent near the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#B_Ring\">B-ring</a> edge, however, a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140.1747S\">leading theory</a>\nhas\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...765L...4H\">emerged</a> \nthat some kilometer-sized moonlets exist there that have enough gravity to create even larger vertical deflections of nearby small ring particles.\n\nThe resulting ring waves are called \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2010-227\">propellers</a>, named for \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=2663\">how they appear individually</a>.\n\nIt is these coherent groups of smaller ring particles that are hypothesized to be casting the long shadows.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11668\">featured image</a> \nwas taken by the \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Saturn.\n\nThe image was captured in 2009, near \n<a href=\"ap090901.html\">Saturn's equinox</a>, when sunlight streamed directly over the \n<a href=\"ap150621.html\">ring plane</a> and caused the longest shadows to be cast.",
