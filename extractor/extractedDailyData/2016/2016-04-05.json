  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy might you want to visit super-earth Cancri 55 e?\n\nIts extremely hot climate would be a deterrent, \nand <a href=\"ap120429.html\">fresh lava flows</a> might be common. \n\nDiscovered in 2004, the planet \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_Cancri_e\">Cancri 55 e</a> \nhas twice the diameter of our Earth and about 10 times Earth's mass.\n\nThe planet orbits its 40 light-year distant \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_Cancri\">Sun-like star</a> \nwell inside the orbit of Mercury, so close that it is \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/123391/what-is-tidal-locking/\">tidally locked</a>, \nmeaning that it always keeps the same face toward the object it orbits -- like our Moon does as it orbits the Earth.\n\nAstronomers have \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2016-090\">recently measured</a> \ntemperature changes on this exoplanet using \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves.html\">infrared</a> observations with the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/mission/32-The-Mission\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.\n\nGiven these observations, an artist created the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I3X6hSOrhQ\">featured video</a> \nwith educated guesses about what one revolution of Cancri 55 e might look like.\n\nDepicted are full phase, when the planet is fully illuminated, and new (dark) \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4404\">phase</a> when it passes near the line of sight to Earth. \n\nThe illustrated red bands on the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/pia15622.html\">Cancri 55 e</a> \nindicate bands of lava that might flow on the planet. \n\nA recent density determination for \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/13jan_rethink/\">55 Cancri e</a> \nshow that this exoplanet is <i>not</i> made primarily of \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a>, as are the inner planets in our Solar System, but rather of \n<a href=\"ap160125.html\">carbon</a>. \n\nTherefore, one reason to visit \n<a href=\"ap040901.html\">Cancri 55 e</a> \nmight be to study its core, because this planet's great internal pressure might be sufficient to make the carbon found there into \n<a href=\"http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2013/07/12/jasons-blog-next-stop-diamond-planets/\">one huge diamond</a>.",
