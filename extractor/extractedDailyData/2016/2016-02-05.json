  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nMassive stars lie <a href=\"ap131022.html\">within\nNGC 6357</a>, an expansive emission nebula complex\nsome 6,500 light-years away toward the tail of the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sco/index.html\">Scorpius</a>.\n\nIn fact, positioned near center\n<a href=\"http://chart32.de/index.php/component/k2/item/82\">in this\nground-based close-up</a> of NGC 6357,\nstar cluster <a href=\"ap121118.html\">Pismis 24</a>\nincludes some of the most massive stars known\nin the galaxy, stars with nearly 100 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nThe nebula's bright central region also contains dusty pillars of\nmolecular gas, likely hiding massive protostars from the\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609304\">prying eyes</a>\nof optical instruments.\n\nIntricate shapes in the nebula are carved as interstellar winds\nand energetic radiation from the young and newly forming\n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/StevII.html\">massive\nstars</a> clear out the natal gas and dust and power the nebular\nglow.\n\nEnhancing the nebula's cavernous appearance, narrowband image data\nwas included in this composite color image in a\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures/\nmeaning_of_color/eagle.php\">Hubble palette</a> scheme.\n\nEmission from sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms is shown in red\ngreen and blue hues.\n\nThe alluring telescopic view spans about 50 light-years at\nthe estimated distance of NGC 6357.",
