  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA new sky is becoming visible.\n\nWhen you look up, you see the sky as it appears in light -- \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro.html\">electromagnetic radiation</a>.\n\nBut just over the past year, humanity has begun to see our once-familiar sky as it appears in a different type of radiation -- \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave\">gravitational radiation</a>. \n\nToday, the \n<a href=\"http://ligo.org/about.php\">LIGO collaboration</a> is \n<a href=\"https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P151226/public/main\">reporting the detection of GW151226</a>, \nthe second confirmed flash of gravitational radiation after \n<a href=\"ap160211.html\">GW150914</a>, \nthe historic first detection registered three months earlier.\n\nAs its name implies, GW151226 was recorded in late December of 2015.\n\nIt was detected simultaneously by \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA/page/facilities\">both LIGO facilities</a> \nin \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO3g2Hhg25c\">Washington</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVNlPUcPlB0\">Louisiana</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsA34rRHpuA\">featured video</a>, \nan animated plot demonstrates how the frequency of \nGW151226 changed with time during measurement by the \nHanford, Washington detector. \n\nThis GW-emitting system is best fit by \n<a href=\"ap160212.html\">two merging black holes</a> \nwith initial masses of about 14 and 8 solar masses at a \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/cosmological+redshift\">redshift</a> of roughly 0.09, \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">meaning</a>, if correct, \nthat it took roughly 1.4 billion years for this radiation to reach us.\n \nNote that the brightness and \n<a href=\"http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html\">frequency</a> -- here mapped into sound -- of the \n<a href=\"http://ligo.org/science/faq.php\">gravitational radiation</a> \npeaks during the last second of the black hole merger.\n\nAs <a href=\"https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/summary.html\">LIGO continues</a> to operate, as its sensitivity continues to increase, and as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory#Specific_operational_and_planned_gravitational-wave_detectors\">other gravitational radiation detectors</a> come online in the next few years, humanity's \n<a href=\"http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/2x2209185/high-angle-view-of-group-of-spectators-sitting-in-a-movie-theater-wearing-3-d-glasses.jpg\">new view of the sky</a> will surely change humanity's \n<a href=\"http://www.dailygalaxy.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/20/artifacts_2.gif\">understanding</a> \nof the universe.",
