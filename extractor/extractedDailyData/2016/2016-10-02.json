  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes both heaven and Earth erupt.\n\nColorful aurorae erupted unexpectedly a few years ago, with \n<a href=\"ap110517.html\">green aurora</a> appearing near the horizon and brilliant bands of \n<a href=\"ap120201.html\">red aurora</a> blooming high overhead. \n\nA bright Moon lit the foreground of this picturesque scene, \nwhile <a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?t=29789#p186007\">familiar stars</a> could be seen far in the distance. \n\nWith planning, the careful astrophotographer shot this image mosaic in the field of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Dome_Geyser\">White Dome Geyser</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park\">Yellowstone National Park</a> \nin the western USA.\n\nSure enough, just after midnight, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL-sh5GQNCE\">White Dome erupted</a> -- spraying a stream of water and vapor many meters into the air.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyser\">Geyser</a> water is heated to steam by \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xExdEXOaA9A\">scalding magma</a> several \nkilometers below, and rises through rock \n<a href=\"ap020602.html\">cracks</a> to the surface.\n\nAbout half of all known geysers occur in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV-RQHPQu2Y\">Yellowstone National Park</a>.\n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast29dec99_1/\">geomagnetic storm</a> \nthat created these aurorae has since subsided, eruptions of White Dome Geyser continue about every 30 minutes.",
