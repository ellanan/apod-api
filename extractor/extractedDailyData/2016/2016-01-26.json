  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt is a candidate for the brightest and most powerful explosion ever seen -- \n<a href=\"http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/news/2016/record-shattering-cosmic-blast-could-help-crack-case-extreme-supernova-explosions\">what is it?</a>  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/news/2016/01/14/brightlight/\">flaring spot of light</a> was found by the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml\">All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</a> \n(ASASSN) in June of last year and labelled \n<a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6270/257\">ASASSN-15lh</a>. \n\nLocated about three billion \n<a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light years</a> distant, the source appears tremendously bright for anything so far away: \nroughly 200 times brighter than an average \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">supernova</a>, \nand temporarily 20 times brighter than all of the stars in our \n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> combined.\n\nWere light emitted by \n<a href=\"http://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2016/January/01.14-luminous-supernova.php\">ASASSN-15lh</a> at this rate in all directions at once, it would be the most \n<a href=\"ap071016.html\">powerful explosion</a> yet recorded.\n\nNo known stellar object was thought to create an explosion this powerful, although pushing the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...719L.204W\">theoretical limits for the spin-down</a> \nof highly-magnetized neutron star -- a \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/missions/deepspace/f_magnetars.html\">magnetar</a> -- gets close. \n\nAssuming <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/assets/ASASSN-15lh_image_eng.jpg\">the flare</a> fades as expected later this year, \nastronomers are planning to use telescopes including \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble</a> \nto zoom in on the region to gain more clues. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/news/2016/01/14/brightlight/\">above-featured</a> artist's illustration \ndepicts a hypothetical night sky of a planet located across the host galaxy from the outburst.",
