  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does star KIC 8462852 keep wavering? \n\n<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe\">Nobody knows.</a> \n\nA star somewhat similar to our Sun, \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03622\">KIC 8462852</a> was one of many distant stars being monitored by NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/QuickGuide/\">Kepler satellite</a> \nto see if it had planets.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.planethunters.org/#/about\">Citizen scientists</a> \nvoluntarily co-inspecting the data along with computers found this unusual case where a star's brightness dropped at \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z3rfv8FBdTY/maxresdefault.jpg\">unexpected</a> times by as much as 20 percent for as long as months -- \nbut then recovered.\n\nCommon reasons for dimming -- such as \n<a href=\"ap160511.html\">eclipses</a> by \n<a href=\"ap160507.html\">orbiting planets</a> or stellar companions -- \ndon't match the non-repetitive nature of the dimmings.\n\nA currently debated theory is dimming by a cloud of comets or the remnants of a shattered planet, but these would not explain data indicating that the star itself has become \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...822L..34S\">slightly dimmer</a> over the past 125 years. \n\nNevertheless, \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=pia18469\">featured here</a> is an artist's illustration of a planet breaking up, \ndrawn to depict \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-291\">NGC 2547-ID8</a>, \na different system that shows \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves.html\">infrared</a> evidence of such a collision.\n\nRecent observations of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852\">KIC 8462852</a> \ndid not detect the infrared glow of a closely orbiting \n<a href=\"ap141117.html\">dust disk</a>, but \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03693\">gave a hint</a> that the system might have such a disk farther out. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.wherestheflux.com/\">Future observations</a> are encouraged \nand \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852#A_megastructure\">creative origin speculation</a>s are sure to continue.",
