  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays.html\">Gamma-rays</a>\nand dust from periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle plowed through\nplanet Earth's atmosphere on the night of August 11/12.\n\nImpacting at about 60 kilometers per <i>second</i> the grains of\ncomet dust produced this year's remarkably\nactive Perseid meteor shower.\n\nThis composite wide-angle image of aligned shower meteors\ncovers a 4.5 hour period on\n<a href=\"ap160818.html\">that Perseid night</a>.\n\nIn it the flashing meteor streaks can be traced\nback to the shower's origin on the sky.\n\nAlongside the Milky Way in the constellation Perseus,\nthe radiant marks the direction along the perodic\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994MNRAS.266..305Y\">comet's\norbit</a>.\n\nTraveling at the speed of light, cosmic gamma-rays impacting Earth's\natmosphere generated showers too, showers of high energy particles.\n\nJust as the meteor streaks point back to their origin, the\neven briefer flashes of light from the particles can be used\nto reconstruct the direction of the\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/\nhigh-energy-%CE%B3-ray-astronomy-comes-back-to-earth-1.13230\">particle\nshower</a>, to point\nback to the origin on the sky of the incoming gamma-ray.\n\nUnlike the meteors, the incredibly fast particle shower flashes\ncan't be followed by eye.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00987\">But both</a>\ncan be followed by the high speed cameras on the\n<a href=\"ap111014.html\">multi-mirrored</a> dishes in the foreground.\n\nOf course, the dishes\n<a href=\"https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/\">are MAGIC</a>\n(Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes,\nan Earth-based gamma-ray observatory on the Canary Island of La Palma.",
