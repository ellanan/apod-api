  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is this meteor doing?\n\nDynamically, the unusually short and asymmetric \n<a href=\"ap151116.html\">train</a> may indicate that the sand-sized grain at the center of the glow is momentarily spinning as \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975MNRAS.173..339H\">it ablates</a>, \ncausing its path to be \n<a href=\"ap050202.html\">slightly spiral</a>. \n\nGeographically, the meteor appears to be going through the \n<a href=\"ap130304.html\">Heart Nebula</a>, although really it is in \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> and so is about one \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix\">quad</a>rillion times closer.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.clarkvision.com/galleries/gallery.astrophoto-1/web/heart-nebula+meteor-300mm.rnclark.av18.c08.12.2016.0J6A0119-64.g-1400s.html\">Taken last month</a> on the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/watchtheskies/perseid-meteor-shower-aug11-12.html\">night of the peak</a>, \nthis meteor is likely from the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseid</a> meteor shower.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap160808.html\">Perseids radiant</a>, in the constellation of Perseus, is \n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/everydayhomeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kitten101.jpg?w=400\">off the frame</a> to the upper right, \ntoward the direction that the meteor streak is pointing.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Nebula\">Heart Nebula</a> \nwas imaged in 18 one-minute exposures, \nof which the \n<a href=\"ap100602.html\">unusual meteor streak</a> appeared on just one. \n\nThe meteor train is \n<a href=\"http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/\">multicolored</a> \nas its glow emanates from different elements in the heated gas.",
