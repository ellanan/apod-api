  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOn the Moon, the Earth never rises -- or sets. \n\nIf you were to sit on the surface of the Moon, you would see the Earth just hang in the sky.\n\nThis is because the Moon always keeps the \n<a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2014/dec/2-ask-discover\">same side</a> toward the Earth.\n\nCuriously, the <a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/895\">featured image</a> does picture the Earth setting over a lunar edge. \n\nThis was possible because the image was taken from a spacecraft <i> orbiting </i> the Moon - specifically the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/overview/index.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO).\n\nIn fact, LRO orbits the Moon so fast that, from the spacecraft, the \n<a href=\"ap150906.html\">Earth appears</a> to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVrs6Sv5mvM\">set anew</a> about every two hours.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/lro-earthrise-2015\">featured image</a> \ncaptured one such Earthset about three months ago. \n\nBy contrast, from the surface of the Earth, the \n<a href=\"ap130814.html\">Moon sets</a> about once a day -- with the \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/12/18/earthrise_as_seen_from_lro_orbiting_the_moon.html\">primary cause</a> being the rotation of the Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">LRO</a> was launched in 2009 and, \nwhile creating a detailed three dimensional map of the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130916.html\">Moon's surface</a>, \nis also \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-LRO-k4.html\">surveying the Moon</a> for \n<a href=\"ap101025.html\">water</a> and possible good landing spots for \n<a href=\"http://astronauts.nasa.gov/\">future astronauts</a>.",
