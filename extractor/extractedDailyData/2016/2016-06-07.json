  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is Venus so different from Earth? \n\nTo help find out, Japan launched the robotic \n<a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/article/2016/interview/vol95/index.html\">Akatsuki</a> spacecraft which \n<a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/02/20150206_akatsuki.html\">entered orbit</a> around Venus late \nlast year after an unplanned five-year adventure around the inner \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nEven though <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_(spacecraft)\">Akatsuki</a> has passed its original planned lifetime, the spacecraft and its instruments are operating so well that much of its original mission has been \n<a href=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/2016/05/17/japanese-orbiter-officially-begins-science-mission-at-venus/\">reinstated</a>.\n\nIn the <a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/planet_c/topics.html\">featured image</a> taken by \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/akatsuki\">Akatsuki</a> late last month, Venus was captured in infrared light showing a surprising amount of \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/venus/color-image-of-venus-glowing.html\">atmospheric structure</a> on its night side.\n\nThe vertical orange \n<a href=\"ap150427.html\">terminator stripe</a> \nbetween night and day is so wide because of light is so diffused by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus\">Venus' thick atmosphere</a>. \n\nAlso known as the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/indepth\">Venus</a> Climate Orbiter, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsDj-KJe65s\">Akatsuki</a> has cameras and instruments that will \n<a href=\"http://www.gapphotos.com/images/WebPreview/0100/0100358.jpg\">investigate unknowns</a> about the planet, including whether \n<a href=\"ap950928.html\">volcanoes</a> are still active, \nwhether lightning occurs in the dense atmosphere, and why wind speeds \n<a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2010-05-theory-superrotation-venus.html\">greatly exceed</a> the planet's rotation speed.",
