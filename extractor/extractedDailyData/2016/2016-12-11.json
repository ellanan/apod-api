  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created the strange spiral structure on the left?  \n\nNo one is sure, although it is likely related to a star in a \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star</a> system entering the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> phase, when its outer atmosphere is ejected.\n \nThe <a href=\"ap151130.html\">huge spiral</a> spans about a third of a \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light year</a> across and, winding four or five complete turns, has a regularity that is without precedent.  \n\nGiven the expansion rate of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral\">spiral</a> gas, a new layer must appear about every 800 years, a close match to the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other.\n\nThe star system that created it is most commonly known as \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...544L..18L\">LL Pegasi</a>, \nbut also AFGL 3068.  The unusual structure itself has been cataloged as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS_23166%2B1655\">IRAS 23166+1655</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1020a/\">featured image</a> was taken in near-<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves.html\">infrared</a> light by the \n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nWhy the <a href=\" http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo//Applets/Spiral/Spiral330.html\">spiral glows</a> is itself a mystery, \nwith a leading hypothesis being illumination by light reflected from nearby stars.",
