  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that dot on the Sun?\n\nIf you look closely, it is almost perfectly round.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.davidcortner.com/astro/mtransit/\">The dot</a> is the result of an unusual type of \n<a href=\"ap060404.html\">solar eclipse</a> that occurred in 2006. \n\nUsually it is the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/moon\">Earth's Moon</a> that eclipses the Sun.  \n\nThis time, the planet \n<a href=\"ap081008.html\">Mercury</a>\ntook a turn. \n\nLike the approach to New Moon before a\n<a href=\"ap040926.html\">solar eclipse</a>, \nthe phase of Mercury became a continually thinner \n<a href=\"ap061030.html\">crescent</a> as the planet\nprogressed toward an alignment with the Sun. \n\nEventually the phase of \n<a href=\"ap040606.html\">Mercury dropped</a> to zero and\nthe dark spot of \n<a href=\"http://mercurytransit.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Mercury</a> crossed our parent star. \n\nThe situation could technically be labeled a Mercurian \n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">annular\neclipse</a> with an extraordinarily large \n<a href=\"ap130509.html\">ring of fire</a>. \n\nFrom above the \n<a href=\"ap040912.html\">cratered planes</a>\nof the night side of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2016/2016-transit-mercury/\">Mercury</a>, the Earth appeared in its fullest phase.  \n\nHours later, as Mercury continued in its orbit, a slight\ncrescent phase appeared again. \n\nThis was ten years ago -- the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nTransit_of_Mercury_from_Earth\">next Mercurian solar eclipse</a> will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gibaxh9x7O0\">occur tomorrow</a>.",
