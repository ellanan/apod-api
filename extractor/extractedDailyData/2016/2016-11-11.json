  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHot, young stars and\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1518/\">cosmic pillars</a>\nof gas and dust seem to crowd into NGC 7822.\n\nAt the edge of a giant\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/Bima/\nGMC.html\">molecular cloud</a> toward the northern\nconstellation Cepheus, the glowing star forming region\nlies about 3,000 light-years away.\n\nWithin the nebula, bright edges and dark shapes stand out in this\n<a href=\"http://www.starrywonders.com/ngc7822narrowbandsmall.html\">colorful\nskyscape</a>.\n\nThe image includes data from \n<a href=\"ap060324.html\">narrowband</a> filters,\nmapping emission from atomic oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur into blue,\ngreen, and red hues.\n\nThe emission line and color combination has become well-known as the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures/\nmeaning_of_color/eagle.php\">Hubble palette</a>.\n\nThe atomic emission is\n<a href=\"ap051223.html\">powered by</a> energetic radiation from\nthe central hot stars.\n\nTheir powerful winds and radiation sculpt and erode\nthe denser pillar shapes and clear out a\n<a href=\"ap150225.html\">characteristic</a> cavity light-years across\nthe center of  the natal cloud.\n\nStars could still be forming inside the pillars by\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/\ngravc.html#c1\">gravitational collapse</a> but as the pillars are\neroded away, any forming stars will ultimately be cutoff from their\nreservoir of\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2015/01/index.html\">star stuff</a>.\n\nThis field of view spans over 40 light-years at the estimated distance\nof NGC 7822.",
