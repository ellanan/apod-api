  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNGC 6888, also known as the Crescent Nebula, is a\ncosmic bubble about 25 light-years across, blown by\nwinds from its central, bright, massive star.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.remarkableheavens.com/#bwg1/190\">This\nsharp telescopic portrait</a> uses\nnarrow band image data that isolates light from hydrogen\nand oxygen <a href=\"ap060324.html\">atoms in</a> the wind-blown nebula.\n\nThe oxygen atoms produce the blue-green hue that seems to enshroud\nthe detailed folds and filaments.\n\nVisible within the nebula, NGC 6888's central star is classified as a\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~pberlind/atlas/htmls/\nwrstars.html\">Wolf-Rayet star</a> (WR 136).\n\nThe star is shedding its outer envelope in a strong\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\">stellar wind</a>,\nejecting the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 10,000 years. \n\nThe nebula's complex structures are likely the result of this\nstrong wind interacting with material ejected in an earlier phase.\n\nBurning fuel at a prodigious rate and\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/ngc6888/\">near the\nend</a> of its stellar life this star should ultimately go out\nwith a bang in a spectacular\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nWolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star#Supernovae\">supernova</a> explosion.\n\nFound in the <a href=\"ap151204.html\">nebula rich</a>\nconstellation Cygnus,\n<a href=\"http://oneminuteastronomer.com/5995/crescent-nebula-ngc-6888/\">NGC\n6888 is</a> about 5,000 light-years away.",
