  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening near the south pole of Jupiter?\n\nRecent images sent back by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html\">Juno spacecraft</a> are showing an interesting conglomeration \nof swirling clouds and what appear to be \n<a href=\"ap970808.html\">white ovals</a>.\n\nJuno arrived at Jupiter in July and is being placed into a wide, \nlooping orbit that will bring it near the gas giant -- and \n<a href=\"ap160914.html\">over its poles</a> -- about twice a month.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21108\">featured image</a> is a \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=175\">composite</a> taken by \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/to-jupiter-with-junocam\">JunoCam</a> and post-processed by a digitally savvy citizen scientist. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#White_ovals\">White ovals</a> have been observed elsewhere on Jupiter and are thought to be giant storm systems.\n\nThey have been observed to last for years, while typically showing \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-are-hurricanes-k4.html\">Category 5</a> wind speeds of around 350 kilometers per hour.\n\nUnlike Earthly \n<a href=\"ap040406.html\">cyclones</a> and \n<a href=\"ap161009.html\">hurricanes</a> where \n<a href=\"http://puppytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/04/Dogs_In_Wind_9.jpg\">high winds</a> circle regions of low pressure, \nwhite ovals on Jupiter show rotational directions indicating that they are \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2015/12/the-anticyclone\">anticylones</a> -- vortices centered on high pressure regions. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">Juno</a> \nwill continue to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgEsf4QcR0Q\">orbit Jupiter</a> \nover thirty more times while \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9TtSCkoERw\">recording</a> optical, spectral, and gravitational data meant to help \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html\">determine Jupiter's structure and evolution</a>.",
