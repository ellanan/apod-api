  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhen does Mars appear the largest?\n\nThis occurs when \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/opposition/\">Earth sweeps past Mars</a> in their respective orbits around the Sun, \ncreating a momentary Sun-Earth-Mars alignment called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(planets)\">opposition</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/mars-close-approach/\">featured image</a> shows the \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/space/mars-opposition-may-22-2016-how-to-see\">Mars opposition</a> that occurred earlier this year, \nas well as how Mars will look later this year. \n\nMars actually \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr_DwYHaxx4\">changes its size</a> \ncontinuously -- the monthly jumps in size are illustrative. \n\nDuring the first months of the year,  \nEarth's view toward Mars is from relatively far away and from a relatively sideways angle -- \n<a href=\"ap080714.html\">making Mars appear</a> small and at less than full phase \n(<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/20324/gibbous-moon/\">gibbous</a>). \n\nAs months progress, Mars appears increasingly larger and fuller. \n\nThe day Earth and \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/facts/\">Mars</a> were closest together was on May 30.  \n\nBy June, Earth had passed Mars, and part of the other side of Mars appeared shadowed. \n\nMars will now appear increasingly smaller during 2016. \n\nEven if you watch Mars from Earth \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNm0YGMgZFk\">all along its orbit</a>, \nthough, Mars will never show a \n<a href=\"ap130414.html\">crescent phase</a>.",
