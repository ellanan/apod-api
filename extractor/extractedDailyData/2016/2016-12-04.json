  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nFamiliar stars in Orion and constellations across the sky now have official names.\n\nOver the past year, the \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/about/\">International Astronomical Union</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/themes/buying_star_names/\">only</a> \nbody officially tasked with naming stars, \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/\">approved names</a> already in common use for \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/\">227 of the brightest stars</a>, including the most famous stars on the sky \n<a href=\"ap000611.html\">Sirius</a>, \n<a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap100106.html\">Betelgeuse</a>. \n\nPictured, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)\">constellation of Orion</a> is shown with several of these \nnow-official star names superposed. \n\nSpanning about 30 degrees, \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deepskycolors/16774216742\">this breath-taking vista</a> \nstretches across the well-known constellation from \n<a href=\"ap101023.html\">head to toe</a> (left to right) and beyond.\n\nThe common names for all three stars in <a href=\"ap131212.html\">Orion's belt</a>\nare also now official. \n\nAt 1,500 <a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light years</a> away, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula\">Great Orion\nNebula</a> is the closest large star forming region, here visible\njust right and below center.\n\nAlso visible are famous nebulae including the\n<a href=\"ap100513.html\">Horsehead Nebula</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap151030.html\">Witch Head Nebula</a>.\n\nOf course, the Orion Nebula and bright stars are\n<a href=\"ap030207.html\">easy to see</a> with the\nunaided eye, but dust clouds and emission from the extensive interstellar\ngas in this <a href=\"ap070106.html\">nebula-rich</a> complex,\nare too faint and much harder to record.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deepskycolors/16774216742\">featured mosaic</a> of broadband telescopic images, additional image\ndata acquired with a narrow\n<a href=\"ap051223.html\">hydrogen alpha</a> filter was used to\nbring out the pervasive tendrils of energized\natomic hydrogen gas like in the arc of the giant\n<a href=\"ap120123.html\">Barnard's Loop</a>.",
