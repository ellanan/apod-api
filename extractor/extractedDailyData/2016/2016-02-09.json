  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSit back and watch a star explode. \n\nThe actual supernova occurred back when \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous\">dinosaurs roamed the Earth</a>, \nbut images of the spectacular event began arriving last year. \n\nSupernova 2015F was discovered in nearby spiral galaxy \n<a href=\"ap100325.html\">NGC 2442</a> by \n<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berto_Monard\">Berto Monard</a> \nin 2015 March and was unusually bright -- enough to be seen with only a small telescope. \n\nThe pattern of brightness variation indicated a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia supernova</a> -- \na type of stellar explosion that results when an Earth-size \n<a href=\"ap150517.html\">white dwarf</a> \ngains so much mass that its core crosses the threshold of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion\">nuclear fusion</a>, \npossibly caused by a lower mass \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Artist%E2%80%99s_impression_of_two_white_dwarf_stars_merging_and_creating_a_Type_Ia_supernova.ogg\">white-dwarf companion spiraling</a> into it.\n\nFinding and tracking Type Ia \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-supernova.html\">supernovae</a> are particularly important because their intrinsic brightness can be calibrated, \nmaking their \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude\">apparent brightness</a> \na good measure of their distance -- and hence useful toward calibrating the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate96.html\">distance scale</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_expansion.html\">entire universe</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqUUXw-OXWU\">featured video</a> tracked the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..221...22I\">stellar disruption</a> from before explosion images arrived, as it brightened, \nand for several months as the \n<a href=\"http://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2013/01/30/fission-vs-fusion-whats-the-difference/\">fission</a>-powered supernova glow faded.\n\nThe remnants of \n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/aavso-alert-notice-515\">SN2015F</a> are now too dim to see without a large telescope. \n\nJust yesterday, however, the night sky lit up \n<a href=\"http://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2016adj\">once again</a>, this time with an \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=8651\">even brighter supernova</a> in an even closer galaxy: \n<a href=\"ap140630.html\">Centaurus A</a>.",
