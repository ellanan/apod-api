  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe hydrogen in your body, present in every molecule of water, came from the \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_tests_ele.html\">Big Bang</a>. \n\nThere are no other \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencealert.com/lhc-produces-primordial-soup-of-the-universe-using-less-particles-than-thought-possible\">appreciable</a> sources of \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> in the universe. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#Formation_in_stars\">carbon</a> in your body was made by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion\">nuclear fusion</a> \nin the interior of stars, as was the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Isotopes_and_stellar_origin\">oxygen</a>. \n\nMuch of the iron in your body was made during \n<a href=\"https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova</a>s of stars that occurred \nlong ago and far away. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap110911.html\">gold</a> in your jewelry was likely made from \nneutron stars during collisions that may have been visible as short-duration \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/bursts1.html\">gamma-ray bursts</a>. \n\nElements like phosphorus and copper are \n<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/144310-the-nitrogen-in-our-dna-the-calcium-in-our-teeth\">present in our bodies</a> in only small amounts but are \n<a href=\"http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Just-Elemental/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/The-essential-elements\">essential to the functioning</a> of all known \n<a href=\"http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2010/02/02_65.jpg\">life</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis#/media/File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg\">featured periodic table</a> is color coded to indicate \n<a href=\"ap100725.html\">humanity</a>'s best guess as to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis\">nuclear origin</a> of all known elements. \n\nThe sites of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EpcUohHees\">nuclear creation</a> \nof some elements, such as \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...585A.102Y\">copper</a>, \nare not really well known and are continuing topics of observational and computational research.",
