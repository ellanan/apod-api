  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn this November morning an old crescent Moon and morning star\nrise just before the Sun in a wide panoramic\nskyscape from Kenya's <a href=\"http://www.dreamview.net/dv/new/\nsearch.asp?keyword=ray+amboseli\">Amboseli National Park</a>.\n\nStill below the limbs of an acacia tree and the eastern horizon,\nthe Sun's position is easy to find though.\n\nIt's marked at the left by the subtle convergence of\nlight and shadow in the dawn sky.\n\nKnown as crepuscular rays, the warm-colored rays of sunlight are outlined by\n<a href=\"http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=76261\">shadows cast</a>\nby unseen clouds near the horizon.\n\nArcing above the profile of Mount Kilimanjaro, toward the right\nthe rays of light and shadow converge at the western horizon.\n\nThere known as anti-crepuscular rays, they indicate the point\nopposite the rising sun.\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/ray1.htm\">cloud shadows</a>\nare very nearly parallel, but converge toward the distant horizons\nbecause of perspective.",
