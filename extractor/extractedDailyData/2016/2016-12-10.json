  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe striking X appearing in this\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/\nindex.html\">lunarscape</a> is easily\nvisible in binoculars or a small telescope.\n\nYet, not too many have seen it.\n\nThe catch is this lunar X is fleeting, only apparent\nin the hours before the Moon's\n<a href=\"http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/\nmoonphase/\">first quarter phase</a>.\n\nAt the terminator, or shadow line between lunar day and night,\nthe X illusion is produced by a configuration of the craters\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/usgs/\nI822/\">Blanchinus, La Caille and Purbach</a>.\n\nNear the Moon's first quarter phase, an\n<a href=\"ap001209.html\">astronaut standing</a> close to\nthe craters' position would see the slowly rising Sun very\nnear the horizon.\n\nTemporarily, the crater walls would be in sunlight\nwhile the crater floors were still in darkness.\n\nSeen from <a href=\"ap071227.html\">planet Earth</a>,\ncontrasting sections of bright walls against\nthe dark floors by chance look remarkably like an X.\n\nThis sharp image of the Lunar X was captured at approximately 16:45 UT\non December 6, 2016.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.eyesonthesky.com/Moon/LunarX.aspx\">For extra\ncredit</a>, sweep your gaze along the lunar terminator and\nyou can also spot the Lunar V.",
