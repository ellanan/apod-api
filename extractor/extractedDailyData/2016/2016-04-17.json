  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat kind of clouds are these?\n\nAlthough their cause is presently unknown, such unusual atmospheric structures, \nas menacing as they might seem, do not appear to be harbingers of \n<a href=\"ap101130.html\">meteorological doom</a>.\n\nKnown informally as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undulatus_asperatus\">Undulatus asperatus</a> clouds, \nthey can be stunning in appearance, unusual in occurrence, are relatively unstudied, \nand have even been suggested as a new \n<a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/webweather/clouds/cloud-types\">type of cloud</a>.\n\nWhereas most low cloud decks are \n<a href=\"http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/fgz/science/flatcloud.php?wfo=fgz\">flat bottomed</a>, \n<a href=\"http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/asperatus-update/comment-page-2/\">asperatus clouds</a> appear to have significant vertical structure underneath.\n\nSpeculation therefore holds that \n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/06/20/asperatus-cloud-atlas/28994525/\">asperatus clouds</a> might be related to \n<a href=\"ap090121.html\">lenticular clouds</a> that form near mountains, \nor <a href=\"ap121023.html\">mammatus clouds</a> associated with thunderstorms, \nor perhaps a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind\">foehn wind</a> -- \na type of dry downward wind that flows off mountains.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nor%27west_arch\">Such a wind</a> \ncalled the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_arch\">Canterbury arch</a> \nstreams toward the east coast of New Zealand's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island,_New_Zealand\">South Island</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wittap/4406137868/in/set-72157623581503907\">featured image</a><a>, \ntaken above \n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanmer_Springs\">Hanmer Springs</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Region\">Canterbury</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a>, in 2005, \nshows great detail partly because sunlight illuminates the undulating clouds from the side.",
