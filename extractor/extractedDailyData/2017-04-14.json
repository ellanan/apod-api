  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThrough crystal clear skies this beautiful panorama follows the curve of\nplanet Earth's shadow rising across the\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/top-15-earth-images-of-2015\">top of\nthe world</a>.\n\nThe tantalizing twilight view is composed of eight single frames\ncaptured from 4,000 meters above sea level at sunset on April 6.\n\nJust above the dark grey\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/\nimage_feature_984.html\">Earth-shadow boundary</a> lies a fading, pinkish,\nanti-twilight arch.\n\nAlso known as the <a href=\"ap060615.html\">belt of Venus</a>, its\nreddened and back-scattered sunlight finally merges with the still blue\neastern sky.\n\nStanding tall near center along the rugged horizon line is the distant\nsharp peak of Mount Damavand in the snowy\n<a href=\"ap070203.html\">Alborz mountains</a>.\n\nA feature in Persian mythology and literature,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Damavand\">Damavand is</a> a\nstratovolcano reaching 5,610 meters above sea level, the highest peak in\nIran and the Middle East.",
