  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFrom 400 kilometers\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html\">above\nplanet Earth</a>, the Expedition 20 Crew\nonboard the International Space Station\n(<a href=\"ap090406.html\">ISS</a>) was able to witness a\nremarkable event from a remarkable vantage point --\nthe June 12 eruption of the\n<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/\nvolcano.cfm?vnum=0900-24=\">Sarychev Peak Volcano</a>.\n\nThe active volcano is located in Russia's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands\">Kuril Island chain</a>,\nstretching to the northeast of Japan.\n\nEmphasizing the orbital perspective, this stunning color\n<a href=\"http://www.tridi.be/\">stereo view</a>\nwas made by combining two\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/\nview.php?id=38985\">images from the ISS</a> and is\nintended to be viewed with\n<a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/glasses.html\">red/blue\nglasses</a> (red for the left eye).\n\nPunching upwards into the atmosphere at an early stage of the eruption,\nthe volcanic plume features a brown column of ash topped with a smooth,\nbubble-like, white cloud that is likely water condensation.\n\nBelow, a cloud of denser grey ash slides down the volcanic slope.\n\nAbout 1.5 kilometers of the island coastline is visible at ground\nlevel.\n\nThe evolving\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/\nevent.php?id=38937\">ash plume</a> posed no danger to the Expedition 20 crew,\nbut commercial airline flights were diverted away\nfrom the region to minimize the danger of engine failures from ash intake.",
