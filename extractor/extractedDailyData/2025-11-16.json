  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf this is Saturn, where are the rings?  \n\nWhen Saturn's \"appendages\" \n<a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/attic/huygensgcms/Shistory.htm\">disappeared</a> in 1612, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei\">Galileo</a> \ndid not understand why.   \n\nLater that century, it became understood that \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/\">Saturn</a>'s \nunusual <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/7ihpyi/psbattle_this_cat_peeking_over_the_edge/#lightbox\">protrusion</a>s were rings and that when the \n<a href=\"ap950801.html\">Earth crosses the ring plane</a>, \nthe edge-on rings will \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZaTAYOpUP6o\">appear to disappear</a>.  \n\nThis is because Saturn's rings are confined to a <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/108-How-large-are-Saturn-s-rings\">plane many times thinner</a>, in proportion, than a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor#/media/File:Parker-76R_Safety_Razor.jpg\">razor blade</a>.  \n\nIn modern times, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/\">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> that orbited Saturn frequently crossed \n<a href=\"ap040117.html\">Saturn's ring</a> plane during its mission to Saturn, \nfrom 2004 to 2017.  \n\nA series of plane crossing images from 2005 February \nwas dug out of the vast \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/cassini-raw-images/\">online Cassini raw image</a> archive by interested Spanish amateur \nFernando Garcia Navarro.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2005/05/31/saturn_sans_rings.html\">Pictured here</a>, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, \nis the striking result.  \n\n<a href=\"ap080720.html\">Saturn's thin ring plane</a> \nappears in blue, bands and clouds in \n<a href=\"ap041102.html\">Saturn's upper atmosphere</a> \nappear in gold.\n\nDetails of Saturn's rings can be seen in high \n<a href=\"ap090901.html\">dark shadows</a>.\n \nThe moons \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/dione/\">Dione</a> and \n<a href=\"ap250610.html\">Enceladus</a> appear as \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=18340&amp;p=230228#p230227\">bumps in the rings</a>.",
