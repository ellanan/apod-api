  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nToday, planet Earth passes through the plane of\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/\nrings.html\">Saturn's rings</a>.\n\nFrom the perspective of\n<a href=\"ap090304.html\">earthbound astronomers</a>, Saturn's rings\nwill be edge-on.\n\nThe problem is,\n<a href=\"http://nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn itself</a>\nis now very close to the Sun, low on\nhorizon after sunset, so good telescopic images will be difficult\nto come by.\n\nStill,\n<a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/\n6yearsofsaturn.html\">this composite of Saturn views</a>\ntaken from 2004 - 2009 (lower right to upper left) illustrates\n<a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/\n6_years_of_saturn.html\">the change</a> in ring tilt\nover the last six years and includes a nearly edge-on\nring view, based on images captured earlier this year.\n\nWhile Saturn's <a href=\"ap061113.html\">south pole</a> is clearly\nseen in the sequence,\nparticularly at the lower right, it will be hidden in the coming\nyears.\n\nSaturn's <a href=\"ap070403.html\">north pole</a> will be increasingly\nvisible, along with\nthe tilting rings, as the planet emerges this fall in the\npredawn sky.",
