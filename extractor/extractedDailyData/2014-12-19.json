  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/elvis/elnix.html\">The 1970s</a>\nare sometimes ignored by astronomers,\n\nlike this beautiful grouping of reflection nebulae\nin Orion - NGC 1977, NGC 1975, and NGC 1973 - \nusually overlooked in favor of the substantial glow from the\nnearby stellar nursery better known as the\n<a href=\"ap060119.html\">Orion Nebula</a>.\n\nFound along Orion's sword just north\nof the bright Orion Nebula complex, these reflection nebulae are\nalso associated <a href=\"http://www.starrywonders.com/m42new.html\">with\nOrion's</a> giant molecular cloud about\n<a href=\"ap020530.html\">1,500 light-years away</a>, but\nare dominated by the characteristic blue color of interstellar\n<a href=\"http://leo.astronomy.cz/mix/mix.html\">dust reflecting</a>\nlight from hot young stars.\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.darkskywalker.com/Photography/AstroPhotos/\ni-tnkMrws\">this sharp color image</a> a portion of the Orion Nebula appears\nalong the bottom border with the cluster\n<a href=\"ap011228.html\">of reflection nebulae</a>\nat picture center.\n\nNGC 1977 stretches across the field just below center,\nseparated from NGC 1973 (above right) and NGC 1975 (above left)\nby dark regions laced with faint red emission from\nhydrogen atoms.\n\nTaken together, the dark regions suggest to many the\nshape of <a href=\"http://rao.150m.com/NGC1977.html\">a running man</a>.",
