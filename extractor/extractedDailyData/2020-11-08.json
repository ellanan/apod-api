  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is Phobos so dark?  \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_%28moon%29\">Phobos</a>, the largest and innermost of two\nMartian moons, is the darkest moon in the entire \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nIts unusual orbit and color indicate that it may be a captured \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/overview/\">asteroid</a> composed of a mixture of ice and dark rock.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?showtopic=480&amp;st=195&amp;p=167059&amp;#entry167059\">featured picture</a> \nof Phobos near the limb of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> \nwas captured in 2010 by the robot spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMFU55V9ED_0.html\">Mars Express</a> currently orbiting Mars.  \n\n<a href=\"ap080414.html\">Phobos</a> is a heavily cratered and \n<a href=\"ap031109.html\">barren</a> moon, with its \n<a href=\"ap080410.html\">largest crater</a> located on the far side.  \n\nFrom images like this, \n<a href=\"ap061203.html\">Phobos</a> has been determined \nto be covered by perhaps a meter of \n<a href=\"ap980914.html\">loose dust</a>.  \n\nPhobos <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rxqZcO-0uI\">orbits</a> \nso close to Mars that from some places it would appear to rise and \nset twice a day, but from other places \nit would not be visible at all.  \n\n<a href=\"ap990313.html\">Phobos</a>' orbit around Mars is \ncontinually decaying -- it will likely \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.P51C1423H/abstract\">break up</a> with pieces crashing to the Martian surface in about 50 million years.",
