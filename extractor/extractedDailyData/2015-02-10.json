  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYesterday, the Sun exhibited one of the longest filaments ever recorded. \n\nIt may still be there today.\n\nVisible as the dark streak just below the center in the featured image, \nthe enormous filament extended across the face of the Sun a distance \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/96649/huge-solar-filament-stretches-across-the-sun/\">even longer</a> than the Sun's radius -- over 700,000 kilometers.\n\nA filament is actually \n<a href=\"ap120820.html\">hot gas held aloft</a> \nby the Sun's magnetic field, so that viewed from the side it would appear as a \n<a href=\"ap140304.html\">raised prominence</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://soleilhalpha.free.fr/soleil/2015/soleil_9fev_12h32tu_70.jpg\">featured image</a> shows the filament in \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomyknowhow.com/hydrogen-alpha.htm\">light emitted by hydrogen</a> and therefore highlights the \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml\">Sun's chromosphere</a>. \n\nSun-following telescopes including NASA's \n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> (SDO) are tracking \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=09&amp;month=02&amp;year=2015\">this unusual feature</a>, with SDO yesterday recording a \n<a href=\" image/1502/sunfield_sdo_960.jpg\">spiraling magnetic field</a> engulfing it. \n\nSince \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence\">filaments</a> \ntypically last only from hours to days, parts of this one may \n<a href=\"ap101215.html\">collapse</a> or \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyIxC1nJPQ0\">erupt</a> at any time, either returning hot plasma back to the Sun or \n<a href=\"ap110307.html\">expelling it</a> into the Solar System. \n\nIs the filament still there? \n\nYou can check by clicking on \n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_0304.jpg\">SDO's current solar image</a>.",
