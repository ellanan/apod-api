  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you saw a total solar eclipse, would you do a double-take?\n\nOne astrophotographer did just that -- but it took a lake and a bit of planning.\n\nRealizing that the eclipse would be low on the horizon, he looked for a suitable place along the \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2019Jul02Tgoogle.html\">thin swath of South America</a> that would see, for a few minutes, \nthe Moon completely block the Sun, both directly and in reflection. \n\nThe day before totality, he visited an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina\">Argentine</a>\nlake called \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36UAQ66ksiw\">La Cuesta Del Viento</a> \n(The Slope of the Wind) and, despite its name, found so little wind that the lake looked like a mirror.  \n<a href=\"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/5qgAAOSwoBtW3zvq/s-l300.jpg\">Perfect</a>. \n\nReturning the day of the eclipse, though, there was a strong breeze  \n<a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/wavesinocean.html\">churning up the water</a> -- enough to ruin the eclipse reflection shot. \n\n<a href=\"http://beta.ems.ladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/95450d825cf1601cba92ff3545a6be01.png\">Despair</a>. But wait! \n\nStrangely, about an hour before \n<a href=\"ap170912.html\">totality</a>, the wind died down. \n\nThis calmness may have been related to the eclipse itself, because \n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-08-mystery-eclipse-years.html\">eclipsed ground heats the air less</a> and reduces the amount rising warm air -- \nwhich can dampen and even change the wind direction. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap190705.html\">eclipse came</a>, \nhis tripod and camera were ready, and so was the lake.\n\nThe featured image of this \n<a href=\"ap150322.html\">double-eclipse</a> came from a single exposure lasting just one fifteenth of a second.\n\nSoon after \n<a href=\"ap170820.html\">totality</a>, \nthe winds returned and the water again became choppy.\n\nNo matter -- this double-image of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_July_2,_2019\">2019 July total solar eclipse</a> had been captured forever.",
