  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOn Monday, part of the Sun went missing.  \n\nThe missing piece was no cause for concern -- the Moon was only momentarily in the way.  \n\nThe event was not a \n\n<a href=\"ap050407.html\">total eclipse</a> of the Sun for any Earth-bound sky enthusiast \nbut rather, at best, an \n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">annular eclipse</a>, where the \n<a href=\"ap040926.html\">Moon blocked</a> most of the Sun.  \n\nBecause of the relatively large distance to the Moon during this \nEarth-Moon-Sun alignment, the Moon did not have a large enough \n<a href=\"http://www.1728.org/angsize.htm\">angular size</a> to block the \n<a href=\"ap010408.html\">entire Sun</a>.  \n\nThose who witnessed the solar eclipse from a \n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEmono/ASE2005/ASE2005.html\">narrow path</a> through \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/po.html\">Portugal</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sp.html\">Spain</a> and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a>, \nhowever, were lucky enough to see the coveted \n<a href=\"ap020610.html\">Ring of Fire</a>, a dark Moon completely surrounded \nby the brilliant light of the distant Sun.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.photomeeting.de/astromeeting/_index.htm\">Pictured above</a> is a \n<a href=\"ap030605.html\">Ring of Fire</a> captured two days ago in unusually \nhigh resolution above Spain.  \n\nThe resulting image shows details of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_%28solar_physics%29\">granular</a> solar surface as well as many \n<a href=\"ap040330.html\">prominences</a> around the Sun.",
