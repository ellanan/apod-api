  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt is one of the largest and longest lived storms ever recorded in our Solar System.  \n\nFirst seen late last year, the <a href=\"http://www.ciclops.org/index/6967/The_Saturn_Storm_Chronicles\">above cloud formation</a> in the northern hemisphere of Saturn started larger than the Earth and\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--YJcJrDYnM\">soon spread</a> completely around the planet.\n\nThe storm has been tracked not only\n<a href=\"ap110317.html\">from Earth</a> but from\n<a href=\"ap110119.html\">up close</a> by the robotic\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Saturn.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12829\">Pictured above</a> in false colored infrared in February, orange colors indicate\n<a href=\"ap110708.html\">clouds deep</a> in the atmosphere, while light colors highlight clouds higher up.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\">rings of Saturn</a> are seen nearly edge-on as the thin blue horizontal line.\n\nThe warped dark bands are the\n<a href=\"ap111012.html\">shadows of the rings</a> cast onto the cloud tops by the Sun to the upper left.\n\nA source of radio noise from\n<a href=\"ap100419.html\">lightning</a>, the\n<a href=\"ap080505.html\">intense storm</a> may relate to seasonal changes as spring\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW0EsR2FBD4\">slowly emerges</a> in the north of  Saturn.",
