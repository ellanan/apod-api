  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhich way to the interstate?  \nWhat appears to be a caricature of a \ncomplex highway system on Earth\nis actually a system of ridges and \ncracks on the icy surface of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>'s moon \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/eng/europa.htm\">Europa</a>. The distance between parallel ridges in the <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA01178\">above photograph</a> is typically about 1 kilometer.  \n\nThe complexity of the \n<a href=\"ap961022.html\">cracks and ridges</a> \ntell a story of \n<a href=\"ap961120.html\">Europa</a>'s past \nthat is mostly undecipherable -- planetary geologists \ntry to understand just the general origin of \nthe overall features.  \n\nOne noteworthy feature is the overall white sheen, \npossibly indicating the presence of frost.  \n\nAnother is the dark centers between parallel ridges, \nwhich might indicate that dirty water from an \n<a href=\"ap970409.html\">underground ocean</a> \nrecently welled up in the cracks and froze.",
