  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever seen an aurora?  \n\nAuroras are occurring again with increasing frequency.\n\nWith the Sun being \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/01apr_deepsolarminimum/\">unusually dormant</a> over the past three years, the amount of Sun-induced auroras has also been unusually low.\n\nMore <a href=\"ap100806.html\">recently</a>, however, our Sun has become increasingly active and \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/79389/breathtaking-recent-aurora-images-from-earth-and-space/\">exhibiting</a> a greater abundance of \n<a href=\"ap051106.html\">sunspots</a>, \n<a href=\"ap031029.html\">flares</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">coronal mass ejections</a>.\n\nSolar activity \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/aurora/gallery_01nov10.htm\">like this</a> typically expels charged particles into the Solar System, some of which may trigger \n<a href=\"http://odin.gi.alaska.edu/FAQ/\">Earthly auroras</a>.\n\nAs this year unfolded, the \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16917950\">above timelapse displays</a> \nof picturesque auroras were \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tittentem/4501029462/meta/\">captured</a> above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8\">Troms�</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap050807.html\">Curtains</a> of auroral light, usually green, \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icugqEEOgkg\">flow</a>, \n<a href=\"ap100917.html\">shimmer</a> and \n<a href=\"ap070715.html\">dance</a> as \nenergetic particles fall toward the Earth and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization\">ionize</a> \nair molecules high up in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWith <a href=\"ap071203.html\">solar maximum</a> still in the future, there may be opportunities to see spectacular \n<a href=\"http://www.ips.gov.au/Solar/1/3\">aurora</a> personally over the next three years.",
