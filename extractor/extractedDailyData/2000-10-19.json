  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt happened so far away that common human \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_02.htm\">distance measures</a> are inadequate to describe it.  \n\nFurthermore, astronomers do not even claim to know \nexactly what happened.  \n\nWhat is known is that \n<a href=\"http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/\">satellites across our Solar System</a> reported on \n2000 January 31 a tremendous explosion of \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/gamma.html\">gamma rays</a> had occurred towards some previously \nuninteresting direction.  \n\nSoon one of the largest optical telescopes on Earth, a \n<a href=\"ap990309.html\">VLT</a> in Chile, \nbegan to peer in the direction of the \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/0797issue/0797fishman.html\">gamma ray burst</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/projects/vlti/\">VLT</a> \nnot only recorded an \n<a href=\"ap970407.html\">optical counterpart</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb000131/\">shown above</a>, but also was \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-20-00.html\">able to estimate</a> that the cosmologically-induced \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~jh8h/glossary/redshift.htm\">redshift</a> was an astonishing 4.5 -- \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0010322\">placing GRB000131</a> farther across the universe \nthan any explosion so measured.  \n\nThis vast distance indicates that GRB000131 occurred \njust as galaxies like our \n<a href=\"milky_way.html\">Milky Way</a> were forming, \nand so qualifies \n<a href=\"ap000628.html\">gamma ray bursts</a> \nas unique probes of this \n<a href=\"http://athena.ph.ic.ac.uk/papers/coldgas/node3.html\">ancient epoch</a>.  \n\nThis result bodes well for the recently launched \n<a href=\"ap001012.html\">HETE-2 satellite</a>, \nwhich may record and help place more explosions in this \n<a href=\"ap000419.html\">distant</a> and \n<a href=\"ap970821.html\">mysterious time-period</a> of our universe.",
