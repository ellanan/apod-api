  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis nebula had never been noted before.\n\nNewly discovered nebulas are usually angularly small \nand found by professionals using large telescopes.\n\nIn contrast, the \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/idmd45/B/\">Pistachio Nebula</a> was \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qhH_jQciyhE\">discovered by dedicated amateurs</a> \nand, although faint, is nearly the size of the full Moon. \n\nIn modern times, amateurs with even small telescopes \ncan create long exposures over sky areas much larger than most professional telescopes can see. \n\nThey can therefore discover both \n<a href=\"https://cdn.petcarerx.com/blog/wp-content-uploads-2015-07-surprise-dog.jpg\">previously unknown</a> areas of \n<a href=\"ap230117.html\">extended emission</a> around known objects, \nas well as \n<a href=\"ap160725.html\">entirely unknown</a> objects, like nebulas. \n\nThe pictured Pistachio Nebula is shown in \n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2491/10-interesting-things-about-air/\">oxygen</a> emission (blue) and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> emission (red). \n\nThe nature of the hot central star is currently unknown, \nand the nebula might be labeled a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> \nif it turns out to be a \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_734.html\">white dwarf star</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/idmd45/\">featured image</a> \nis a composite of over 70 hours of exposure taken in early June under the dark skies of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia\">Namibia</a>.",
