  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDo stars appear dimmer when nearer the horizon?\n\nYes -- atmospheric air absorbs and reradiates light, so that the greater the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airmass\">airmass</a> through which\none peers, the fainter an object will appear.\n\nPictured above in a multi-frame image, stars, the planet \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">Jupiter</a>, and even the Moon show the \nhorizon-dimming effects of Earth's nearly-transparent atmosphere.  \n\nThe image was taken in the evening about three weeks ago over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong\">Hong Kong</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China\">China</a>.\n\nThe brightest streak near the center is the \n<a href=\"ap020921.html\">setting Moon</a>, \nwhile intermittent thin clouds sometimes dispersed moonlight into a \n<a href=\"ap081207.html\">larger halo</a>.\n\nJupiter sets just to the Moon's right.\n\nThe dim steaks cutting across the image horizontally were caused by \n<a href=\"ap010129.html\">passing airplanes</a>.\n\nThe bright strange multi-pronged streak over the house is a helicopter taking off.\n\nAn astute observer will also notice faint rays emanating from near the horizon.  \n\nTheir cause is unknown, but may be \n<a href=\"ap050831.html\">crepuscular rays</a> caused by the Sun shining through gaps in thick clouds.",
