  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes you just have to stop and watch the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/\nmeteorites.html\">meteors</a>.  \n\nIn the early morning hours of November 18, \na band of eleven people searched for a flat \nand cloudless site to see the \n<a href=\"http://SpaceWeather.com/meteors/gallery_18nov01.html\">2001 Leonids Meteor Shower</a>.  \n\nStarting in central \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ia.us/\">Iowa</a>, weather \nsatellite images indicated that southern \n<a href=\"http://www.state.mn.us/\">Minnesota</a> might \nbe their best chance, and so off they drove.  \n\nAlthough they couldn't shake off all of the clouds, \nthey found a dark gravel road, pulled off, \nand settled in for the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?2001+Leonids\">rare celestial light show</a>.  \n\n\"By about 4 am, we were visually counting 1000 per hour. \nAfter that they started to increase dramatically.\"  \n\nThe photographer was just a little too late to catch a \n<a href=\"ap011119.html\">really bright fireball</a>, \nbut did catch several other bright \n<a href=\"http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/leonids.html\">Leonid meteors</a> above one of the cars in the convoy.  \n\nThe exposure lasted a few minutes.",
