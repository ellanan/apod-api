  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis big, bright, beautiful spiral galaxy is\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m064.html\">Messier 64</a>,\noften called the Black Eye Galaxy or the\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nbib_query?1994AJ....107..173R\">Sleeping Beauty Galaxy</a>\nfor its heavy-lidded appearance in telescopic views.\n\nM64 is about 17 million light-years distant in the\notherwise well-groomed northern constellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/com/index.html\">Coma\nBerenices</a>.\n\nIn fact, the Red Eye Galaxy might also be an appropriate moniker\nin this colorful composition.\n\nThe enormous dust clouds obscuring the near-side of\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/04/caption.html\">M64's central\nregion</a> are laced with the\ntelltale reddish glow of hydrogen associated with star forming\nregions.  \n\nBut they are not this galaxy's only peculiar feature.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/04/\nsupplemental.html\">Observations show</a> that M64 is actually\ncomposed of two concentric, counter-rotating systems.\n\nWhile all the stars in M64 rotate in the same direction as the\ninterstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, gas in the outer\nregions, extending to about 40,000 light-years, rotates in\nthe opposite direction.\n\nThe dusty eye and bizarre rotation are likely the result of a\nbillion year old\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/main.html\">merger</a>\nof two different galaxies.",
