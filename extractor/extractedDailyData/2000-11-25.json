  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLike a fleet of futuristic starcruisers,\nNASA's highly successful series of\n<a href=\"http://www.friends-partners.org/~mwade/craft/heao.htm\">High Energy Astrophysical Observatory (HEAO) spacecraft</a>\nappear poised over planet Earth.\n\nLabeled A, B, and C in this vintage illustration,\nthe spacebased telescopes were known as\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heao1/\nheao1_images.html\">HEAO-1</a>,\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/einstein/\nheao2_images.html\">HEAO-2</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heao3/\nheao3_images.html\">HEAO-3</a> respectively.\n\nHEAO-1 and HEAO-2 were responsible for revealing to earthlings\nthe wonders of\n<a href=\"ap960102.html\">the x-ray sky</a>, discovering 1,000s of celestial\nsources of high-energy radiation.\n\nHEAO-2, also known\nas the <a href=\"ap000108.html\">Einstein</a>\nObservatory, was launched in November 1978, near the\ndate of the famous physicist's 100th birthday\nand was the first large,\nfully imaging x-ray telescope in space.\n\nHEAO-3, the last in the series,\nwas launched in 1979 and measured high energy\n<a href=\"ap961016.html\">cosmic-ray particles</a>\nand <a href=\"ap980321.html\">gamma-rays</a>.\n\nThese satellite observatories were roughly 18 feet long and weighed\nabout 7,000 pounds.  Their missions completed, all have fallen from orbit\nand <a href=\"ap950709.html\">burned up harmessly in the atmosphere</a>.",
