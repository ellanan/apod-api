  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's a Wolf-Rayet star, and how did it create that spherical bubble and\nsweeping arc?  A\n<a href=\"http://www.webhead.com/~sergio/hot/bibli/\">Wolf-Rayet \nstar</a> is a star that originated with a\n<a href=\"http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/astro2/astro2_science/wr.html\">mass over 40 times</a> that of our \n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>.\nAn extremely\n<a href=\"http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/q29.html\">hot, luminous star</a>,\nit has since expelled shells of material through its strong \n<a href=\"http://yan.open.ac.uk/~rogley/wind_accretion.html\">stellar \nwind</a> which could account for the\n<a href=\"http://ast1.spa.umn.edu/Bubbles/WRAspherical/project.html\">bubble shaped nebula</a> that surrounds it.\nBut <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?1995ApJ%2E%2E%2E438%2E%2E950C&amp;db_key=AST\">astronomers are unsure how the central Wolf-Rayet \ncreated both the bubble and the arc</a> seen above, and\neven whether it acted alone in doing so. Together, this bubble and the arc\nare known as <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1980S%26T%2E%2E%2E%2E59%2E%2E195S&amp;db_key=AST\">NGC 2359</a>.",
