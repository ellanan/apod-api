  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nY Canum Venaticorum (Y CVn) is a very rare star\nin planet Earth's night sky.\n\nIt's also very red, exhibiting such a remarkable spectrum\nof light, 19th century astronomer\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Secchi\">Angelo\nSecchi</a> dubbed it\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/lasuperba.html\">La Superba</a>.\n\nLocated 710 light-years away in northern constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici\">Canes Venatici</a>\n(the Hunting Dogs), the star varies in brightness over\na period of about half a year.\n\nNear maximum, it becomes just bright enough to see with the\nunaided eye, but the star's beautiful red hue is\n<a href=\"http://www.backyard-astro.com/deepsky/top100/11.html\">easy\nto see</a> in binoculars or a small telescope.\n\nIn fact, La Superba is among the brightest of the\n<a href=\"ap010304.html\">carbon stars</a> -\ncool, highly evolved\n<a href=\"http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec16.html\">red\ngiant stars</a> with exceptional abundances of carbon.\n\nThe carbon is <a href=\"http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/\ncourses/astro201/helium_burn.htm\">created</a>\nby helium fusion near the stellar core\n<a href=\"http://web.missouri.edu/~speckan/witch-stuff/Research/\nchapter2/node13.html\">and dredged up</a> into the stars' outer layers.\n\nThe resulting overabundance of simple carbon molecules\n(like CO, CN, C2) in the atmospheres of carbon stars strongly absorbs\nbands of bluer light and gives these stars a deep red color.\n\nLa Superba is losing its carbon-rich atmosphere\ninto the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.4211\">surrounding</a>\ninterstellar material through a strong stellar wind,\nand could be near the beginning of <a href=\"ap040513.html\">a transition</a>\nto a <a href=\"ap081217.html\">planetary nebula</a> phase.",
