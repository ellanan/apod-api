  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nFrom fifty kilometers above asteroid \n<a href=\"ap090607.html\">Eros</a>, \nthe surface inside one of its largest craters \nappears covered with an unusual substance: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith\">regolith</a>. \n\nThe thickness and composition of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWg2k0W_Kwo\">the surface</a> \ndust that is \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998DPS....30.0703C\">regolith</a> remains a topic of much research.  \n\nMuch of the regolith on \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/eros/sum.html\">433 Eros</a> was probably created by numerous small \nimpacts during its long history.  \n\nIn <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02950\">this representative-color view</a> taken by the \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/spacecraft/\">robot spacecraft NEAR-SHOEMAKER</a> that \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/intro/faq.html\">orbited Eros</a> in 2000 and 2001, brown areas indicate \n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/iod/20000713/\">regolith</a> that has been chemically altered by exposure to the \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">solar wind</a> during \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeorite\">micrometeorite</a> impacts.  \n\nWhite areas are thought to have undergone relatively less exposure.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap000824.html\">boulders visible</a> \ninside the crater appear brown, \nindicating either that they are old enough to have a \nsurface itself tanned by the \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">solar wind</a>, or that they have somehow become \ncovered with some dark surface \n<a href=\"ap011110.html\">dust</a>.\n\nThis July, NASA's\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/dawn/news/\ndawn20110613.html\">Dawn spacecraft\nwill orbit</a> giant main belt asteroid Vesta.",
