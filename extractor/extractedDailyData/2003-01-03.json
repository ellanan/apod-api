  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNot so long ago and not so far, far away, a\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2002/16/\">galaxy\nwas born</a>.\n\nSeen in this Hubble Space Telescope image, the\n<a href=\"ap020518.html\">island universe</a> of\nstars, gas, and dust cataloged as POX 186 is a mere 68 million\nlight-years distant toward an uncrowded region in the\nconstellation Virgo.\n\nPOX 186 is truly <a href=\"ap001023.html\">dwarfed by</a>\ngalaxies like our own Milky Way.\n\nThe diminutive galaxy is about 900 light-years across with around 10\nmillion stars, compared to the <a href=\"http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/\nask/a11372.html\">Milky Way's</a> 100,000 light-year span and\nmore than <a href=\"http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/\ngalaxy.html\">200 billion stars</a>.\n\nCosmically speaking, <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/\n2002/16/fastfacts\">POX 186 is</a>\nalso very young as the Hubble snapshot\nreveals a disturbed galaxy that is likely\n<a href=\"ap020506.html\">the result</a> of a 100 million\nyear old <a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/\nquestion.php?number=354\">collision</a> between two even smaller\nstar systems.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0208369\">POX 186 observations</a>\nsuggest that such isolated, small\ngalaxies may be the last to form, since the most massive\n<a href=\"http://origins.stsci.edu/under/galaxies.shtml\">galaxies\nin the universe</a> seem to have formed billions of years ago.",
