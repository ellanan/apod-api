  "title": "A Total Eclipse of the Sun",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn February 26th, it was dark during the day.  This <a href=\"http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/eclipse/eclipse.htm\">total solar eclipse</a> was the last visible from the Americas\nfor this millennium.\n\nA <a href=\"ap980227.html\">total solar eclipse</a> is \nexciting partly because it is so short.\n\nWere \n<a href=\"ap971026.html\">Earth</a>'s <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html\">Moon</a> farther away, no total eclipse \nwould occur at all because the Moon \nwould appear too small to block out all of the \n<a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>.  \n\nWere the Moon much closer to the Earth, \nthe eclipse would last much longer.  \n\nOddly, the Sun and Moon have almost \nexactly the same <a href=\"http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/Course/Bernstein101/Geometry/\ngeom.html#angularsize\">angular size</a>.\n\nEven for\n<a href=\"ap970827.html\">well located</a> observers, this\ncreates at most only a \nvery few minutes of totality\nbefore the <a href=\"ap951024.html\">Moon's shadow</a> moves away.  \n\nDuring a\n<a href=\"http://planets.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/TSE1999/TSE1999.html\">total solar eclipse</a> in 1919,\nthese few minutes were long enough for scientists to \ndetermine that the <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/EinsteinTest.html\">Sun's gravity bends light</a> from the stars behind it, \ndramatically confirming the accuracy of a \n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/General_relativity.html\">new theory of gravity</a> postulated over 80 years ago.",
