  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nJupiter looks a bit different in infrared light.\n\nTo better understand \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a>'s cloud motions and to help NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html\">Juno</a> spacecraft understand the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPwiUldgps\">planetary context</a> of the small fields that it sees, the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> is being directed to \n<a href=\"ap151024.html\">regularly image</a> the entire Jovian giant.\n\nThe colors of Jupiter \n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=14661\">being monitored</a> go beyond the normal human visual range to include both \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet</a> and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> light. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/26039176678/in/dateposted/\">Featured here</a> in 2016, three bands of <a href=\"http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/~tt/Lectures/Galaxies/Images/Infrared/Regions/irregions.html\">near-infrared</a> light have been digitally reassigned into a mapped color image. \n\n<a href=\"ap081106.html\">Jupiter appears</a> \n<a href=\"https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/image385.html\">different in infrared</a> \npartly because the amount of sunlight reflected back is distinct, \ngiving differing cloud heights and latitudes discrepant brightnesses.\n\nNevertheless, many familiar features on \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter\">Jupiter</a> remain, including the  \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Zones,_belts_and_jets\">light zones and dark belts</a> that circle the planet near the equator, the \n<a href=\"ap140518.html\">Great Red Spot</a> on the lower left, and the \n<a href=\"https://astronomynow.com/2017/06/26/jupiters-string-of-pearls/\">string-of-pearls</a> storm systems south of the Great Red Spot. \n\nThe poles glow because high altitude haze there is energized by charged \nparticles from Jupiter's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere\">magnetosphere</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/\">Juno</a> has now completed \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/juno-completes-tenth-science-orbit\">10</a> of 12 planned science orbits of Jupiter and continues to record data that are helping humanity to \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html\">understand</a> not only Jupiter's weather but \n<a href=\"ap171214.html\">what lies beneath</a> Jupiter's thick clouds.",
