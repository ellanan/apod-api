  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nComet McNaught was perhaps the most photogenic comet of modern times -- from Earth.  \n\nAfter making \n<a href=\"ap070115.html\">quite a show</a> in the northern hemisphere in early January of 2007, \nthe comet moved south and developed a \n<a href=\"ap070122.html\">long and unusual dust tail</a> that \n<a href=\"ap070205.html\">dazzled southern hemisphere observers</a>.\n\nIn late January 2007, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_McNaught\">Comet McNaught</a> \nwas captured between Mount Remarkable and Cecil Peak in this \n<a href=\"http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~mkyoneto/star/mcnaught.htm\">spectacular image</a>\ntaken from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown%2C_New_Zealand\">Queenstown</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island\">South Island</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a>.   \n\nThe bright comet dominates the right part of the \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/mcnaught/28jan07/Yoneto1.jpg\">above image</a>, while the \n<a href=\"ap050605.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/milky_way_galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \ndominates the left.  \n\nCareful inspection of the image will reveal a \n<a href=\"ap011111.html\">meteor streak</a> just to the left of the comet. \n\nToday, \n<a href=\"http://www.livecometdata.com/comets/c2013-a1-siding-spring/\">Comet Siding Spring</a> may become the most photogenic comet of modern times -- from Mars.",
