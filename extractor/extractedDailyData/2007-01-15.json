  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis past weekend Comet McNaught peaked at a brightness that surpassed even Venus. \n\nFascinated sky enthusiasts in the Earth's northern hemisphere were treated to an \n<a href=\"ap070113.html\">instantly visible</a> comet head and a faint elongated tail \nnear sunrise and sunset.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/icq/CometMags.html#2006P1\">Recent brightness estimates</a> had \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_McNaught\">Comet McNaught</a> \nbrighter than \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/stars/magnitudes.html\">magnitude</a> -5 (minus five) over this past weekend, making it the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/icq/brightest.html\">brightest comet</a> since \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikeya-Seki\">Comet Ikeya-Seki</a> in 1965, \nwhich was recorded at -7 (minus seven).\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Comet\">Great Comet</a> of 2007 \nreached its brightest as it rounded the Sun well inside the orbit of Mercury.\n\nOver the next week \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006p1.html\">Comet McNaught</a> \nwill begin to fade as it moves south and away from the Sun.  \n\nThe unexpectedly bright comet \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2006P1_1.html\">should remain visible</a> to \n<a href=\"http://www.assa.org.au/sig/comets/mcnaught.asp\">observers in the southern hemisphere</a> with unaided \neyes for the rest of January.  \n\nThe above image, vertically compressed, was taken at sunset last Friday from \n<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Castelltallat_14_gener_2006_002.JPG\">mountains</a> above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia\">Catalonia</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.",
