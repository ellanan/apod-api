  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt may appear to be day, but it's night.  \n\nThose wondrous orange streaks may appear to be\n<a href=\"ap081116.html\">rays</a> from the setting Sun,\nbut they're actually thin clouds\n<a href=\"ap070203.html\">illuminated by the Moon</a>\nas they quickly streaked toward the distant horizon.\n\nThe thick clouds on the far left may appear to have many layers,\nbut actually they are just a few\n<a href=\"http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadFAQ/BadCloudsFAQ.html\">simple clouds</a> captured on numerous separate exposures.  \n\nWhat is surely true, though, is that the\n<a href=\"http://www.greeksky.gr/files/photos/landscapes/20100228Trails2.htm\">above time lapse image sequence</a> was taken over two hours,\nabout two weeks ago, in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion\">Sounio</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>.  \n\nAlso, those really are <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYy0EQBnqHI\">star trails</a> swirling around the north star\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/polaris.html\">Polaris</a>\non the upper right of the image.  \n\nBut what about the building in the foreground?  \n\nIt may appear to be a <a href=\"ap081221.html\">famous ancient structure</a>, but it's actually a small deserted church built only last century.",
