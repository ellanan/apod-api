  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nEleven years ago the <a href=\"ap970124.html\">brightest \nsupernova of modern times</a> \nwas recorded.  Now the expanding debris from this \ntremendous stellar explosion is seen to be \ncrashing into \n<a href=\"ap970812.html\">previously expelled material</a>.  \nThe onset of this collision is shown by the arrow in the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/08/\">above picture</a> as the yellow spot on the interior of the ring.  \nAlthough the collision is occurring at speeds near \n60 million km/hour, it will appear to take years due \nto the vast distances involved.  As the \n<a href=\"http://www.aspsky.org/html/tnl/08/08.html\">supernova</a> blast wave moves out, it \n<a href=\"http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~greg/Lab/thegun.html\">shock-heats</a> any gas it encounters, causing it to glow.  \nAstronomers are thus hopeful that the blast wave will \nilluminate the interesting past of <a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/StarDeath/sn1987a.html\">SN 1987a</a>, and perhaps provide more clues \nabout the origins of the\n<a href=\"ap960705.html\">mysterious rings</a>.",
