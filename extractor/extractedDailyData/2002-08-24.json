  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe complex shell of a star seen to explode \n300 years ago is helping astronomers to \nunderstand how that star exploded.  \n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2002/0237/index.html\">This\nChandra Observatory image</a> of supernova remnant \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/Vars/\ncasA.html\">Cassiopeia A</a> (Cas A) shows unprecedented detail in three \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/\nxrays.html\">x-ray</a> colors.  \n\nThe relationship between brightness, color, \nand position of material in the image indicates \nwhere in the star this material was just before \nthe explosion.  \n\nBright knots on the left, for example, contain little iron, \nand so are <a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/\n9910474\">hypothesized</a> to originate from a higher layer \nthan outer red filaments, which are <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/\nProjects/Chemcomics/html/iron.html\">iron</a> rich.  \n\nThe blue region on the right is seen through absorbing \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a>, \nand so appears depleted of low-energy x-rays. \n\nIt takes light ten years to cross the gas shell of the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacescience.com/newhome/headlines/\nast21dec99_1.htm\">Cas A supernova remnant</a>, which is 10,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\ncosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> distant.\n\nMost of the \n<a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/Projects/Chemcomics/index.html\">elements</a> \nthat make people and planets were produced in \n<a href=\"http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova explosions</a>.",
