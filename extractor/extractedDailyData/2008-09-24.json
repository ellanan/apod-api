  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy has the Sun been so quiet recently?\n\nNo one is sure.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Our Sun</a>\nhas shown few active regions -- that house even fewer associated\n<a href=\"ap051106.html\">sunspots</a> --\nfor over a year now, and such a\nperiod of relative calm is quite unusual.\n\nWhat is well known is that our Sun is in\na transitional period between\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle\">solar cycles</a> called a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_minimum\">Solar Minimum</a>,\nwhere solar activity has historically been reduced.\n\nThe stark lack of surface tumult is unusual even during a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/06mar_solarminimum.html\">Solar Minimum</a>, however, and activity\nthis low has not been seen for many\ndecades.\n\nA few days ago, however, a\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/2008/09/22/solar-cycle-24-sunspots-finally-say-hello/\">bona-fide\nactive region</a> -- complete with sunspots\n--appeared and continues to\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dfKoPsA8KQ\">rotate</a> across\nthe Sun's face.\n\nVisible above, this region, dubbed\n<a href=\"ap020801.html\">Active Region</a> 1002 (AR 1002), was imaged in\n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/uv.html\">ultraviolet light</a> yesterday by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory\">SOHO spacecraft</a>, which co-orbits the Sun\nnear the Earth.\n\n\nBesides the\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/11jul_solarcycleupdate.htm\">tranquility</a> on the Sun's surface, recent data from the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(spacecraft)\">Ulysses spacecraft</a>, across the Solar System,\n<a href=\"http://www.swri.org/press/2008/Ulysses.htm\">indicate</a> that the intensity of the \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml\">solar wind</a> blowing out from the Sun is at a fifty\nyear low.\n\nPredictions hold, however, that our Sun\nwill show more and more\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Q2O1ziheE\">active region</a>s\ncontaining more and more sunspots and flares until\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum\">Solar Maximum</a> occurs in about four years.",
