  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening at the edge of the Sun?\n\nAlthough it may look like a \n<a href=\"ap101018.html\">monster is rampaging</a>, \nwhat is pictured is actually only a monster prominence -- a sheath of thin gas held above the surface by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun\">Sun's magnetic field</a>.\n\nThe solar event was captured just this past weekend with a small telescope, with the resulting image then \n<a href=\"http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/81.gif\">inverted</a> and \n<a href=\"http://adsoftheworld.com/sites/default/files/Blue_Cat-No_Mac-big.jpg\">false-colored</a>.\n\nAs indicated with illustrative lines, the \n<a href=\"ap100418.html\">prominence</a> \nrises over 50,000 kilometers above the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere\">Sun's surface</a>, \nmaking even our 12,700-diameter \n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a> seem \n<a href=\"ap140304.html\">small by comparison</a>.\n\nBelow the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/News022411-monsterprom.html\">monster prominence</a> is \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/images2016/11sep16/hmi1898.gif\">active region 12585</a>, \nwhile light colored filaments can be seen hovering over a flowing \n<a href=\"ap120314.html\">solar carpet</a> of fibrils.\n\nFilaments are actually prominences seen against the disk of the Sun, while similarly, fibrils are actually <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4404\">spicules</a> \nseen against the disk. \n\nEnergetic events like this are becoming less common as the Sun evolves toward a minimum in its \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml\">11-year activity cycle</a>.",
