  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLocated 20,000 light-years away in the constellation Carina,\nthe young cluster and starforming region\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2015/12/\">Westerlund 2 fills this cosmic scene</a>.\n\nCaptured with Hubble's cameras in near-infrared and visible light,\nthe stunning image is a\n<a href=\"http://hubble25th.org/\">celebration of the 25th anniversary</a>\nof the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope on April 24, 1990.\n\nThe cluster's dense concentration of luminous, massive stars is about\n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/\nhs-2015-12-g-compass_large_web.jpg\">10 light-years across</a>.\n\nStrong winds and radiation from those massive young stars have sculpted\nand shaped the region's gas and dust,\ninto starforming pillars that point back to the central cluster.\n\nRed dots surrounding the bright stars are the cluster's\nfaint newborn stars, still within their natal gas and dust cocoons.\n\nBut brighter blue stars scattered around are likely not in the\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4309\">Westerlund 2 cluster</a>\nand instead lie in the foreground of the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/12/\nvideo/d/\">Hubble anniversary field of view</a>.",
