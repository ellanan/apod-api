  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIn buildings eight stories tall rest mirrors ten meters across that are\nslowly allowing humanity to map the universe.  Alone, each is the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/bigeyes.html\">world's\nlargest optical telescope</a>: <a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/mirror/keck/realpublic/gen_info/gen_info.html\">Keck</a>. \nTogether, the twin Keck telescopes have the\nresolving power of a single telescope 90-meter in diameter, able to discern\nsources just milliarcseconds apart.  Since \n<a href=\"http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/keck.telescope.html\">opening in 1992</a>, the real power of Keck I (left) has been in its \n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/mirror/keck/realpublic/gen_info/gen_info.html#PRIMARY\">enormous light-gathering ability</a> - allowing \n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/mirror/keck/realpublic/gen_info/gen_info.html#Science\">astronomers to study</a> <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E458%2E%2E600B&amp;db_key=AST\">faint</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/ApJ/v457n1/5613/sc0.html\">distant</a> objects in \n<a href=\"ap960213.html\">our Galaxy</a> and the universe. \nKeck II, completed last year, and its twin are located on the dormant volcano \n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_tour/hawaii/041.html\">Mauna \nKea</a>, \n<a href=\"ap951216.html\">Hawaii</a>, \n<a href=\"ap960617.html\">USA</a>. In the distance is <a href=\" http://www.maui-info.com/volcano.html\">Maui's volcano Haleakala</a>. One reason Keck was built was because of the\ndifficulty for astronomers to get funding for a smaller telescope.",
