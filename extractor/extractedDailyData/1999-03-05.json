  "title": "M46 And NGC 2438: Young And Old",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGalactic or <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html\">open star clusters</a> are relatively young.\n\nThese swarms of bright stars are born near the plane of the Milky Way,\nbut their numbers steadily dwindle as cluster members are\nstrewn through the Galaxy by gravitational interactions.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m046.html\">This bright open cluster, known as M46</a>, is around 300 million years\nyoung and still contains a few hundred stars.\n\nLocated about 5,000 light-years away toward the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/\nPuppis.html\">constellation Puppis</a>,\nM46 is a familiar object to\n<a href=\"http://www.fred.net/rick_b/\">telescopic stargazers</a>\nand also seems to contain a contradiction to its youthful status.\n\nThe striking red patch of glowing gas above center in this\n<a href=\"http://airdigital.com/\">lovely photograph</a>\nis the planetary nebula NGC 2438 - a brief,\nfinal phase in the life of a solar-type star\na few billion years old whose central reservoir of hydrogen\nfuel has been exhausted.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n2438.html\">NGC 2438</a> is estimated to be only 3,000 light-years distant and\nmoves at a different speed than M46 cluster members.\n\nIt likely represents a foreground object, only by chance appearing\nalong our line of sight to young M46.",
