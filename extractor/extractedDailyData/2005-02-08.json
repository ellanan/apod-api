  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat in heavens-above was that?  \n\nNot everything seen on the night sky is understood.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://NightSkyLive.net/\">Night Sky Live</a> \n(NSL) project keeps its global array of continuously \nupdating web cameras (CONCAMs) always watching the night sky.  \n\nOn the night of 2004 December 17, the \n<a href=\"http://www.zeta.org.au/~andrewa/ajaa31.htm\">fisheye</a> \nCONCAM perched on top of an \n<a href=\"http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanoes/haleakala/main.html\">active volcano</a> in \n<a href=\"http://NightSkyLive.net/hl/\">Haleakala</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.state.hi.us/\">Hawaii</a>, \nsaw something moving across the night sky that remains mysterious.  \n\nThe NSL team might have disregarded the above streak as unconfirmed, \nbut the <a href=\"http://NightSkyLive.net/mk/\">Mauna Kea CONCAM</a> \non the next Hawaiian island recorded the \n<a href=\"http://nightskylive.net/mk/mk041217/mk041217ut142325p.jpg\">same thing</a>.  \n\nThe NSL team might then have disregarded the streak as a satellite, \nbut no record of it was found in the \n<a href=\"http://www.heavens-above.com/\">heavens-above.com</a> \nsite that usually documents bright satellite events. \n\nIf you think you have a \n<a href=\"http://badastronomy.com/bad/misc/index.html\">reasonable explanation</a> for the streak, \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?t=291\">please contribute to the on-line discussion</a>.  \n\nCurrent candidates include a <a href=\"ap991022.html\">known satellite</a> that was somehow missed by \n<a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/\">heavens-above</a>, \na recently <a href=\"ap041212.html\">launched rocket</a>, and a \n<a href=\"ap031015.html\">passing space</a> rock.  \n\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?t=385\">Volunteers are solicited</a> by the NSL project to help \nmonitor the operability of each NSL CONCAM, \nincluding looking for \n<a href=\"ap041207.html\">interesting anomalies</a> such as this.\n\n<i> Disclosure: </i> <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn.html\">Robert Nemiroff</a> collaborates on both the\n<a href=\"http://NightSkyLive.net/\">NSL</a> and\n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/\">APOD</a> projects.",
