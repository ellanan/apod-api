  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap131216.html\">Tracks lead</a> to a small robot perched\nnear the top of this bright little planet.\n\nOf course, the planet is really the Moon.\n\nThe robot is the desk-sized Yutu rover, leaving its\nlooming Chang'e 3 lander\nafter a mid-December 2013 touch down in\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/\nnasas-lunar-reconnaissance-orbiter-views-change-lunar-rover-landing-site/\">\nthe northern Mare Imbrium</a>.\n\nThe little planet projection is a digitally warped and stitched\nmosaic of images from the\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2016/\n01281656-fun-with-a-new-data-set-change.html\">lander's terrain camera</a>\ncovering 360 by 180 degrees.\n\nUltimately traveling over 100 meters, Yutu came to a halt in January 2014.\n\nThe lander's <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04287\">instruments</a>\nare still working though, after more than two years on the\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151222/ncomms9880/full/\nncomms9880.html\">lunar surface</a>.\n\nMeanwhile, an interactive panoramic version of this little planet\n<a href=\"https://www.360cities.net/image/\nlunar-panorama-change-3-lander\">is available here.</a>",
