  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://astrodrudis.com/ngc-1360-the-robins-egg-nebula/\">This\npretty cosmic cloud</a> lies some 1,500 light-years away,\nit shape and color reminiscent of a blue robin's egg.\n\nIt spans about 3 light-years, nested securely within the\nboundaries of the southern constellation Fornax.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/\nimage_feature_2395.html\">Recognized as</a>\na planetary nebula, NGC 1360 doesn't represent a beginning\nthough.\n\nInstead it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the\nevolution of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nStellar_evolution#Mature_stars\">aging star</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10891\">In fact</a>,\nvisible in the telescopic image the central star of NGC 1360\nis known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two\nevolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun. \n\nTheir intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has\nstripped away electrons from the atoms in the surrounding gaseous shroud.\n\nThe predominant blue-green hue of NGC 1360 seen here is the\nstrong emission produced as electrons recombine with\ndoubly ionized oxygen atoms.",
