  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the sky lights up unexpectedly.\n\nA trip to northern Norway to photograph \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/aurora-index.html\">auroras</a> was not going as well as hoped.\n\nIt was now past midnight in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordreisa\">Steinsvik</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms\">Troms</a>, in northern \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a>, and the date was 2014 February 8. \n\nDespite \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=08&amp;month=02&amp;year=2014\">recent activity</a> on the Sun, the skies were \n<a href=\"http://www.shizarium.ru/wp-content/gallery/animals5/34520-114759-ba1d04b3a7e17d10d0a272533ca71316.jpg\">disappointing</a>.\n\nTherefore, the astrophotographer began packing up to go.\n\nHis brother began searching for a missing lens cap.\n\nWhen the sky suddenly exploded with \n<a href=\"ap141103.html\">spectacular aurora</a>.\n\nReacting quickly, \n<a href=\"http://www.tommyrichardsen.com/Store/Nightscapes/i-27DK9gn\">a sequence</a> detailing dramatic \n<a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/4D.html\">green</a> curtains was captured, \nwith the bright Moon near the image center, and the lens-cap seeking brother on the far right. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap110328.html\">auroral flare</a> lasted only a few minutes, \nbut the memory of this event, the photographer speculates, will last much longer.",
