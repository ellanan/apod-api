  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis big space diamond has an \n<a href=\"http://www.asterank.com/\">estimated value</a> of over 80 billion dollars.\n\nIt's only diamond in shape, though -- \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162173_Ryugu\">asteroid 162173 Ryugu</a> \nis thought to be composed of mostly \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel\">nickel</a> and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/26.shtml\">iron</a>. \n\nAsteroids like \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/hayabusa-2/in-depth/\">Ryugu</a> are interesting for several reasons, perhaps foremost because they are near the Earth and might, one day in the far future, pose an \n<a href=\"https://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/neoshield-protecting-earth-impact-threats/\">impact threat</a>.\n\nIn the nearer term, \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/new-global-views-ryugu-20km.html\">Ryugu</a> is interesting because it may be possible to send future spacecraft there to \n<a href=\"http://theconversation.com/mining-asteroids-could-unlock-untold-wealth-heres-how-to-get-started-95675\">mine it</a>, thus providing humanity with a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_mining\">new source</a> \nof valuable metals.  \n\nScientifically, \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/?keywords=hayabusa-2\">Ryugu</a> is interesting because it carries information about how our Solar System formed billions of years ago, and why its orbit takes it \n<a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/intro.html\">so close</a> to Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>'s \nrobotic \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa2\">spacecraft Hayabusa2</a> \njust \n<a href=\"ap180625.html\">arrived</a> \nat this one-kilometer wide asteroid in late June.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/topics/20180725je/index_e.html\">featured image</a> shows surface structures unknown before spacecraft Hayabusa2's arrival, including rock fields and craters. \n\nWithin the next three months, \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2018/0525-keep-up-with-hayabusa2.html\">Hayabusa2 is scheduled</a> to unleash several probes, some that will land on Ryugu and hop around, \nwhile Hayabusa2 itself will mine just a little bit of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/small-bodies/asteroids/in-depth/\">asteroid</a> for \n<a href=\"ap090705.html\">return to Earth</a>.",
