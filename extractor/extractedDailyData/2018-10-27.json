  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap170407.html\">The best known</a>\nasterism in northern skies hangs over the Canadian\nRockies in this mountain and night skyscape taken last week from\nBanff National Park.\n\nBut most remarkable is the amazing greenish airglow.\n\nWith airglow visible to the eye, but not in color,\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpPkecTlf22/\">the scene\nwas captured</a> in two exposures with a single camera,\none exposure made while tracking the stars and one fixed to a tripod.\n\nAirglow emission is predominately from atmospheric oxygen atoms at extremely\nlow densities.\n\nCommonly recorded in color by sensitive digital cameras the eerie,\ndiffuse light is seen here in\n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/hgrav.htm\">waves across</a>\nthe northern night.\n\nOriginating at an altitude similar to aurorae, the luminous airglow is\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow2.htm\">due\nto chemiluminescence</a>, the production of light through\nchemical excitation and radiative decay.\n\nEnergy for the chemical excitation is provided during daytime by the\nSun's extreme\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet\nradiation</a>.\n\nUnlike aurorae which are limited to\n<a href=\"ap181006.html\">high latitudes</a>,\nairglow can be found\n<a href=\"ap160331.html\">around the globe</a>.",
