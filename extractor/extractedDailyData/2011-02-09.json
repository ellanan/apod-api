  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's stars versus gas mountains in NGC 2174 and the stars are winning.\n\nMore precisely, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the \n<a href=\"ap061022.html\">dark stellar nurseries</a> in which they formed.\n\nThe structures of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2174\">NGC 2174</a> are actually much thinner than air and only appear as \n<a href=\"ap100426.html\">mountains</a> due to relatively small amounts of opaque interstellar <a href=\"http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html#dust\">dust</a>.  \n\nA lesser known sight in the nebula-rich \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/orion.html\">constellation Orion</a>, NGC 2174 can be found with binoculars near the head of the celestial hunter. \n\nAbout 6,400 light-years distant, the \n<a href=\"ap061208.html\">entire glowing cosmic cloud</a> covers an area larger than the full Moon and surrounds loose \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open clusters</a> of young stars. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1106a/\">above image</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> shows a dense interior region which spans only about three light years while adopting a \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures/meaning_of_color/eagle.php\">color map</a> that portrays otherwise red hydrogen emission in green hues and emphasizes \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-XbjFn3aqE\">sulfur emission</a> \nin red and oxygen in blue.\n\nWithin a few million years, the stars will likely win out completely and the entire \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzv0TSSDgU\">dust mountain will be dispersed</a>.",
