  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is the history of the Moon?\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\">The Moon</a> was likely created from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis\">debris expelled</a> when a Mars-sized object violently\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7VOAM-rbB8\">impacted the Earth</a> about 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nJust after gravitationally condensing, as\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKmSQqp8wY\">imagined</a>\n<a href=\"http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a010900/a010930/\">above</a>, the glowing-hot surface of the Moon cooled and cracked.\n\nRocks large and small continued to impact the surface, including a particularly large impact that created\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken_basin\">Aitken Basin</a> about 4.3 billion years ago.\n\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Bombardment_Period\">Heavy Bombardment</a> period then continued for hundreds of millions of years, creating large basins all over the lunar surface.\n\nOver the next few billion years lava flowed into\n<a href=\"ap110303.html\">Earth-side basins</a>, eventually cooling into the dark maria we see today.  \n\nAs always, relentless impacts continued, forming the\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/impact_cratering.shtml\">craters</a> we see today, slowly diminishing over the past billion years.\n\nToday the cooled Moon we know and\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLfTjTLnVIo\">love</a>\nis as <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qyhZ9_eXCHM/TFiStYEuNlI/AAAAAAAAF8g/JwtiTY5H8BU/s400/coal_hands.jpg\">dark as coal</a> and always keeps the same face toward Earth.\n\nExactly how the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibV4MdN5wo0\">Moon formed</a> initially, and why\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983Natur.302..233S\">lunar maria</a> are only on the Earth side, remain active topics of research.",
