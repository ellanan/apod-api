  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if we could see back to the beginning of the universe? At one tenth the \n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletters/lpib/lpib77/black77.html\">universe's present age</a>, we might see \n<a href=\"ap970209.html\">galaxies forming</a>.  \nBut what did galaxies look like when they were forming?  \nThese questions took a step toward being answered yesterday \nwith the release of analysis of a \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST) \nphotograph of the most distant object yet discovered.  \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/25.html\">Pictured \nin the box above, this galaxy</a> appears to us - billions of years \nlater and across the universe - as a faint red smudge.  In technical terms, \nthis galaxy lies at the record \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#redshift\">redshift</a> of z=4.92.  \nPractically all of the yellow-white objects in the photograph are galaxies in a \n<a href=\"ap970426.html\">nearby cluster</a> which together \n<a href=\"ap970503.html\">act as a lens</a> in \namplifying the light from the ancient galaxy.  \nA follow-up picture by the ground-based \n<a href=\"ap960715.html\">Keck Telescope</a> actually measured the \ndistant redshift.",
