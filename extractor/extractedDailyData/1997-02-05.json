  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Jupiter has rings, too. Unlike <a href=\"ap960717.html\">Saturn's bright rings</a>\nwhich are composed of chunks of ice, <a href=\"ap950802.html\">Jupiter's rings</a>\nare darker and appear to consist of fine particles of rock.  The\n<a href=\"http://irtf.ifa.hawaii.edu/GalleryOfImages/JupRingsMoons.html\">six pictures above</a>\nwere taken in infrared light from the <a href=\"http://irtf.ifa.hawaii.edu/About.html\">Infrared Telescope Facility</a>\nin <a href=\"ap951216.html\">Hawaii</a> in 1994, and cover a time\nspan of two hours.  Quite visible are Jupiter's <a href=\"http://ringside.arc.nasa.gov/\">rings</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960803.html\">bands</a> and <a href=\"ap960827.html\">spots</a>\nin the <a href=\"ap970109.html\">outer atmosphere</a>.  Also visible\nin the photos, however, are two small Jovian moons. <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/amalthea.html#metisx\">Metis</a>,\nonly 40 kilometers across, appears in the second picture as a\ndim spot on the rings to the right of Jupiter.  <a href=\"ap951103.html\">Amalthea</a>,\nmuch larger and brighter, appears in the third frame on the far left, and can\nbe seen to pass across the face of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>\nin frames four and five. The origin of <a href=\"http://ringside.arc.nasa.gov/www/jupiter/jupiter.html\">Jupiter's rings</a>\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1982AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E87%2E1423D\">remains unknown</a>,\nalthough hypothesized to be created by material scattered from\nmeteorite impacts onto <a href=\"ap970117.html\">Jupiter's moons</a>.\n<br>",
