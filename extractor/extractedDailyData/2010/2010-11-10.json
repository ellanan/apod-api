  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid you know that our Milky Way Galaxy has huge bubbles emitting gamma rays from the direction of the galactic center?\n\nNeither did anybody.  \n\nAs the data from the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope\">Fermi satellite</a> began \n<a href=\"ap080828.html\">accumulating</a> over \n<a href=\"ap090321.html\">the past</a> two \n<a href=\"ap100318.html\">years</a>, however, \na large and unusual feature toward \n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">our Galaxy</a>'s center became increasingly evident.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/498884main_DF3_Fermi_bubble_art_labels.jpg\">two bubbles</a> are visible together as the red and white spotted oval surrounding the center of the above all sky image, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/new-structure.html\">released yesterday</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap090926.html\">plane</a> of our Galaxy runs horizontally across the image center.   \n\nAssuming <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html?media_id=27416141\">the bubbles</a> emanate from our Galaxy's center, the scale of the bubbles is huge, rivaling the entire Galaxy in size, and spanning about 50,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> from top to bottom.\n\nEarlier indications of the bubbles have been found on \nexisting all sky maps in the \n<a href=\"ap050205.html\">radio</a>, \n<a href=\"ap030217.html\">microwave</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap990503.html\">X-ray</a>.\n\nThe cause of the bubbles is \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5480\">presently unknown</a>, but will likely be researched for years to come.",
