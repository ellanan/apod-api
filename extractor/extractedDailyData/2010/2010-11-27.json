  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSome 40 million light-years distant,\n<a href=\"ap100304.html\">edge-on</a> spiral galaxy NGC 4216\nis nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our\nown <a href=\"ap080606.html\">Milky Way</a>.\n\nFound in the dense\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/\nvir.html\">Virgo Galaxy Cluster</a>, NGC 4216 is centered in\n<a href=\"http://www.imagingdeepsky.com/Galaxies/NGC4216/\nNGC4216.htm\">this deep telescopic portrait</a>\nflanked by fellow\nVirgo cluster members NGC 4206 (right) and NGC 4222.\n\nLike other large spirals, including the Milky Way, NGC 4216 has\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\ngalaxy_cannibalism.html\">grown by cannibalizing</a>\nsmaller satellite galaxies.\n\nIn fact, this view has caught it in the act, with still distinct satellite\ngalaxies showing faint\n<a href=\"ap080619.html\">star streams extending</a>\nfor thousands of light-years into the halo of NGC 4216.\n\nTaken as part of a survey\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\nstellar_stream_survey_science_highlights.html\">hunting for star\nstreams</a> in nearby spirals,\nthe image was recorded with a small telescope and camera able to\nconvincingly detect faint, extended features.\n\nHaving trouble spotting the star streams?\n\nSlide your cursor over the image to see a composite\n<a href=\"ap070728.html\">negative</a> view.\n\nThe streams should more easily stand out as dark swaths\nagainst a white background.",
