  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes the sky itself seems to glow.  \n\nUsually, this means you are seeing a <a href=\"ap090711.html\">cloud</a> reflecting sunlight or moonlight.  \n\nIf the glow appears as a faint band of light running across the\n<a href=\"ap980523.html\">whole sky</a>,\nyou are probably seeing the combined light\nfrom the billions of stars that compose our\n<a href=\"ap971229.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.  \n\nSuch a glow is visible rising diagonally up to the right in the \n<a href=\"image/1012/skylights_tezel_annotated_big.jpg\">above image</a>.\n\nIf the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL1OCcorbJc\">glow</a> is seen coming up from the horizon just before sunrise or just after sunset,\nhowever, you might be seeing something called\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light\">zodiacal light</a>.  \n\nPictured rising diagonally up to the left in the above image,\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/look-for-the-zodiacal-light-or-false-dawn\">zodiacal light</a> is just sunlight reflected by\n<a href=\"ap981121.html\">tiny dust particles</a> orbiting in our\n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nMany of these particles were <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/researchers-solve-the-mystery-of.html\">ejected by comets</a>.\n\nThe above image was taken just after sunset earlier this month from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%27s_Lanuf\">Ras Lanuf</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya\">Libya</a>.",
