  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDelicate in appearance, these filaments of shocked, glowing gas,\ndraped in planet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus,\nmake up <a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/spider/Misc/veil.html\">the\nVeil Nebula</a>.\n\nThe nebula is a large\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nsupernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a>, an expanding\ncloud born of the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nLight from the original supernova explosion likely reached\nEarth over 5,000 years ago.\n\nAlso known as the Cygnus Loop, the\n<a href=\"http://archive.stsci.edu/fuse/scisumm/\nsci_cyglpstar.html\">Veil Nebula</a> now spans\nnearly 3 degrees or about 6 times the diameter of\nthe full Moon.\n\nThat translates to over 70 light-years\nat its estimated distance of 1,500 light-years.\n\nIn fact, the Veil is so large its brighter parts are\nrecognized as separate nebulae, including The\n<a href=\"ap070101.html\">Witch's Broom</a>\n(NGC 6960) at the bottom of\n<a href=\"http://www.martinpughastrophotography.id.au/Nebulae/\nVeil_Nebula_FLI.htm\">this stunning skyview</a> and\n<a href=\"ap080701.html\">Pickering's Triangle</a> (NGC 6979)\nbelow and right of center.\n\nAt the top is the <a href=\"ap081101.html\">haunting IC 1340</a>.",
