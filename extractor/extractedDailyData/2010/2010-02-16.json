  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's that approaching?\n\nAstronauts on board the\n<a href=\"http://iss.cet.edu/\">International Space Station</a>\nfirst saw it far in the distance.  \n\nSoon it enlarged to become a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette\">dark silhouette</a>.\n\nAs it came even closer, the\n<a href=\"ap060921.html\">silhouette</a> appeared to be a spaceship.\n\nFinally, at just past 11 pm\n(<a href=\"http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/central-time/\">CST</a>) last Tuesday, the object, revealed to be the\n<a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/endeavour.html\">Space Shuttle Endeavour</a>, docked as expected with the\nEarth-orbiting space station.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-130/html/iss022e062672.html\">Pictured above</a>, Endeavour was imaged near Earth's horizon as it approached, where several layers of the\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> were visible.\n\nDirectly behind the shuttle is the\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/mesosphere.html\">mesosphere</a>, which appears blue.  \n\nThe atmospheric layer that appears white is the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere\">stratosphere</a>,\nwhile the orange layer is Earth's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere\">Troposphere</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=789JQPh3-o8\">shuttle mission</a>, which began with a\n<a href=\"ap100209.html\">dramatic night launch</a>\nand will continue into next week, has many <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts130/index.html\">tasks planned</a>.\n\nThese tasks include the delivery of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/stationpayloads/tranquility.html\">Tranquility Module</a> which includes a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS)\">cupola bay window complex</a> that may allow even better views of spaceships approaching and leaving the space station.",
