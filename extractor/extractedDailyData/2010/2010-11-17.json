  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes, you can put some night sky in your art.  \n\nCaptured above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a> earlier this month, a picturesque night sky was photographed behind a picturesque frosted leaf.  \n\nThe reflecting ice crystals on the leaf coolly mimic the shining stars far in the background.  \n\nThe particular background sky on \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/43894176@N07/5150022192/\">this 48-second wide angle exposure</a>, \nhowever, might appear quite interesting and familiar.  \n\nOn the far left, although hard to find, appears a \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide\">streaking meteor</a>.\n\nBelow and to the right of the meteor appears a longer and brighter streak of an airplane.  \n\nThe bright star on the left is the dog-star \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius\">Sirius</a>, the brightest star on the night sky.\n\nTo Sirius' right appears the \n<a href=\"http://160.114.99.91/astrojan/orion.htm\">constellation of Orion</a>, including the three linear belt stars below the red giant \n<a href=\"ap100106.html\">Betelgeuse</a>.  \n\nThe bright patch of light further to the right is the \n<a href=\"ap091014.html\">Pleiades</a> \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open star cluster</a>. \n\nSimilar views including the constellation \n<a href=\"ap101023.html\">Orion</a> can be seen above much of the northern hemisphere for the next several months, \nalthough you might have to provide your own leaf.",
