  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nUnusual jets have been discovered emanating from Comet Hartley 2.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/factsheet.shtml\">EPOXI spacecraft</a> imaged the jets in unprecedented detail during its \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS40HsFcLeA\">flyby</a> \nof the comet earlier this month.  \n\n<a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/3gallery/20101104_Sunshine4.shtml\">Pictured above</a>, sun-illuminated jets shoot away from the two-kilometer long decaying iceberg that orbits the Sun between Earth and Jupiter. \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hartley_2\">Comet Hartley 2</a> \nbecame active recently as it neared the Sun and sunlight warmed the comet.\n\n<a href=\"http://epoxi.umd.edu/7press/news/20101118.shtml\">Preliminary analyses</a> of images like that shown above indicate that the smooth regions around the middle are porous and \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy6Vmw_PTik\">leak</a> frozen water vapor directly out into space.  \n\nUnexpectedly, however, the rough regions at either end appear to shoot \n<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/co2.html\">carbon dioxide</a> jets that expel fluffy \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRwO0j5_sRo\">snowballs</a>, some as large as basketballs, from the nucleus.  \n\nMany of the dots in the above image are thought to be snowballs.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002781/\">unusual jets</a> will continue to be studied, and may yield further clues as to how <a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18013\">comets</a> and \n<a href=\"ap100726.htm\">asteroids</a> \nformed and evolved during the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\">early years</a> of our Solar System.\n\nComet Hartley 2 is slowly evaporating and may completely \n<a href=\"ap000808.html\">break up</a> over the next 1,000 years.",
