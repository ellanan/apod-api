  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening above the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotopaxi\">Cotopaxi volcano</a> in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador\">Ecuador</a>?\n\nQuite a bit, from the looks of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosurf.com/sguisard/Pagim/Cotopaxi.html\">above one-night, time-lapse movie</a>, taken earlier this month.\n\nThe majestic volcano is first seen through breaks in fast moving clouds as the movie begins.\n\nSoon the clouds have dissipated and a sky filled with stars seems to rotate about the snow-peaked volcano's peak.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap070930.html\">band</a> of\n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">our Milky Way Galaxy</a>, the dark\n<a href=\"ap000618.html\">Coal Sack nebula</a>, and the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pqAi6LsITU\">Southern Cross</a>\ncan all be seen overhead.\n\n<a href=\"ap070825.html\">Satellites streak</a> by from several directions.\n\nSoon thin clouds roll by and seem to make the brightest stars sparkle.\n\nOn the volcano (starting at about 1:13 of the movie), the lights of climbers flash.\n\nNear the end of the movie, a\n<a href=\"ap080429.html\">bright airplane passes</a> over the peak with a\n<a href=\"ap060822.html\">residual trail</a> seen drifting away.",
