  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe 16th century Portuguese navigator\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan\">Ferdinand\nMagellan</a> and his crew had plenty of time to study the \nsouthern sky during the\n<a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1519magellan.html\">first\ncircumnavigation</a> of planet Earth.\n\nAs a result, two fuzzy cloud-like\nobjects easily visible to southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the\n<a href=\"ap060809.html\">Clouds of Magellan</a>,\nnow understood to be\nsatellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy.\n\nAbout 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dor/\">Dorado</a>,\nthe <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/lmc.html\">Large\nMagellanic Cloud</a> (LMC) is seen here in a remarkably\ndeep, colorful composite image, starlight from the\n<a href=\"ap080409.html\">central</a> bluish bar\ncontrasting with the telltale reddish glow of\n<a href=\"ap060518.html\">ionized atomic hydrogen gas</a>.\n\nSpanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is\nthe most massive of the Milky Way's\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html\">satellite\ngalaxies</a> and is the home of the \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/\">closest\nsupernova</a> in modern times, SN 1987A. \n\nThe prominent patch at top left is 30 Doradus,\nalso known as the magnificent\n<a href=\"ap090916.html\">Tarantula Nebula</a>.\n\nThe giant star-forming region is about 1,000 light-years across.",
