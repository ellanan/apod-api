  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhile cruising around Saturn,\nbe on the lookout for picturesque juxtapositions of moons and rings.\n\n<a href=\"ap090505.html\">Another striking alignment</a> occurred last March in the view of humanity's\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tkQ4ANklBU\">Saturn-orbiting Cassini</a> spacecraft.\n\n<a href=\"ap080513.html\">Rhea</a>, one of Saturn's larger moons,\nwas caught passing\n<a href=\"ap080211.html\">Epimetheus</a>, one of Saturn's smaller moons.\n\nEpimetheus, as\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12638\">pictured above</a>, is actually well behind the heavily cratered Rhea.\n\nFurther back, several of the\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html\">complex rings of Saturn</a> can be seen crossing the image horizontally.\n\nBehind both the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_moons\">moons</a> and rings is giant Saturn itself,\nshowing expansive but featureless clouds in the\ngreen light where the above image was taken.\n\nThe Cassini mission around Saturn has now\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20100203/\">been extended</a> to\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017\">2017</a>\nto better study the complex planetary system as its season changes from\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXkxfJtz1NY\">equinox</a> to\n<a href=\"ap080922.html\">solstice</a>.",
