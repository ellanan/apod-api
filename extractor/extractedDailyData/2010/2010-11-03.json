  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe small constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sge/index.html\">Sagitta</a>\nsports this large piece of cosmic\njewelry, dubbed the Necklace Nebula.\n\nThe newly\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1043\">discovered</a>\nexample of a <a href=\"ap080918.html\">ring-shaped</a> planetary nebula is\nabout 15,000 light-years distant.\n\nIts bright ring with pearls of glowing gas is half\na light-year across.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">Planetary nebulae</a>\nare created by sun-like stars in a\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/balick/WFPC2/\">final\nphase</a> of stellar evolution.\n\nBut the Necklace Nebula's central star, near the center of a ring\nstrongly tilted to our line of sight, has also been shown to be\n<a href=\"http://astro.unl.edu/naap/ebs/animations/ebs.html\">binary</a>,\na close system of two stars with an orbital period\nof just over a day.\n\nAstronomers estimating the apparent\n<a href=\"ap101021.html\">age</a> of the ring to be\naround 5,000 years, also find more distant gas clouds\nperpendicular to the ring plane, seen here at the upper left and\nlower right.\n\nThose clouds were likely ejected about 5,000 years before the\nclouds forming the necklace.\n\nThis false color image combines emission from\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/\nionization.html\">ionized</a> hydrogen in\nblue, oxygen in green, and nitrogen in red.",
