  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe ancient text has no known title, no known author,\nand is written in no known language:\nwhat does it say and why does it have many astronomy illustrations?  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/voynich.html\">mysterious book</a> was once bought by an\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\">emperor</a>, forgotten on a library shelf,\nsold for thousands of dollars, and later donated to\n<a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/\">Yale</a>.  \n\nPossibly written in the 15th century,\nthe over 200-page volume is known most recently as the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript\">Voynich Manuscript</a>, after its (re-)discoverer in 1912.  \n\nPictured above is an illustration from\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etGlzQtBvXg\">the book</a>\nthat appears to be somehow related to the Sun.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.voynich.com/\">The book</a>\nlabels some patches of the sky with unfamiliar constellations.  \n\nThe inability of modern <a href=\"http://www.historyofastronomy.org/\">historians\nof astronomy</a> to understand the origins of these <a href=\"http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/research/collections/constellations/index.shtml\">constellations</a> is perhaps dwarfed by the inability of\nmodern code-breakers to understand\n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/voynich.html\">the book</a>'s text.  \n\nCan the eclectic brain trust of\n<a href=\"http://www.monroegallery.com/showcase/images/3D_Glasses.jpg\">APOD readers</a> make any progress?\n\nIf you think you can provide any insight, instead of\n<a href=\"mailto:please.do.not@send.us.email.about.this\">sending us email</a> please\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?t=349\">participate</a> in a fresh  \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/discuss_apod.php?date=100131\">online discussion</a>.\n\nThe book itself remains in\n<a href=\"http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/\">Yale's rare book collection</a> under catalog number \"MS 408.\"",
