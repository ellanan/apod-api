  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat do the following things have in common: a cone, the fur of a fox, and a Christmas tree?  \n\nAnswer: they all occur in the constellation of the unicorn\n(<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/mon/index.html\">Monoceros</a>).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.weatherandsky.com/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=7578\">Pictured above</a> as a star forming region\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/\nn2264.html\">cataloged as NGC 2264</a>, the complex jumble of\ncosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light-years distant and\nmixes reddish <a href=\"ap051223.html\">emission nebulae</a>\nexcited by energetic light from\nnewborn stars <a href=\"ap080508.html\">with dark</a>\ninterstellar dust clouds.\n\nWhere the otherwise obscuring dust clouds lie close\nto the hot, young stars they also reflect starlight, forming blue\n<a href=\"ap081031.html\">reflection nebulae</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.weatherandsky.com/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=7578\">wide mosaic</a> spans about 3/4 degree or nearly 1.5 full moons,\ncovering 40 light-years at the distance of NGC 2264.\n\nIts cast of cosmic characters includes\nthe <a href=\"ap080422.html\">Fox Fur Nebula</a>, whose\nconvoluted pelt lies at the upper left, bright\nvariable star S Mon immersed in the blue-tinted haze\njust below the Fox Fur, and the\n<a href=\"ap040529.html\">Cone Nebula</a> at the far right.\n\nOf course, the stars of NGC 2264 are also known as the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Tree_Cluster\">Christmas Tree\nstar cluster</a>.\n\nThe triangular tree shape traced by the stars appears sideways here,\nwith its apex at the Cone Nebula and its broader base\ncentered near <a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/15mon.html\">S Mon</a>.",
