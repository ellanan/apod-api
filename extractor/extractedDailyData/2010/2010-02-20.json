Clarke</a>,\ngeostationary\n<a href=\"http://www.satsig.net/sslist.htm\">orbits are in common use</a>\nfor communication and weather satellites,\na scenario now well-known to astroimagers.\n\nDeep images of the night sky made with telescopes that follow\nthe stars can also\n<a href=\"http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\">pick up geostationary\nsatellites</a> glinting in sunlight still shining\nfar above the Earth's surface.\n\nBecause they all move with the Earth's rotation against the\nbackground of stars, the satellites leave trails that\nseem to follow a highway across the celestial landscape. \n\nFor example, in this wide view of the nearly equatorial\n<a href=\"ap030207.html\">Orion region</a>,\nindividual frames were added to create a 10 minute long exposure.\n\nIt shows <a href=\"ap090210.html\">Orion's belt stars</a> and\n<a href=\"ap070106.html\">well-known nebulae</a> along with many\n2.5 degree long geostationary satellite trails.\n\nThe frames are from an ingenious movie, featuring the\n<a href=\"http://twanight.org/newTWAN/case.asp\">geostationary\nsatellite highway</a>.",
