  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's creating those dark bands on Saturn?  \n\nSometimes it takes a little\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No._1_Ladies%27_Detective_Agency\">sleuthing</a> to figure out the how and why of a\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12734\">picture</a> taken by the Saturn-orbiting\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/spacecraft/index.html\">Cassini</a> spacecraft.  \n\nLet's see.  That large orb on the left must be\n<a href=\"ap090930.html\">Saturn</a> itself.\n\nThose arcs on the right are surely the\n<a href=\"ap071024.html\">rings</a>.  \n\nThe dark band running diagonally must be the shadow of Saturn on the rings.\n\nThat leaves the unusual dark bands superposed on Saturn's disk -- are they the shadows of the rings?  \n\nA <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/punctilious\">punctilious</a> detective would conclude that they are not.\n\nIf one looks carefully, the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UCCHjoQrM\">rings arc</a> from behind the planet on the lower left, around to the right, and therefore must pass on the camera side of the planet on the upper left.\n\nSo the rings themselves cause the dark streaks on Saturn.\n\nThese rings segments appear dark because they are\n<a href=\"ap090111.html\">in the shadow of Saturn</a>.  \n\nThe night part of Saturn shows a faint glow because of sunlight reflected from other parts of the rings.  \n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/06/saturn-brain-bender/\">Got it?</a>  \n\nUnfortunately, if it weren't for the tile floor,\ntomorrow's picture would be even harder to understand.",
