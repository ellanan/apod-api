  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does a volcanic eruption sometimes create lightning?\n\nPictured above, the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakurajima\">Sakurajima volcano</a>\nin southern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>\nwas caught erupting early last month.\n\n<a href=\"ap051002.html\">Magma bubbles</a> so hot they\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescence\">glow</a> shoot away as liquid rock bursts through the\nEarth's surface from below.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.mrietze.com/images/japan09/Jap92115.jpg\">above image</a> is particularly notable, however,\nfor the lightning bolts caught near the volcano's summit.  \n\nWhy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning\">lightning</a>\noccurs even in common thunderstorms remains a topic of research, and the cause of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3aqFCT87_E\">volcanic lightning</a> is even less clear.\n\nSurely,\n<a href=\"ap080705.html\">lightning bolts</a>\nhelp quench areas of opposite but separated electric charges.\n\nOne <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/augustine.html\">hypothesis holds</a> that catapulting magma bubbles or volcanic ash are themselves electrically charged, and by their motion create these separated areas.\n\nOther <a href=\"http://geology.com/articles/volcanic-lightning/\">volcanic lightning</a> episodes may be facilitated by\ncharge-inducing collisions in volcanic dust.\n\n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/lightning.htm\">Lightning</a> is usually occurring somewhere on Earth, typically over 40 times each second.",
