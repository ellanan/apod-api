  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would Mars appear to move backwards?  \n\nMost of the time, the apparent motion of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a> in\n<a href=\"ap010827.html\">Earth's sky</a> is in one direction,\nslow but steady in front of the far distant stars.\n\nAbout every two years, however, the\n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">Earth passes Mars</a>\nas they orbit around the Sun.  \n\nDuring the most recent such pass late last year and early this year,\n<a href=\"ap030828.html\">Mars</a> as usual, loomed\n<a href=\"ap030827.html\">large and bright</a>.  \n\nAlso during this time, Mars appeared to move backwards in the sky,\na phenomenon called\n<a href=\"http://alpha.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/retrograd.html\">retrograde motion</a>.  \n\nPictured above is a series of images digitally stacked\nso that all of the stars images coincide.  \n\nHere, Mars appears to\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72FrZz_zJFU\">trace out a loop</a> in the sky.  \n\nAt the center of the loop, Earth passed Mars and the\n<a href=\"ap080511.html\">retrograde motion</a> was the highest.  \n\n<a href=\"ap060422.html\">Retrograde motion</a> can also be seen for other\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> planets.",
