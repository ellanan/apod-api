  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy did the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruption_of_Eyjafjallaj�kull\">recent volcanic eruption</a> in Iceland create so much ash?\n\nAlthough the large\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash\">ash</a> plume was not unparalleled in its abundance, its location was particularly\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1ztg0wUqKY\">noticeable</a> because it\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eyjafjallaj�kull_volcanic_ash_17_April_2010.png\">drifted across</a> such well populated areas.\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj�kull\">Eyjafjallaj�kull</a>\nvolcano in southern Iceland began erupting on March 20,\nwith a second <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lINmtRiWQ7Q\">eruption</a> starting under the center of a small glacier on April 14.\n\nNeither eruption was <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/environment/gallery/2009-03/top-10-volcanic-eruptions\">unusually powerful</a>.  \n\nThe second eruption, however, melted a large amount of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier\">glacial ice</a> which then cooled and fragmented <a href=\"ap070918.html\">lava</a> into gritty\nglass particles that were carried up with the\n<a href=\"ap060607.html\">rising volcanic</a> plume.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.swisseduc.ch/stromboli/perm/iceland/eyafallajokull_20100416-en.html?id=3\">Pictured above</a> two days ago, \n<a href=\"ap100210.html\">lightning bolts</a> illuminate ash pouring out of the Eyjafjallaj�kull volcano.",
