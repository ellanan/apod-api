  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nEvery 27 years\n<a href=\"http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/eps_aur.shtml\">Epsilon\nAurigae</a> fades, remaining dim\nfor roughly two years before growing bright again.\n\nSince the 19th century, astronomers have studied the mystery star,\neventually arguing that Epsilon Aur, centered in this\n<a href=\"http://www.alsonwongastro.com/epsilon.htm\">telescopic skyview</a>,\nwas actually undergoing a long eclipse by a dark companion object.\n\nBut the nature of the companion and even the state of\nbright star itself could not be pinned down by observations.\n\nContinuing to collect evidence,\n<a href=\"http://www.citizensky.org/content/about-citizen-sky\">Citizen\nSky</a>, a team of professional and amateur astronomers, is studying the\ncurrent eclipse of Epsilon Aur, reporting that it began in August\n2009 and by late December had reached its deepest point.\n\nEpsilon Aur is now expected to remain dim for all of 2010,\nbefore rapidly regaining normal brightness in 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, recent\n<a href=\"http://spitzer.caltech.edu/images/\n2866-ssc2010-01a-Epsilon-Aurigae-Puzzle-Pieces-Snap-Into-Place\">infrared\ndata</a> from the\n<a href=\"http://spitzer.caltech.edu/news/\n1036-ssc2010-01-Centuries-Old-Star-Mystery-Coming-to-a-Close\">Spitzer\nSpace Telescope supports</a>\na model for the enigmatic system that identifies\nEpsilon Aur as a large but lower mass star near the end of its life,\nperiodically eclipsed by a single star embedded in\n<a href=\"ap041210.html\">a dusty disk</a>.\n\nThe disk is estimated to have a radius of about 4\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/au.html\">AU</a>, or 4 times\nthe Earth-Sun distance, and to be about 0.5 AU thick.",
