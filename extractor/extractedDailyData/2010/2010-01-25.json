  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSpanning the sky toward the majestic Clouds of Magellan is an unusual stream of gas: the Magellanic Stream.\n\nThe origin of this gas remains unknown but likely holds a clue to the origin and fate of our\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way\">Milky Way</a>'s\nmost famous satellite galaxies: the\n<a href=\"ap081219.html\">LMC</a> and the\n<a href=\"ap071001.html\">SMC</a>.\n\nUntil recently, two leading genesis hypotheses have been considered: that\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009NewA...14..692H\">the stream</a>\nwas created by gas stripped off these galaxies as they passed through the\n<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/space/080816-milky-way-map.html\">halo</a> of our\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjRJeaNtxN4\">Milky Way</a>, or that the stream was created by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force\">differential gravitational tug</a>\nof the Milky Way.\n\nRecently, however, wide angle radio images -- including those from the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope\">Byrd Green Bank Telescope</a> -- have shown that the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Stream\">Magellanic Stream</a>\nis longer and older than previously thought, perhaps as old as 2.5 billion years.  \n\nThese observations bolster a third possible origin for\n<a href=\"ap980826.html\">the stream</a> -- that the\n<a href=\"ap070330.html\">Large and Small Magellanic Cloud</a>\ngalaxies once passed so close to each other that\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force\">gravitational tides</a>\ntriggered a burst of star formation that left the stream.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2010/magstream/\">Pictured above</a> digitally superposed on a recently-completed all-sky image in visible light, the\n<a href=\"http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves\">radio emission</a> of Magellanic stream is shown in false color pink extending across the sky and ending at the\n<a href=\"ap060806.html\">two Magellanic galaxies</a> on the lower right.",
