  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nImagine a pipe as wide as a state and as long as the Earth.  \n\nNow imagine that this pipe is filled with\n<a href=\"ap970904.html\">hot gas moving</a> 50,000 kilometers per hour.  \n\nFurther imagine that this pipe is not made of metal but a transparent\n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/Magnetic/\">magnetic field</a>.  \n\nYou are envisioning just one of thousands of young\nspicules on the <a href=\"ap090405.html\">active Sun</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.arcetri.astro.it/science/solar/IBIS/gallery/IBIS/Photos.html\">Pictured above</a> is one of the highest\nresolution image yet of these enigmatic solar flux tubes.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/star_quakes_40728.html\">Spicules</a> line the above frame of\nsolar active \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyaqxKkSCpU\">region 11092</a> \nthat crossed the \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18012\">Sun</a> last month, but are particularly evident converging on the \n<a href=\"ap051106.html\">sunspot</a> on the lower left.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1WsC1TR-x8\">Time-sequenced images</a> have recently shown that\n<a href=\"ap081102.html\">spicules</a> last about five minutes,\nstarting out as\n<a href=\"ap050216.html\">tall tubes</a>\nof rapidly rising gas but eventually\nfading as the gas peaks and falls back down to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Sun</a>.  \n\nWhat determines the creation and dynamics of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...708.1579C\">spicules</a> remains a topic of active research.",
