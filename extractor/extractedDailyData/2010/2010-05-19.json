  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLong before \n<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/Stonehenge\">Stonehenge</a> was built, well before the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls\">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> \nwere written, ancient artists painted life-sized figures on canyon walls in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a> -- but why?\n\nNobody is sure.\n\nThe entire panel of figures, \nwhich dates back about 7,000 years, is called the \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/upload/HorseshoeBook.pdf\">Great Gallery</a> and was found on the walls of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Canyon_(Utah)\">Horseshoe</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpDeGsOUYZY\">Canyon</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm\">Canyonlands National</a> \n<a href=\"ap080929.html\">Park</a>.\n\nThe humans who painted them likely hunted\n<a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_7GByx-4hs\">Mammoths</a>.\n\nThe unusual fuzziness of largest figure led to \n<a href=\"http://indra.com/~dheyser/bc/bc_j.html\">this mural section</a>'s informal designation as the \n<a href=\"http://talkingtree.org/index.php?showimage=625\">Holy Ghost Panel</a>, although the intended attribution and societal importance of the figure are really unknown.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.photoshelter.com/c/bretwebsterimages/gallery-img-show/Galactic-Desert/G00003veX5HFA71E/\">above image</a> was taken during a clear night in March.\n\nThe oldest objects in the above image are not the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictographs\">pictographs</a>, however, but the stars of our \n<a href=\"ap090827.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> far in the background, some of which are billions of years old.",
