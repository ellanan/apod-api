  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over the South Pole of Venus?  \n\nTo find out, scientists have been studying images taken by the\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEMBD3808BE_0.html\">robotic Venus Express spacecraft</a> when it passes over the\nlower spin axis of Earth's overheated twin.\n\nSurprisingly, recent images from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Express\">Venus Express</a>\ndo not confirm <a href=\"ap070501.html\">previous sightings</a> of a double storm system there, but rather found a single unusual swirling cloud vortex.\n\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.europlanet-eu.org/outreach/images/stories/ep/news/epsc2010/piccioniimage2.jpg\">above recently released image</a> sequence taken in infrared light and digitally compressed, darker areas correspond to higher temperatures and hence lower regions of Venus' atmosphere.  \n\nAlso illuminating are\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrMEsQkmRQI\">recently</a> released\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwmkINj1wAQ\">movies</a>, which show similarities between\n<a href=\"ap070501.html\">Venus' southern vortex</a>\nand the vortex that swirls over the\n<a href=\"ap061113.html\">South Pole of Saturn</a>.\n\nUnderstanding the <a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002679/\">peculiar dynamics</a> of why, at times, two eddies appear, while at other times a single peculiar eddy appears, may give insight into how\n<a href=\"ap050829.html\">hurricanes</a> evolve on Earth, and remain a topic of research for some time.  \n\nIn three months, the European\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/\">Venus Express</a> spacecraft will be joined around Venus by the Japanese\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_(Planet-C)\">Akatsuki</a> satellite.",
