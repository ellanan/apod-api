  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDo nearly exact copies of you exist in other universes?  \n\nIf one or more of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse\">multiverse hypotheses</a> is correct, then quite possibly they do.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/every.jpg\">above computer-enhanced illustration</a>, independent universes are shown as independent \n<a href=\"ap050130.html\">circles or spheres</a>.  \n\nSpheres may be causally disconnected from all other spheres, \nmeaning no communications can pass between them.  \n\nSome spheres may contain different realizations of our universe, \nwhile others may have different \n<a href=\" http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewforum.php?f=39\">physical laws</a>.  \n\nAn entire set of \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104033\">parallel universes</a> \nis called a \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21958\">multiverse</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/eye1.htm\">human eye</a> \nmight represent the possibility that realizations of some \n<a href=\"http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html\">multiverse \nhypotheses</a> might only exist in the \n<a href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_127.html\">human mind</a>.\n\nOne criticism of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\">multiverse hypotheses</a> \nis that they are frequently difficult to test.  \n\nSome <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006JCAP...01..017G\">multiverse hypotheses</a> may therefore be great fun to think about but not practically \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\">falsifiable</a> \nand therefore have no predictive scientific value.",
