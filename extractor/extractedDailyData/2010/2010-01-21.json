  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGalaxies of the NGC 7771 Group are featured in\n<a href=\"http://www.imagingdeepsky.com/Galaxies/NGC7771/\nNGC7770_NGC7771.htm\">this intriguing skyscape</a>.\n\nSome 200 million light-years distant toward the constellation\nPegasus,\n<a href=\"ap090829.html\">NGC 7771 is</a> the large, edge-on\nspiral near center,\nabout 75,000 light-years across, with two smaller galaxies just\nbelow it.\n\nLarge spiral NGC 7769 is seen face-on to the right.\n\nGalaxies of the NGC 7771 group are interacting, making\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/\nbackgrnd.html\">repeated close passages</a> that will ultimately result in\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale.\n\nThe interactions can be traced by galaxy\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\ngalaxy/2002/09/\">distortions</a> and faint\n<a href=\"ap080619.html\">streams of stars</a>\ncreated by gravitational tides.\n\nBut a clear view of the galaxy group is difficult to come by,\nas the deep image also reveals extensive clouds of\n<a href=\"ap070427.html\">foreground dust</a> sweeping across the field.\n\nThe dim, dusty nebulae reflect starlight from our own Milky Way Galaxy\nand lie only a few hundred light-years above the\n<a href=\"ap090613.html\">galactic plane</a>.",
