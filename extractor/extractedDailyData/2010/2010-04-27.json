  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created this strange sound in Earth's Pacific Ocean?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/specs_mystery.html\">Pictured above</a> is a visual representation of a \n<a href=\"http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sounds/bloop.wav\">loud and unusual sound</a>, dubbed a Bloop, captured by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Pacific_Ocean_autonomous_hydrophone_array\">deep sea microphones</a> in 1997.\n\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sounds/bloop.html\">above graph</a>, time is shown on the horizontal axis, deep \n<a href=\"http://www.chameleongroup.org.uk/software/piano.html\">pitch</a> \nis shown on the vertical axis, and brightness designates loudness.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://www.bloopwatch.org/thebloop.html\">Bloops</a> are some of the \n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg\">loudest sounds</a> of any type ever recorded in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean\">Earth's oceans</a>, their origin remains unknown.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/102ns_001.htm\">The Bloop</a> sound was placed as occurring several times off the southern coast of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America\">South America</a> and was \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TzZCL-u46Q\">audible</a> \n5,000 kilometers away.  \n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/06/13/bloop/\">the sound</a> has similarities to those vocalized by living organisms, not even a <a href=\"http://school.discoveryeducation.com/schooladventures/planetocean/bluewhale.html\">blue whale</a> is <a href=\"ap090301.html\">large enough</a> to croon this loud.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.damninteresting.com/the-call-of-the-bloop\">The sounds</a> point to the intriguing hypothesis that even larger life forms lurk in the unexplored darkness of Earth's \n<a href=\"http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceandepth.html\">deep oceans</a>.\n\nA less imagination-inspiring possibility, however, is that the sounds resulted from some sort of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGHlEBvKYw\">iceberg calving</a>.  \n\nNo further <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloop\">Bloops</a> \nhave been heard since 1997, although \n<a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/91202/Strange-sounds-under-the-sea\">other loud</a> and \n<a href=\" http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/specs_mystery.html\">unexplained sounds</a> have been recorded.",
