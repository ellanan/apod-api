  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is there a line segment on the sky?\n\nIn one of the more precise alignments known in the universe, what is pictured above is actually a disk galaxy being seen almost perfectly edge on.\n\nThe image from the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpkrVw_E6Nw\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> is a spectacular visual reminder of just how \n<a href=\"ap100225.html\">thin</a> \n<a href=\"ap060612.html\">disk</a> \n<a href=\"ap970228.html\">galaxies</a> can be.  \n\nNGC 4452, a galaxy in the nearby \n<a href=\"ap080708.html\">Virgo Cluster of Galaxies</a>, \nis so thin that it is actually \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...339..783H\">difficult to determine</a> what type of disk galaxy it is.  \n\nIts lack of a visible dust lane indicates that it is a low-dust \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_galaxy\">lenticular galaxy</a>, although it is still possible that a view from on top would reveal spiral structure.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/11/08/galaxy-on-edge/\">unusual stellar line segment</a> spans about 35,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> from end to end.\n\nNear <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1029a/\">NGC 4452</a>'s center is a slight bulge of stars, while \n<a href=\"ap091209.html\">hundreds of background galaxies</a> \nare visible far in the distance.  \n\nGalaxies that <i>appear</i> this thin are rare mostly because our Earth must reside (nearly) in the extrapolated \n<a href=\"http://www.lon-capa.org/~mmp/applist/si/plane.htm\">planes</a> of their thin galactic disks.  \n\nGalaxies that actually <i>are</i> this thin are relatively common -- for example our own \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> is thought to be about this \n<a href=\"ap100215.html\">thin</a>.",
