  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat drives auroras on Saturn?\n\nTo help find out, scientists have sorted through hundreds of infrared images of \n<a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a> taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEMD6E2VQUD_0.html\">Cassini spacecraft</a> for other purposes, trying to find enough aurora images to correlate changes and make \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzwiTspxtrg\">movies</a>.\n\nOnce made, some movies clearly show that \n<a href=\"ap081119.html\">Saturnian auroras</a> can change not only with the angle of the Sun, but also as the planet rotates.\n\nFurthermore, some <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AmyfuJDMlY\">auroral changes</a> appear related to waves in Saturn's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere\">magnetosphere</a> likely caused by Saturn's moons.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13402\">Pictured above</a>, a false-colored image taken in 2007 shows Saturn in three bands of infrared light.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap070627.html\">rings reflect</a> relatively blue sunlight, while the planet itself glows in comparatively low energy red.  \n\nA band of <a href=\"ap050222.html\">southern aurora</a> in visible in green.\n\nInspection of many more Saturnian images may well lead to an even better understanding of both Saturn's and \n<a href=\"ap100701.html\">Earth's auroras</a>.",
