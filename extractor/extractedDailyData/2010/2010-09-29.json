  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you look closely at the Moon, you will see a large airplane in front of it.  \n\nWell, not always.  OK, hardly ever.  \n\nBut if you wait for days with your camera attached to a \n<a href=\"http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/howtophoto/index.htm\">Moon tracker</a> in a place where \n<a href=\"ap010129.html\">airplanes</a> are known to pass, you might catch a \n<a href=\"ap070605.html\">good photograph</a> of it.  \n\nWell, if you're <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xDehLpmmQw\">lucky</a>.  OK, extremely lucky.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.iceinspace.com.au/iotw.html?iotwid=137\">above image</a> was \n<a href=\"http://www.iceinspace.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=65931\">taken</a> two weeks ago over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Queensland\">South East</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland\">Queensland</a>, \n<a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> using an \n<a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed\">exposure time</a> of 1/250th of a second and, in the words of the photographer, \"a \n<a href=\"http://obviousmag.org/archives/uploads/2008/08041703_blog.uncovering.org_hine.jpeg\">nerve of steel</a>\".",
