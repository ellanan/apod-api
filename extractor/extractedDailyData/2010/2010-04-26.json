  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nInside the head of this interstellar monster is a star that is slowly destroying it.  \n\nThe monster, on the right, is actually an inanimate pillar of \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/1.html\">gas</a> and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> that measures over a \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light year</a> in length.  \n\nThe star, not itself visible through the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFWY_t3B5cE\">opaque dust</a>, \nis bursting out partly by ejecting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_beam_weapon\">energetic beams of particles</a>.\n\nSimilar epic battles are being waged all over the star-forming \n<a href=\"ap070425.html\">Carina Nebula</a>.  \n\nThe stars will win in the end, destroying their \n<a href=\"ap070218.html\">pillars of creation</a> \nover the next 100,000 years, and resulting in a new \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a> of stars.\n\nThe pink dots around the image are newly formed stars that have already been freed from their birth \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq9IKsH9BXg\">monster</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/13/image/a/\">above image</a> was released last week in commemoration of the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>s 20th year of operation.\n\n\nThe technical name for the stellar jets are \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig-Haro_objects\">Herbig-Haro objects</a>.  \n\nHow a star creates \n<a href=\"ap060203.html\">Herbig-Haro jet</a>s is an ongoing \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1167L\">topic of research</a>, but it likely involves an \n<a href=\"ap991219.html\">accretion disk</a> swirling around a central star.\n\nA second impressive \n<a href=\"ap991129.html\">Herbig-Haro jet</a> occurs diagonally near the image center.",
