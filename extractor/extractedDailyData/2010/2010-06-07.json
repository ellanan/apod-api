  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA new comet is brightening and is now expected to become visible to the unaided eye later this month.\n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2009r1.html\">C/2009 R1 (McNaught)</a> is already showing an\n<a href=\"ap091216.html\">impressive tail</a> and is currently visible through\n<a href=\"http://www.birdwatching.com/optics/how_binoculars_work.html\">binoculars</a>.  \n\nThe above image, taken yesterday from the\n<a href=\"http://www.altamiraobs.org.es/\">Altamira Observatory</a> in the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a>\nand spanning about five degrees, shows an impressive\n<a href=\"ap061106.html\">green</a> coma and a\n<a href=\"ap020515.html\">long ion tail</a> in front of distant star trails.\n\nAlthough\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2009R1/2009R1.html\">predicting the brightness</a> of comets is notoriously difficult,\n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2009R1_1.html\">current estimates</a> place\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2009_R1\">Comet McNaught</a> as\n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/icq/CometMags.html#2009R1\">becoming visible</a> to unaided northern hemisphere\n<a href=\"http://cometchasing.skyhound.com/comets/2009_R1.gif\">observers</a> in late June, before sunrise, and in early July, after sunset.\n\nDiscovered by\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._McNaught\">Robert McNaught</a> last year, the sun-orbiting iceberg will pass the Earth next week and will continue to melt and shed debris as it\n<a href=\"http://cometchasing.skyhound.com/\">closes in</a> on the Sun until early July.\n\nAfter reaching about half of the\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/au.html\">Earth-Sun distance</a>\nfrom the Sun, the comet should fade rapidly as it then heads out of the\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/exploring-the-inner-solar-system/\">inner Solar System</a>.",
