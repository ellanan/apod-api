  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSpiral galaxy NGC 4651 is a mere 35 million light-years distant,\ntoward the well-groomed constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices\">Coma Berenices</a>.\n\nAbout 50 thousand light-years across, this galaxy is seen to have\na faint umbrella-shaped structure (right) that\nseems to extend some 50 thousand light-years farther,\nbeyond the bright galactic disk.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_ngc4651.html\">The\ngiant cosmic umbrella</a> is now known to be composed of\n<a href=\"ap080619.html\">tidal star streams</a>.\n\nThe streams themselves are\nextensive trails of stars\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/main.html\">gravitationally\nstripped</a>\nfrom a smaller satellite galaxy that was eventually\ntorn apart.\n\nPlacing your cursor over the image will superimpose a simulation of\nthe satellite galaxy's path as it was disrupted and\nabsorbed into NGC 4651.\n\nRecent work by a remarkable collaboration of amateur and professional\nastronomers to image faint structures around bright galaxies\nsuggests that\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4860\">even in nearby galaxies</a>,\nsuch tidal star streams\nare common.\n\nThe result is\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\ncosmological_modeling_overview.html\">predicted by models</a>\nof galaxy formation,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703601\">including</a>\nthe formation of our Milky Way.",
