  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs that Venus or an airplane? \n\nA common <a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/topten.php\">ponderable</a> for sky enthusiasts is deciding \nif that bright spot near the horizon is the planet Venus. \n\nUsually, an airplane will show itself by \n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">moving significantly</a> in a few moments. \n\nVenus will set only slowly as the Earth turns. \n\nStill, the identification would be easier if Venus did not keep shifting its position each night. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3001233\">Pictured above</a>, Venus was captured on 44 \n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3002807\">different nights</a> during 2006 and 2007 over the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolu\">Bolu</a> mountains in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a>, \nwhen Earth's sister planet appeared exclusively in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_star\">evening sky</a>. \n\nThe average spacing of the images was about five days, while the images were always taken with the \n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18012\">Sun</a> about seven degrees below the horizon. \n\nThat bright spot toward the west in your \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight\">evening sky</a> this month might be neither Venus nor an airplane, but \n<a href=\"http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/\">Mars</a>.",
