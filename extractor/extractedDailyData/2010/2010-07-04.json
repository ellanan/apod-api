  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe first direct image of an extrasolar planet orbiting a star similar to our Sun has been confirmed.\n\nLocated just 500 light-years away toward the constellation\n<a href=\"ap080508.html\">Scorpius</a>,\nthe parent star, cataloged as 1RXS J160929.1-210524,\nis only slightly less massive and a little cooler than\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">the Sun</a>.\n\nThe star is, however, much younger, a few\n<a href=\"http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/six.asp\">million</a> years old\ncompared to the middle-aged Sun's 5\n<a href=\"http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp\">billion</a> years.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/sunstarplanet\">This sharp infrared\nimage</a> shows the young star's planetary companion\npositioned above and left of center.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18000\">planet</a> is estimated to have a mass about 8 times\nthe mass of Jupiter, and orbit a whopping 330 times the Earth-Sun\n<a href=\"ap981212.html\">distance</a> from its parent star.\n\nThe young planetary companion is still hot and relatively\nbright in\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\ncosmic_reference/whatisir.html\">infrared</a> light, likely due to\nthe heat generated during its\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_formation#Giant_planets\">formation</a> by gravitational contraction.\n\nIn fact, such newborn <a href=\"ap080521.html\">planets</a>\nare easier to detect before they age and cool and become much more faint.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...689L.153L\">discovery</a> image, <a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/sunstarplanet\">shown above</a>, was taken in 2008 but\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/11486\">confirmed only recently</a>\nby <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1006.3070L\">noting</a> that the planet stayed with its parent star as background stars slightly shifted over time.",
