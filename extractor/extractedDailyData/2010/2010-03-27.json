  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nStark shadows of\n<a href=\"ap001228.html\">mountains</a> and\n<a href=\"ap090311.html\">crater walls</a> stand out along\nthe lunar terminator, or shadow line between night and day,\nin this\n<a href=\"ap070209.html\">telescopic</a> image.\n\nOf course, if viewed from the\n<a href=\"ap040102.html\">lunar surface</a> near the terminator line,\nthe Sun would be rising and still close to the lunar horizon.\n\nBut the picture's inset at the left highlights a more elusive\nlunar sunrise phenomenon.\n\nStreaming through a gap in the eastern wall of 45 kilometer wide\n<a href=\"http://the-moon.wikispaces.com/Hesiodus\">Hesiodus crater</a>,\nthe low-angle sunlight produces\n<a href=\"http://www.sjaa.net/eph/0801/h.html\">a long sunrise ray</a>\nplaying along the otherwise shadowed crater floor.\n\nSunrise rays are short-lived and can be rewarding to spot for\n<a href=\"http://www.shallowsky.com/moon/rukl54.html\">Moon\nenthusiasts</a> with telescopes.\n\nSeen in Hesiodus and other craters, the ray timing can be\ncalculated based on the\n<a href=\"http://www.lunar-occultations.com/rlo/rays/rays.htm\">observer's\nlocation</a>.\n\nThis picture of a first quarter Moon was\nrecorded at 23:45 UT on February 22nd from Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nIn the inset, the larger crater Pitatus is at the right.\n\nFor location, Hesiodus and Pitatus are circled at the bottom of the picture.",
