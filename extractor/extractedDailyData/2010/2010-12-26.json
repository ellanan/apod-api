  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=173537\">Orion always comes up sideways</a> ... and was caught in the\nact earlier this month by over a snowy landscape in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donegal\">Donegal</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland\">Ireland</a>.\n\nTo compose this serene picture, the photographer found a \n<a href=\"ap101117.html\">picturesque setting</a> to the east, waited until after sunset, and then momentarily lit the foreground with a flashlight.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap061229.html\">three bright stars</a> in \n<a href=\"ap101023.html\">Orion</a>'s belt stand in a \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7rMwLxi3Xs\">nearly vertical line</a> above the snow covered road at the bottom.\n\nHanging from his belt, the stars and\n<a href=\"ap021220.html\">nebulae</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/constellations/swordoforion.html\">Hunter's sword</a> are visible lower and to the right.\n\nYellow-orange <a href=\"ap100106.html\">Betelgeuse</a> is the brightest star on the image left.\n\nAs winter progresses in Earth's northern hemisphere, \n<a href=\" http://youaskandy.com/questions-answers/25-article-series-1950/16922-why-can-we-see-orion-only-in-winter.html\">Orion</a> \nwill rise earlier and so appear continually higher in the sky at sunset.",
