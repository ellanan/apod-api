  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDiscovered in mid-2005,\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0601018\">Pluto's\nsmall moons</a> were\n<a href=\"ap051103.html\">provisionally</a> designated\nS/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2.\n\nThey have now been officially\n<a href=\"http://www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/pressreleases/2006/\n060622.asp\">christened Nix and Hydra</a>.\n\nCompared to Pluto and its\nlarge moon Charon, at 2,360 and 1,210 kilometers in diameter\nrespectively, Nix (inner moon) and Hydra (outer moon) are tiny,\nestimated to be only 40 to 160 kilometers across.\n\nPluto and Charon are bright enough to create\n<a href=\"ap010415.html\">diffraction</a> spikes\nin this Hubble Space Telescope image, but\n<a href=\"http://www.boulder.swri.edu/plutomoons/\">Nix and Hydra are</a>\nsome 5,000 times fainter than Pluto and\nappear only as small points of light.\n\nStill, their new names are appropriate for the distant\nPluto system.\n\nIn mythology,\n<a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/n/nyx.html\">Nix was</a>\nthe goddess of darkness and night and\nthe mother of Charon,\n<a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/h/hydra.html\">while Hydra</a>\nwas a nine headed monster\nand is now orbiting the solar system's ninth planet.\n\nOf course Nix and Hydra also share initials with\nthe pluto-bound spacecraft\n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/\">New Horizons</a>.",
