  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy does this star have so few heavy elements?\n\nStars born in the\n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/P/PopI.html\">generation of our Sun</a> have an expected abundance of  elements heavier than\n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> and\n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/2.shtml\">helium</a> mixed into their atmospheres.\n\nStars born in the generation before our Sun,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_II_stars#Population_II_stars\">Population II stars</a>, the stars that created most of the heavy elements\naround us today, are seen to have some, although fewer, elements heavier\nthan H and He.\n\nFurthermore, even the elusive never-seen first stars in the universe, so-called\n<a href=\"ap030610.html\">Population III</a> stars, are predicted to have a large mass and a small but set amount of heavy elements.  \n\nYet low-mass Milky Way star\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1132/\">SDSS J102915+172927</a>, among others, appears to have fewer metals than\never predicted for any stars, including at least 50 times less lithium\nthan came out of the Big Bang.  \n\nThe unusual nature of\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHKi8R6aqm4\">this star</a>, initially cataloged by the\n<a href=\"ap980617.html\">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> (SDSS) and\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1132b/\">pictured above</a>, was\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1132/eso1132.pdf\">discovered</a> by detailed spectroscopic observations by a large\n<a href=\"ap110601.html\">VLT telescope</a> in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.\n\nMany models of star formation indicate that such a\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso1132a/\">star</a>\nshould not even form.  \n\nResearch is ongoing, however, with one leading hypothesis\n<a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/107125/Star-in-Leo-shouldnt-exist\">holding</a> that fragile primordial\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium\">lithium</a> was destroyed in the star's hot core.",
