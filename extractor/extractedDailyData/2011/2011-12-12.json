  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat could create this unusual vein of rock on Mars?\n\nA leading hypothesis is that\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-377&amp;rn=news.xml&amp;rst=3220\">this thin rock layer</a> dubbed \"Homestake\" was deposited by a running liquid -- like most\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_vein\">mineral veins</a> are here on Earth.\n\nAnd the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRlNOyxWWf8\">running liquid</a> of choice is water.\n\nTherefore, <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/08dec_slamdunk/\">this mineral streak</a> -- rich in calcium and sulfur -- is the latest in the growing body of evidence that part of\n<a href=\"ap050401.html\">Mars had a watery</a> past.\n\nThis, in turn, increases the speculation that\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars\">Mars was once hospitable to life</a>.  \n\nPictured above is a vista taken near the western rim of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_(crater)\">Endeavour Crater</a> by the\n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">Opportunity rover</a> currently exploring Mars.  \n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15033\">inset image</a> shows a close up of the recently discovered mineral vein.",
