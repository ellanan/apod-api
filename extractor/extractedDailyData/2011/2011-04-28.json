  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn June 4, 2010 Regulus, alpha star of the constellation Leo,\nand wandering planet Mars were at about the same apparent brightness,\n<a href=\"ap100610.html\">separated on the sky</a> by 1.5 degrees.\n\nAn ingenious and creative 10 second exposure from\n<a href=\"image/1104/CamerapendularMichelbergerX.jpg\">a swinging camera</a>\nrecorded these gyrating trails of the celestial pairing.\n\nCan you tell which trail belongs to the star and\nwhich to the planet?\n\nHint: atmospheric turbulence causes the image of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophys-assist.com/educate/starry/\nstarrynight.htm\">star to scintillate</a> or\nvary in brightness and color more readily than the planet.\n\nThe scintillation is more pronounced\nbecause the star is effectively a point source of light seen\nas a narrow bundle of light rays.\n\nRapidly changing\n<a href=\"http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/\nu14l4a.cfm\">refraction</a> due to\nturbulence along the\n<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/\narticle.cfm?id=why-do-stars-twinkle\">line of sight affects</a>\ndifferent colors of light by\ndifferent amounts and generally produces a\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1952IrAJ....2....5E\">twinkling\neffect for stars</a>.\n\nBut Mars is much closer than the distant stars and an extended\nsource of light.\n\nThough tiny, its disk is seen as a bundle of\nlight rays that is substantially broader compared to\na star's and so, on average,\nless affected by small scale\n<a href=\"http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/\ntwinkle.htm\">turbulence</a>.\n\nThe result is the varied,\nrainbow like trail for Regulus (left)\nand the steadier, consistently reddish trail for Mars.",
