  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nFor the first time, the entire Sun is being imaged all at once.\n\nThis has become possible because the two\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO\">STEREO satellites</a> orbiting and monitoring the Sun are now on opposite sides of the Sun.\n\nThe two satellites have been\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_1xcXUkg_s\">drifting apart</a>,\nas expected, since their\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjwcssuUb5Y\">launch</a> in 2006, since one satellite orbits slightly closer to the Sun than the other.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/news/entire-sun.html\">above image</a> shows nearly the entire Sun as it appeared one day last week, a few days before maximum exposure.  \n\nYesterday, the dark gap in the center closed completely, and\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/06feb_fullsun/\">STEREO was able</a> to beam back to Earth full 360 degree images of the\n<a href=\"http://www.darkmattermag.com/august03/dark_science.htm\">closest star</a>.  \n\nFull solar images are useful scientifically for a number of reasons, including catching rapidly evolving\n<a href=\"ap031029.html\">flare</a>s,\n<a href=\"ap070206.html\">coronal mass ejection</a>s,\n<a href=\"ap061213.html\">tsunami</a>s, and\n<a href=\"ap080601.html\">filaments</a>, no matter where they occur on the Sun,\nas well as monitoring days-long\n<a href=\"ap031027.html\">sunspots</a> and\n<a href=\"ap040726.html\">active region</a>s without losing them as they rotate out of view.\n\nEven though the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html\">STEREO satellites</a> will continue to drift apart at about 44 degrees per year,\n<a href=\"http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/desert_rose13/Cats%20Galore/cat_with_glasses.jpg\">Sun-staring</a> instruments on or near the Earth will augment them to provide a full\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory\">view of the Sun</a> for the next several years.",
