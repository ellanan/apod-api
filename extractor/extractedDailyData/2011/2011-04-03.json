  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOver 400,000 light years across\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso9924b/\">NGC 6872 is</a> an\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701291\">enormous spiral galaxy</a>,\nat least 4 times the size of our own very large Milky Way.\n\nAbout 200 million light-years distant, toward the southern\nconstellation Pavo, the Peacock, the remarkable\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/\">galaxy's stretched\nout shape</a> is due to its ongoing\ngravitational interaction, likely leading to\nan eventual merger,\nwith the nearby smaller\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/\nngc6872/\">galaxy IC 4970</a>.\n\nIC 4970 is seen just below and right of\nthe giant galaxy's core in\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/node/11625\">this cosmic color portrait</a>\nfrom the 8 meter\n<a href=\"ap030909.html\">Gemini South telescope</a> in Chile.\n\nThe idea to image this titanic galaxy collision comes from a\n<a href=\"http://ausgo.aao.gov.au/contest2010/\">winning contest essay</a>\nsubmitted last year to the\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?q=node/132\">Gemini Observatory</a>\nby the Sydney Girls High School Astronomy Club.\n\nIn addition to inspirational aspects and aesthetics,\nclub members argued\nthat a color image would be more than just a pretty picture.\n\nIn their winning essay they noted that\n\"If enough colour data is obtained in the image it may reveal easily\naccessible information about the different populations of stars, star\nformation, relative rate of star formation due to the interaction, and\nthe extent of dust and gas present in these galaxies\".\n(<i>Editor's note:</i> For Australian schools,\n<a href=\"http://ausgo.aao.gov.au/contest/\">2011 contest information\nis here.</a>)",
