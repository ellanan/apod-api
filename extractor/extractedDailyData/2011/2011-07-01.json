  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn the 1920s, examining photographic plates from the\n<a href=\"http://www.mtwilson.edu/vir/100/\">Mt. Wilson Observatory's</a>\n100 inch telescope,\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/about/history/\nthe_man_behind_the_name/\">Edwin Hubble</a> determined the distance to the\n<a href=\"ap100109.html\">Andromeda Nebula</a>,\ndecisively demonstrating the existence of other galaxies far beyond\nthe Milky Way.\n\nHis notations are evident on the historic plate image\ninset at the lower right, shown in context with ground based\nand Hubble Space Telescope images of the region made\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2011/15/\">nearly 90 years later</a>.\n\nBy comparing different plates, Hubble\nsearched for novae, stars which underwent a\nsudden increase in brightness.\n\nHe found several on this plate, indicating their position with\nlines and an \"N\".  \n\nLater, discovering that the one near the upper right corner\nwas actually a type of\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2011/15/\nfastfacts/\">variable star known</a> as\n<a href=\"ap080212.html\">a cepheid</a>,\nhe crossed out the \"N\" and wrote \"VAR!\".\n\nThanks to the work of Harvard\nastronomer <a href=\"ap000903.html\">Henrietta Leavitt</a>, cepheids,\nregularly varying pulsating stars, could be used as standard candle\n<a href=\"http://www.aavso.org/cosmic-distance-ladder\">distance indicators</a>.\n\nIdentifying such a star allowed Hubble to show\nthat Andromeda was not a small cluster of stars and gas within our own\ngalaxy, but a large galaxy in its own right at a substantial\ndistance from the Milky Way.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2011/15/caption.html\">Hubble's\ndiscovery</a> is responsible for establishing our modern concept of a\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-iarticle_query?1995PASP..107.1133T\">Universe filled with galaxies</a>.",
