  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way, the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) is an <a href=\"ap081219.html\">alluring sight</a>\nin dark southern skies and the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dor/\">Dorado</a>.\n\nA mere 180,000 light-years distant,\nthe LMC is seen in amazing detail in this\n<a href=\"http://astrosurf.com/lorenzi/ccd/LMC_HaOIIILRGB.htm\">very\ndeep 4 frame mosaic</a> of telescopic images,\na view that reveals the\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html\">Milky Way's\nsatellite</a> to have the appearance\nof a fledgling <a href=\"ap100820.html\">barred spiral galaxy</a>.\n\nThe mosaic includes image data taken through a narrow filter\nthat transmits only the red light of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/\nionization.html\">Ionized</a>\nby energetic starlight, a hydrogen atom emits the\ncharacteristic red\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">H-alpha</a> light\nas its single electron is\nrecaptured and transitions to lower energy states.\n\nAs a result, this mosaic seems spattered with\npinkish clouds of hydrogen gas surrounding massive, young stars.\n\nSculpted by the strong stellar winds and ultraviolet radiation,\nthe glowing <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/milkyway/\nism.html\">hydrogen clouds</a> are known as\n<a href=\"http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses//\nastro201/stromgren_sphere.htm\">H II</a>\n(ionized hydrogen) regions.\n\nComposed of many overlapping clouds,\nthe sprawling <a href=\"ap110111.html\">Tarantula Nebula</a>\nleft of center, is by far the LMC's largest star forming region.\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is about 15,000 light-years across.",
