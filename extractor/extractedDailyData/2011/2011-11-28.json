  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAsteroid Vesta is home to some of the most impressive cliffs in the Solar System.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14716\">Pictured above</a> near the image center is a very\n<a href=\"ap110404.html\">deep cliff</a> running about 20 kilometers from top to bottom.\n\nThe image was taken by the\n<a href=\"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/\">robotic Dawn spacecraft</a>\nthat began orbiting the\n<a href=\"ap110919.html\">500-kilometer space rock</a> earlier this year.\n\nThe topography of the\n<a href=\"ap080723.html\">scarp</a>\nand its surroundings indicates that <a href=\"http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2011/10/14/a-very-large-landslide-on-the-vesta-asteroid-and-a-challenge-for-you/\">huge landslides</a> may have occurred\n<a href=\"ap080311.html\">down</a> this slope.\n\nThe scarp's origin remains unknown, but parts of the cliff face itself must be quite old as several craters have appeared in it since it was created.\n\n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00003243/\">Dawn has now finished</a> up its high altitude mapping survey and will  spiral down to a lower altitude orbit to better explore the asteroid's\n<a href=\"ap030723.html\">gravitational field</a>.  \n\nDuring 2012, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(spacecraft)\">\nDawn</a> is scheduled to blast away from\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUaoy33gHE\">Vesta</a> and begin a long journey to the only asteroid belt object known to be larger:\n<a href=\"ap060821.html\">Ceres</a>.",
