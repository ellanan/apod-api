  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's hovering between those buildings?\n\nThe Moon.  \n\nThe above image was taken two weeks ago as the\n<a href=\"http://www.farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/02/09/full-snow-moon/\">full Snow Moon</a> started to rise above\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton\">Edmonton</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta\">Alberta</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>.\n\nThe odd coincidence between the\n<a href=\"http://www.1728.org/angsize.htm\">angular size</a> of the\n<a href=\"ap071025.html\">far distant Moon</a>\nand the angular width of nearby buildings created a striking juxtaposition.\n\nBacking away from the buildings so to reduce their angular size was a key to planning the image.\n\nThe temperature was so low, -25\n<a href=\"http://www.sizes.com/units/temperature_centigrade.htm\">C</a>,\nthat plumes of steam rose from neighboring oil refineries.\n\nThe above image was taken during a momentary break in the plumes.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ifTCa97G6Q\">rising Moon</a> appears red here for the same reason that a setting\n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">Sun appears red</a> -- because blue light is preferentially\n<a href=\"http://www.weeklydavespeak.com/wdextra/audio/Davespeak/Messy%20Hair/Cat%20Hair.jpg\">scattered</a> away by intervening air.\n\nIn this case, the\n<a href=\"ap101019.html\">shimmering</a> steam plumes\nlikely also caused the Moon to appear\n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">slightly compressed</a>.\n\nThe next full moon, the\n<a href=\"http://www.farmersalmanac.com/full-moon-names/\">full Worm Moon</a>, will occur in mid-March.",
