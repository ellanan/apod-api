  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis dusty island universe is one of the brightest spiral galaxies in\n<a href=\"http://www.warrenastro.org/was/newsletter/\nwasp9811.html#1cont\">planet Earth's sky</a>.\n\nSeen nearly <a href=\"ap091121.html\">edge-on, NGC 253</a> is only\n13 million light-years away, the largest member of the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/sclgr.html\">Sculptor\nGroup</a> of galaxies,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2008/35/\">neighbor to</a> our own\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps.html\">local\ngalaxy group</a>.\n\nThe detailed\n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/\nNGC253-HST-Gendler.html\">close-up view is a five frame mosaic</a>\nbased on data assembled from the Hubble Legacy Archive. \n\nBeginning on the left near the galaxy's core, the sharp panorama\nfollows dusty filaments, interstellar gas clouds, and even individual\nstars toward the galaxy's edge at the right.\n\nThe magnificent vista spans nearly 50,000 light-years.\n\nThe frame at the far right has been compressed slightly\nto bring into view an\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/\n2008/33/\">intriguing pair</a> of background galaxies.\n\nDesignated a starburst galaxy because of its\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509430\">frantic star forming</a>\nactivity, NGC 253 features tendrils of dust rising from a\ngalactic disk laced with young star clusters and star forming regions.\n\nNGC 253 is also known to be a strong\n<a href=\"ap010607.html\">source of high-energy x-rays</a> and\ngamma rays, likely due to massive black holes near the galaxy's center.",
