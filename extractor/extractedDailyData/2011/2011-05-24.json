  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow many arches can you count in the above image?\n\nIf you count both spans of the \n<a href=\"http://www.360cities.net/image/inside-double-arch\">Double Arch</a> in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arches_National_Park\">Arches National Park</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>, then two. \n\nBut since the \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/goldpaint/5707263924/in/set-72157622614976024/\">above image</a> was taken during a clear dark night, it caught a photogenic third arch far in the distance -- that of the overreaching \n<a href=\"ap080713.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nBecause we are situated in the midst of the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows2universe.org/the_universe/Spirals.html\">spiral</a> Milky Way Galaxy, the band of the \n<a href=\"ap070930.html\">central disk</a> appears all around us.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_p3jjER6c\">sandstone arches</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Arch\">Double Arch were</a> formed from the erosion of falling water.\n\nThe larger arch rises over 30 meters above the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_Basin\">surrounding salt bed</a> and spans close to 50 meters across.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap090516.html\">dark silhouettes</a> across the image bottom are sandstone monoliths left over from silt-filled crevices in an evaporated 300 million year old salty sea.  \n\nA dim flow created by light pollution from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab,_Utah\">Moab, Utah</a> can also be seen in the distance.",
