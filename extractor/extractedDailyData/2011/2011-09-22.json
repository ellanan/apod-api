  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLinking spiral arms, two large colliding galaxies are\nfeatured in this remarkable cosmic portrait constructed using\nimage data from the\n<a href=\"http://hla.stsci.edu/\">Hubble Legacy Archive</a>.\n\nRecorded in astronomer Halton Arp's Atlas of\n<a href=\"http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/\nArp_contents.html\">Peculiar Galaxies</a> as Arp 272, the\npair is otherwise known as\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/16/\nimage/al/\">NGC 6050</a> near center, and IC 1179 at upper right.\n\nA third galaxy, likely also a member of the interacting system,\ncan be spotted above and left of larger spiral NGC 6050.\n\nThey lie some 450 million light-years away in the\n<a href=\"ap070719.html\">Hercules Galaxy Cluster</a>.\n\nAt that estimated distance, the picture spans over 150 thousand\nlight-years.\n\nAlthough this\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?\nbibcode=1972ApJ...178..623T&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=3c862d41db22593\">scenario\ndoes</a> look peculiar,\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/\">galaxy\ncollisions</a>\nand their eventual mergers are now understood to be common,\nwith Arp 272 representing a stage in this inevitable process.\n\nIn fact, the nearby large spiral\n<a href=\"ap080124.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a> is known\nto be approaching our own galaxy and Arp 272 may offer a glimpse of\nthe far future collision between\n<a href=\"http://www.galaxydynamics.org/tflops.html\">Andromeda and\nthe Milky Way</a>.",
