  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat are those streaks in the sky?\n\nThey're meteors from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draconids\">Draconids</a> \nmeteor shower that peaked earlier this month.\n\nThe above composite image captured numerous meteor streaks over 90 minutes above the <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.higuerareal.org%2Fpueblo%2Fcapote.htm\">Celtic ruins of Capote</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Badajoz\">Badajoz</a> province, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nThe particles that caused these meteors were typically the size of a pebble and were expelled long ago from the nucleus of \n<a href=\" http://cometography.com/pcomets/021p.html\">comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner</a>. \n\nMost of the above meteors can be traced back to a single \n<a href=\"ap031116.html\">radiant</a> emanating from the \nconstellation of the Dragon \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_%28constellation%29\">Draco</a>).  \n\nReports from this year's meteor shower indicate that the Draconids were \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/space/report-on-october-8-2011-draconid-meteor-shower\">unusually good</a> this year with \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzaqZ2a4D68\">activity</a> \nwas concentrated around 8 pm \n<a href=\"http://www.time.gov/timezone.cgi?UTC/s/0/java\">UT</a> on October 8.  \n\nThe most intense \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/legendary-draconids-boom-or-bust\">Draconid meteor showers</a> in recent history occurred in 1933 and 1946 when thousands of meteors per hour were \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0ukHuhQZ_Q\">recorded</a> \nas the Earth plowed through particularly dense streams of comet debris.\n\nAlthough the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPdQ_dQ0N50\">Draconids</a> occur every October, it is usually difficult to know just how active each year's meteor shower will be.",
