  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt is difficult to hide a galaxy behind a cluster of galaxies.\n\nThe closer cluster's gravity will act like a\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/generalrelativity/GravitationalLensPointSim.html\">huge lens</a>, pulling images of the distant galaxy around the sides and greatly distorting them.\n\nThis is just the case observed in the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2011/25/image/a/\">above recently released image</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/~postman/CLASH/About.html\">CLASH survey</a> with the\n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nThe cluster\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fNlS_tzBm4\">MACS J1206.2-0847</a> is composed of many galaxies and is lensing the image of a yellow-red background galaxy into the\n<a href=\"ap090921.html\">huge arc</a> on the right.\n\nCareful inspection of the image will reveal at least several other lensed background galaxies -- many appearing as elongated wisps.\n\nThe foreground\n<a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/gal_lss.html\">cluster</a> can only create such smooth arcs if most of its mass is smoothly distributed\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter/index.html\">dark matter</a> -- and therefore not concentrated in the cluster galaxies visible.\n\nAnalyzing the positions of these\n<a href=\"ap100620.html\">gravitational arcs</a>  also gives astronomers a <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1107.2649Z\">method to estimate</a> the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJN2X3NrQAE\">dark matter</a> distribution in galaxy clusters, and infer from that when these\n<a href=\"ap100502.html\">huge conglomerations of galaxies</a>\nbegan to form.",
