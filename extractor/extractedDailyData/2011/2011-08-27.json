  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow does a hurricane form?  \n\nAlthough a complete picture is still being researched, insight into this process might be gleaned by watching the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kodHrn5FO-w\">above time lapse movie</a> of the formation of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irene\">Hurricane Irene</a>, a large storm system currently threatening the\n<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177372/Eastern-Seaboard\">eastern seaboard</a> of the USA.\n\nStarting as a\n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/hurricanes/\">slight pressure difference</a> visible as nondescript clouds on the lower right, Hurricane Irene is shown growing into large spiraling storm system of low pressure off the coast of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina\">South Carolina</a>.  \n\nA hurricane is powered by\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGjwe-BCfms\">evaporating</a> ocean water, and so typically gains strength over warm water and loses strength over land.\n\nBesides Earth, other planets that have hurricane-like storm systems include\n<a href=\"ap100928.html\">Venus</a>,\n<a href=\"ap061113.html\">Saturn</a>,\n<a href=\"ap110502.html\">Jupiter</a>,\n<a href=\"ap041118.html\">Uranus</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap011201.html\">Neptune</a>.  \n\nMuch remains unknown about\n<a href=\"http://www.hurricaneville.com/faq.html\">hurricanes and cyclones</a>, including the exact path they will take.",
