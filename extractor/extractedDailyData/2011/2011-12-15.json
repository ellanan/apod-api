  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe dark, inner shadow of planet Earth\nis called <a href=\"ap060909.html\">the umbra</a>.\n\nShaped like a cone extending into space, it has a\ncircular cross section most easily seen during a\n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/LEprimer.html\">lunar eclipse</a>.\n\nFor example, last Saturday the <a href=\"ap080220.html\">Full Moon slid</a>\nacross the southern half of Earth's umbral shadow,\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=26135\">entertaining\nmoonwatchers</a> around much of the planet.\n\nIn the total phase of the eclipse, the Moon was completely within\nthe umbra for 51 minutes.\n\nRecorded from Beijing, China, this composite eclipse image uses\n<a href=\"ap070901.html\">successive</a> pictures from totality (center)\nand partial phases to trace out a large part of the\numbra's <a href=\"ap080820.html\">curved edge</a>.\n\nBackground stars are visible in the <a href=\"ap110621.html\">darker</a>\neclipse phases.\n\nThe result shows the relative size of the shadow's\ncross section at the distance of the Moon, as well as the Moon's path\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/\ndec2011-eclipse.html\">through Earth's umbra</a>.",
