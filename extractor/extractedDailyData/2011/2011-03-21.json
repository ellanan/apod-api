  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow could part of the early universe be so cold?  \n\nNo one is sure, and many astronomers now think that the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot\">CMB Cold Spot</a> on the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation\">cosmic microwave background</a> (CMB) radiation is not particularly noteworthy.\n\nAs the <a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_01.htm\">early universe</a> expanded and cooled, it suddenly and predictably became transparent.\n\nThe photons that come to us from \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18002\">that epoch</a> \nare seen all around us as the CMB.\n\nNow this radiation field is quite uniform but does have slight warm and cool spots that tell us a great deal about the \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21855\">early universe</a> that could have imprinted them.\n\nExcept, possibly, one spot.  \n\nThis CMB Cold Spot, circled above on the \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/101080/index.html\">WMAP 7-year all-sky map</a>, has attracted attention as possibly being too large and too cold to be easily explained.\n\nPublished speculation has included \nspectacular progenitor hypotheses that involve a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...714..825G\">super</a><a href=\"ap070827.html\">void</a>, \na <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AdAst2010E..77V\">cosmic texture</a>, or even \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21305\">quantum entanglement</a> with a \n<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626311.400\">parallel universe</a>.\n\nQuite possibly, though, even a \n<a href=\"ap091101.html\">more mundane universe</a> might be expected to show such a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BckBq1rMEOg\">statistical peculiarity</a>, and so explanations of the CMB Cold Spot like these \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcrEqIpi6sg\">might say</a> \nmore about \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test\">human imagination</a> than the early universe.",
