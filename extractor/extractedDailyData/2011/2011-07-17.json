  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nYou could be the first person ever to take a real single-exposure image like this.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://homepage.univie.ac.at/peter.wienerroither/pwafoxe.htm\">above image</a> from Vienna, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria\">Austria</a> is not real in the sense that the 360 degree star trails in the sky appear only because of a digital trick.\n\nReal star trails observed above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna\">Vienna</a> could never go 360 degrees around because the Sun would rise at some time during the exposure and dominate the frame.\n\n<a href=\"ap101224.html\">Star trails</a> of any length occur because as the Earth spins on its axis, the sky seems to rotate around us. \n\nThis motion, called \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">diurnal motion</a>, \nproduces the beautiful concentric \n<a href=\"ap101224.html\">arcs traced</a> by stars during long time exposures.  \n\nTowards the middle of the above digitally stretched picture is the <a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Classroom/Lessons/Sundials/skydome.html\">North Celestial Pole</a> (NCP), easily identified as the point in the sky at the center of all the star trail arcs. \n\nThe star <a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a>, \ncommonly known as the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_star\">North Star</a>, made the very short bright circle near the NCP.  \n\n<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/lewin_walter.html\">Walter Lewin</a>, though, has asked <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apod\">APOD</a> to pose this as a \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=110717\">challenge to astrophotographers</a>: create a real single-exposure image of a clear night sky that features 360 degree star trails.  \n\nOf course, such an image would only be possible near the poles of our fair planet, because only there could a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night\">nighttime run</a> for more than 24 hours.",
