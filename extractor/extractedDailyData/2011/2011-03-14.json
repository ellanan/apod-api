  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen a \"star\" drifting slowly overhead, but not known what it was?\n\nSometimes even pointing it out to friends or family will only lead to a <a href=\"http://www.ballet.co.uk/images/nycb/pk_the_concert_maria_kowroski_high_umbrella_shrug_500.jpg\">shrug</a>.\n\nWhat you are seeing, most likely, is a spacecraft in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit\">low Earth orbit</a> \nreflecting back sunlight as it circles the Earth once every 90 minutes or so.\n\nTwo of the <a href=\"ap110310.html\">brighter spacecraft</a> in the present day sky are the International Space Station (ISS), and, when it is up, a NASA space shuttle.\n\nAs relative orientations change, the brightness of reflections may also change, sometimes suddenly. \n\nAnother source of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dPfvvtll7M\">bright drifting objects</a>, \nIridium communication satellites, may even appear to \n<a href=\"ap000502.html\">flare up</a> to become brighter than any other sky object for a few seconds.\n\n<a href=\"http://barn.zenfolio.com/p1068266116/hb478f55#hb478f55\">Pictured above</a>, two bright points of light separated by only a few degrees drifted together across the sky above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lory_State_Park\">Lory State Park</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado\">Colorado</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIekamBDiAw\">USA</a> last week, just after sunset.\n\nThese lights were were the \n<a href=\"ap110301.html\">ISS and the space shuttle Discovery</a>, \nwhich had undocked from the \n<a href=\"ap110309.html\">ISS</a> a few hours earlier.\n\nGiven a digital fusion of many separate camera exposures and a wide angle perspective,\nthe pair appears above as streaks in front of point-like stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.heavens-above.com/\">Web sites</a> now exist that can help you identify \n<a href=\"ap070815.html\">unknown \"drifters\"</a> and even predict the time of the next pass of the ISS visible from your location.",
