  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat's that bright orange dot above the large telescope on the right?\n\nEven seasoned sky enthusiasts might\n<a href=\"ap101213.html\">ponder</a> the origin of the orange orb seen by\n<a href=\"http://blogs.families.com/media/\ncatncompuermouse.jpg\">scrolling</a> across\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1119a/\">this\npanoramic image</a>, taken last December.\n\nPerhaps identifying known objects will help.  \n\nTo start, on the far left is a diagonal band of light known as\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light\">zodiacal light</a>,\nsunlight reflected off of dust orbiting in the inner Solar System.\n\nThe bright white spot on the left, just above the horizon, is\n<a href=\"ap101020.html\">Venus</a>, which also glows by reflected sunlight.  \n\nRising diagonally from the ground to the right of Venus is the band of our\n<a href=\"http://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way\nGalaxy</a>.\n\nIn the image, the band, which usually\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj8n_95_yNc\">stretches dramatically</a> overhead, appears to arch above the elevated\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>an landscape.\n\nUnder the Milky Way arch, toward the left, lie both the <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/multiwavelength_astronomy/multiwavelength_museum/lmc.html\">Large</a> and Small\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds\">Magellanic Cloud</a>\ngalaxies, while toward the right lies the\nconstellation of Orion surrounded by the red ring of\n<a href=\"ap101023.html\">Barnard's Loop</a>.\n\nOn the ground, each of the four\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt.html\">Very Large Telescopes</a> is busy keeping an eye on the distant universe.\n\nThe orange spot -- it's the Moon.  \n\nThe image was taken during a\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/81716/\ntotal-lunar-eclipse-december-21-2010/\">total lunar eclipse</a>\nwhen the normally bright full moon turned into a faint\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/\n13feb_lunareclipse/\">orb tinted orange</a>\nby the intervening Earth's atmosphere.",
