  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA nearby star has exploded and telescopes all over the world are turning  to monitor it.  \n\nThe supernova, dubbed PTF 11kly, was discovered by computer only two days ago as part of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/\">Palomar Transient Factory</a> (PTF) sky survey utilizing the wide angle 1.2-meter\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/oschin_telescope.htm\">Samuel Oschin Telescope</a> in California.  \n\nIts <a href=\"http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=3581\">rapid recovery</a> makes it one of the supernovas caught most soon after ignition.  \n\n<a href=\"http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2011/08/25/supernova/\">PTF 11kly</a> occurred in the\n<a href=\"ap110415.html\">photogenic</a>\n<a href=\"ap091230.html\">Pinwheel</a>\n<a href=\"ap090414.html\">galaxy</a>\n(<a href=\"ap060302.html\">M101</a>), which, being only about 21 million\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away, makes it one of the closest supernovas seen in decades.  \n\nRapid follow up observations have already given a clear indication that PTF 11kly is a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1a_supernova\">Type Ia supernova</a>, a type of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf\">white dwarf</a> detonation that usually progresses in such a standard manner than it has helped to calibrate the\n<a href=\"ap061224.html\">expansion history</a> of the entire universe.  \n\nStudying such a close and young\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZkAoR3WLE\">Type Ia</a> event, however, may yield new and unique clues.\n\nIf early indications are correct,\n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/25/astroalert-type-ia-supernova-in-m101/\">PTF 11kly</a> should brighten to about visual magnitude 10 in the coming weeks, making it possible to monitor with even moderately sized telescopes.",
