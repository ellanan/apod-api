  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is causing these dark streaks on Mars?\n\nA leading hypothesis is flowing -- but quickly evaporating -- water.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfBaM2F6Qzk\">streaks</a>,\nvisible in dark brown near the image center, appear in the\nMartian spring and summer but\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/576957main_pia14475-fullsize.gif\">fade in the winter months</a>, only to reappear again the next summer.\n\nThese are not the first\n<a href=\"ap030205.html\">markings on Mars</a> that have been interpreted as\n<a href=\"ap021024.html\">showing the effects</a> of running water, but they are the first to add the clue of a seasonal dependence.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14479\">above picture</a>, taken in May, digitally combines several images from the the HiRISE instrument on the\n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (MRO).\n\nThe image is color-enhanced and depicts a slope inside\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(Martian_crater)\">Newton crater</a>  \nin a mid-southern region of Mars.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/04/more-evidence-of-flowing-water-on-mars/\">streaks bolster</a> evidence that water exists just below the Martian surface in several locations, and therefore fuels <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_sagan.html\">speculation</a> that Mars might harbor some sort of <a href=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/04/article-0-0BE620CD00000578-265_634x797.jpg\">water-dependent life</a>.  \n\nFuture observations with\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Current_missions\">robotic spacecraft orbiting Mars</a>, such as MRO,  \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/index.html\">Mars Express</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/\">Mars Odyssey</a>\nwill continue to monitor the situation and possibly confirm -- or refute -- the exciting\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRDpTEjumdo\">flowing water</a> hypothesis.",
