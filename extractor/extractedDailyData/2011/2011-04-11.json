  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat would a sunrise look like on another world?\n\nSo far, humanity has only recorded sunrises on\n<a href=\"ap090110.html\">Mars</a> and\n<a href=\"ap080320.html\">Earth</a>,\nbut it is fun to wonder what they would look like on\n<a href=\"ap110329.html\">planets known</a> and\n<a href=\"ap080521.html\">yet unknown</a>.\n\nPlanets far from their parent star would record the rise of an unusually bright point of light rather than a round orb.   \n\nAlthough this might appear to be what is\npictured above, the\ncareful combination of long exposures and creative lighting\nis actually based on\n<a href=\"ap080202.html\">Venus-rise</a> from planet Earth a few weeks ago,\ncaptured through\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmR3hvTGfbk\">Mesa Arch</a> in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyonlands_National_Park\">Canyonlands National Park</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/states_experiment_drag-drop_Intermed_State15s_500.html\">USA</a>.\n\nPicturesque\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte\">buttes</a> and\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa\">mesas</a> dot the background landscape.\n\nThe orange sky is created by air scattering and dust,\nbut is likely reminiscent of dusty\n<a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/\n14C.html\">skyscapes on Mars</a>.  \n\nSunrise was set to occur a few minutes hence, and did indeed involve a\n<a href=\"ap100609.html\">round orb</a>.",
