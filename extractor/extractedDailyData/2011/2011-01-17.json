  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHas a new planet been discovered?    \n\nWhat is pictured above is a remarkable 24 hour mosaic surrounding a spot on \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion\">Sounio</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>, right here on \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">planet Earth</a>.\n\nImages taken at night compose the top half of \n<a href=\"http://www.greeksky.gr/files/photos/landscapes/20101230Sounio24.htm\">the picture</a>, with \n<a href=\"http://www.danheller.com/star-trails.html\">star trails</a> \nlasting as long as 11 hours visible.  \n\nContrastingly, images taken during the day compose the bottom of the image, with the Sun being captured once every 15 minutes.  \n\nThe image center shows a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince\">Little Prince</a> wide angle projection centered on the ground but including gravel, grass, trees, \n<a href=\"ap100315.html\">Saint John's church</a>, clouds, crepuscular rays, and even a signature icon of the photographer -- the \n<a href=\"ap100118.html\">Temple of Poseidon</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w\">Meticulous planning</a> \nas well as several transition shots and expert digital processing eventually culminated in \n<a href=\"http://greeksky.gr/GreekSkyForum/index.php?topic=2.0\">this image documenting</a> half of the final two days of last year.",
