  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA journey to the center of a red giant star is very firmly in the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nA_Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth\">realm of science fiction</a>.\n\nBut the science of\n<a href=\"http://kepler.nasa.gov/Science/about/RelatedScience/\nAsteroseismology/\">asteroseismology can explore</a> the\nconditions there.\n\nThe technique is to time the small variations in a star's\nbrightness measured by the\n<a href=\"ap110329.html\">planet hunting Kepler</a> spacecraft.\n\nRegular variations indicate stellar oscillations, analogous to\n<a href=\"http://positron.ps.uci.edu/~dkirkby/music/html/demos/\nPlaneWave/SoundWave.html\">sound waves</a>,\nthat compress and\ndecompress the gas causing brightness changes.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ster.kuleuven.be/outreach/press/redgiants/\">As\nrecently discovered in red giant stars</a>, some of the oscillations\ndetected have periods that would cause them to penetrate\nto the stellar core.\n\nIn that extreme environment they actually become more\nintense and can return to the surface.\n\nThese echoes from the red giant's core are illustrated in\nthis frame from a\n<a href=\"http://www.ster.kuleuven.be/~paulb/redgiants/\nmixedmodeanimation_readme.htm\">computer generated animation</a>.\n\nRemarkably, the\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5805\">periods measured</a>\nfor the oscillations can even indicate how and where the\nred giant star's energy production, by\n<a href=\"http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/\nlec16.html\">hydrogen or helium fusion</a>, is taking place.",
