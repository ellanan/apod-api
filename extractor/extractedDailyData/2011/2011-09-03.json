  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nComet Garradd continues to brighten as it drifts across the northern sky.\n\nLast week the comet, visible with binoculars and discernible by its \n<a href=\"ap091216.html\">green coma</a>, \npassed nearly in front of globular cluster M71.\n\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_71\">M71</a> was once thought to be an open cluster, but is now known to be an older \n<a href=\"ap110503.html\">globular cluster</a> \ncontaining over 10,000 stars.\n\nThe photogenic duo was captured with a standard digital camera in a 10-minute, wide-angle exposure toward the northern constellation of the Arrow (Sagitta).  \n\nThe stars \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sagittae\">Sham</a> (alpha Sagittae), \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/betasge.html\">beta Sagittae</a>, \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/gammasge.html\">gamma Sagittae</a>, and the \n<a href=\"ap991002.html\">double star</a> \ndelta Sagittae are \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sagitta_IAU.svg\">all visible</a> in a diagonal band running down from the upper left.\n\nComet C/2009 P1 (Garradd), will \n<a href=\"http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK09P010\">remain visible</a> in northern skies for months and will reach its closest approach to the Sun in December.",
