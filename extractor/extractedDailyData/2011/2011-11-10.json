  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn 185 AD,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astronomy\">Chinese\nastronomers</a> recorded the appearance of\na new star in the Nanmen asterism -\na part of the sky identified\nwith Alpha and Beta Centauri on modern star charts.\n\nThe new star was visible for months and is\nthought to be the earliest\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301603\">recorded supernova</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\nmultiwavelength_astronomy/multiwavelength_astronomy/\">multiwavelength</a>\ncomposite image from orbiting telescopes of the 21st century,\nXMM-Newton and Chandra in X-rays, and Spitzer and WISE in infrared,\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/\n1324-ssc2011-09-NASA-Telescopes-Help-Solve-Ancient-Supernova-Mystery\">shows\nRCW 86</a>, understood to be the remnant of that\n<a href=\"ap060728.html\">stellar explosion</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/\n4777-nhsc2011-09b-All-Eyes-on-Oldest-Recorded-Supernova\">false-color view</a>\ntraces interstellar gas heated by the expanding supernova shock wave\nat X-ray energies (blue and green) and interstellar dust radiating at\ncooler temperatures in infrared light (yellow and red).\n\nAn abundance of the element iron and lack of a neutron star or pulsar\nin the remnant suggest that the original supernova was Type Ia.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia\nsupernovae</a> are thermonuclear explosions that\n<a href=\"ap110430.html\">destroy</a>\na white dwarf star as it accretes material from a companion\nin a binary star system.\n\nShock velocities\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1207\">measured in</a>\nthe X-ray emitting shell and infrared dust temperatures indicate that\nthe remnant is expanding extremely rapidly into a remarkable\nlow density bubble created before the explosion by the white dwarf system.\n\nNear the plane of our <a href=\"ap110520.html\">Milky Way</a> Galaxy,\nRCW 86 is about 8,200 light-years away and has an estimated radius\nof 50 light-years.",
