  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nToday the Sun stands still at 05:30 UT.\n\nHalting its steady march toward southern declinations and\nbegining its annual journey north, the event is known as\n<a href=\"http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/\ndata-services/earth-seasons/\">a solstice</a>.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere\n<a href=\"http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/\nastronomical-information-center/dark-days/\">December's solstice</a> marks\nthe astronomical start of winter.\n\nAnd <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxJ9vs7kHQE\">if you're in</a>\nthe Great Basin Desert outside of\nLucin, Utah, USA, near solstice dates you can watch the Sun rise\nand set through\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Holt#Sun_Tunnels\">Sun Tunnels</a>.\n\nA monumental earthwork by artist Nancy Holt, the Sun Tunnels are\nconstructed of four 9 foot diameter cast concrete pipes each 18 feet long.\n\nThe tunnels are <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/\nmaps?ll=41.303518,-113.863758&amp;z=18&amp;t=k\">arranged in a wide X</a>\nto achieve the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/\nstory.php?storyId=5500934\">solstitial</a> sunset and sunrise alignments.\n\nIn this dramatic snapshot through a Sun Tunnel\nthe Sun is just on the horizon.\n\nThe cold, cloudy sunset was near the\n<a href=\"ap101231.html\">2010 winter solstice</a>.\n\nDuring daylight hours, holes in the sides of the pipes\nproject spots of sunlight on their interior walls,\nforming a map of the principal stars in the\n<a href=\"http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/\">constellations</a>\nDraco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn.\n\nFans of <a href=\"http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm\">planet\nearthworks</a> and\n<a href=\"ap110118.html\">celestial landart</a>\nshould note that the Sun Tunnels are about 150 miles by car from\nRobert Smithson's (Holt's late husband)\n<a href=\"ap101204.html\">Spiral Jetty</a>.",
