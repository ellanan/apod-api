  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo comet has ever been visited twice before.\n\nTherefore, the unprecedented pass of the \n<a href=\"http://stardustnext.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Stardust-NeXT spacecraft</a> \nnear <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempel_1\">Comet Tempel 1</a> \nearlier this week gave humanity a unique opportunity to see how the nucleus of a comet changes over time.  \n\nChanges in the \n<a href=\"ap100726.html\">nucleus of Comet Tempel 1</a> \nwere of particular interest because the comet was \n<a href=\"ap050705.html\">hit</a> with an \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dryvDlB1hWA\">impactor</a> \nfrom the passing \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Impact_%28spacecraft%29\">Deep Impact spacecraft</a> in 2005. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stardust/multimedia/version1/n30038te01.html\">Pictured above</a> is one digitally sharpened image of Comet Tempel 1 near the closest approach of \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/index.cfm?id=962\">Stardust-NeXT</a>.\n\nVisible are \n<a href=\"ap050706.html\">many features imaged in 2005</a>, including craters, ridges, and seemingly smoother areas.\n\nFew firm <a href=\"http://musicmazaa.com/images/joke/funnyimages/conclusions.jpg\">conclusions</a> are yet available, \nbut over the next few years astronomers who \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002917/\">specialize</a> in comets and the understanding the early Solar System will be poring over \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stardust/multimedia/version1/index.html\">these images</a> looking for new clues as to how \n<a href=\"ap050512.html\">Comet Tempel 1</a> is composed, how the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/main/\">2005 impact site</a> now appears, and how general features of the comet have evolved.",
