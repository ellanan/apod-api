  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHave you ever seen the band of our\n<a href=\"http://casswww.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>?\n\nChances are you have never seen it like this --\nnor could you.  \n\nIn a clear sky from a dark location at the right time, a\n<a href=\"ap011205.html\">faint band of light</a> is visible across the sky.\n\nThis <a href=\"ap070930.html\">band</a> is the disk of our\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/spir.html\">spiral galaxy</a>.  \n\nSince we are inside this disk, the band appears to encircle the Earth.  \n\nThe above spectacular picture of the Milky Way arch, however, goes where the <a href=\"http://webphysics.davidson.edu/physlet_resources/dav_optics/examples/eye_demo.html\">unaided eye</a> cannot.\n\nThe image is actually a deep digital fusion of nine photos that create a panorama fully 360 across.  \n\nTaken recently in\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIPGbwf3228\">Teide National Park</a> in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife\">Tenerife</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, the image includes the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teide_and_it%27s_CableCar_-_P1.jpg\">Teide volcano</a>, visible near the image center, behind a volcanic landscape that includes many large rocks.\n\nFar behind these Earthly structures are many sky wonders\nthat are visible to the unaided eye, such as the band of the Milky Way, the bright\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar-Phase-Diagram.png\">waxing Moon</a>\ninside the\n<a href=\"ap080713.html\">arch</a>, and the\n<a href=\"ap091014.html\">Pleiades</a> open\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18009\">star cluster</a>\n(can you find it?).\n\nThe deep exposure also brings out many sky wonders normally beyond\n<a href=\"ap091004.html\">human perception</a>, many of which are labelled on the <a href=\"image/1104/teidesky_casado_annotated_3000.jpg\">annotated image version</a>, including\n<a href=\"ap090224.html\">Barnard's Loop</a>,\nvisible above as the half red ring below the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a358QLi4Wgs\">Milky Way band</a>.",
