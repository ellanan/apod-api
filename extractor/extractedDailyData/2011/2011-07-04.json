  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nClouds and sky both show illuminating changes during this time lapse video from the south of Australia.\n\nIn the foreground are scenes visible over a rocky coastline toward the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean\">Southern Ocean</a>.\n\nDark clouds flow across the sky, sometimes from different directions, sometimes blocking background starlight, but other times causing stars to appear to flare as they move in front.\n\nIn the first sequence, looking toward the southwest, a nearly vertical band of \n<a href=\"ap090212.html\">zodiacal light</a> is seen at sunset just before the \n<a href=\"ap070930.html\">band</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> appears to settle into the sea.  \n\nSoon the unusual dark patch of the \n<a href=\"ap080707.html\">Coal Sack Nebula</a> can be seen on the Milky Way band, near the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopNfhvCkHU\">famous</a> Southern \n<a href=\"ap050129.html\">Cross</a>.\n\nLater, looking toward the southeast at about 2:10 in the video, \nOrion can be seen rising appearing nearly perpendicular to \n\n<a href=\"ap021225.html\">how it rises</a> in northern skies.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/24253126\">composite video</a>, winner of an award \n<a href=\"http://www.starmus.com/pages/en/winners-starmus-astro-photography-competition128.php\">STARMUS astrophotography competition</a>, took over a year to compile in 2009 and 2010 from over 30 hours of exposure.   \n\nMini-mystery: \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=110704\">what are those lights moving along the horizon?</a>",
