  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it look like to travel near the speed of light?\n\nStrange visual effects would appear as documented in the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQnHTKZBTI4\">above relativistically-accurate animation</a>.\n\nFirst of all, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity\">relativistic</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_aberration\">aberration</a> would cause objects to \n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/cship/aberration.html\">appear to bunch</a> \nup in front you.\n\nNext, the <a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm\">Doppler shift</a> would cause the <a href=\"ap090906.html\">colors</a> of forward objects to shift toward the blue, while things behind you would \n<a href=\"http://www.cbu.edu/~jvarrian/applets/doppler1/doppler.htm\">shift</a> toward the red.\n\nSimilarly, the world in front of you would seem to \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=20908\">move unusually</a> fast, while the world behind you \n<a href=\"http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/sr/sr.shtml\">would appear</a> to slow down.\n\nObjects to the sides will appear \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation\">rotated</a>, possibly enabling surfaces <a href=\"http://faraday.physics.utoronto.ca/PVB/Harrison/SpecRel/Flash/ContractInvisible.html\">normally hidden</a> from you to become visible.\n\nOf course, since constant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance\">motion is relative</a>, \nthe same effects would occur were you to \n<a href=\"http://www.old-picture.com/american-history-1900-1930s/pictures/Balancing-Act-001.jpg\">remain stationary</a> and the entire world advanced toward you.",
