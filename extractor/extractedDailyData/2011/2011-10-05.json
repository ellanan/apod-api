  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nDid a sun-diving comet just cause a solar explosion?\n\nProbably not. \n\nThis past weekend a <a href=\"http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/pickoftheweek/old/03oct2011/\">comet dove</a> toward the Sun and was followed very quickly by a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">Coronal Mass Ejection</a> (CMEs) from the other side of the Sun.\n\nThe first two sequences in the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N_tgA92M64\">above video</a> shows the spectacular unfolding of events as seen by the Sun-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOHO_satellite\">SOHO satellite</a>, while the same events were \n<a href=\"http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/browse/2011/10/01/ahead_20111001_cor2_512.mpg\">also</a> \n<a href=\"http://sungrazer.nrl.navy.mil/images/Sep30_krz_cor2b.mov\">captured</a> by both Sun-orbiting \n<a href=\"ap110207.html\">STEREO satellites</a>.\n\nNow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungrazing_comet\">sungrazer</a> comets that break up as they pass near the Sun are not all that rare -- \n<a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jds/klist.htm\">hundreds</a> have been cataloged over the past few years.\n\n<a href=\"ap070206.html\">CME</a>s are even more common, with perhaps three lesser events occurring even during the eight hours of the above time-lapse movie.\n\nTherefore, the \n<a href=\"http://sungrazer.nrl.navy.mil/index.php?p=news/comets_cmes\">best bet</a> of solar scientists is that the two events were \n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4kkT22kuvoA/TJkQYYii62I/AAAAAAAAC0s/2S9jdoZv2rE/s400/coincidence-photography-reloaded12%5B1%5D.jpg\">unrelated</a>.\n\nAnother basis for this judgment is that CMEs are caused by rapid changes in the Sun's magnetic field, changes that a \n<a href=\"ap090322.html\">small comet</a> seem unlikely to make.  \n\nSuch <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/10/04/the-comet-and-the-coronal-mass-ejection/\">coincidences</a> are even more likely during periods of high activity on the Sun's surface -- like \n<a href=\"ap110928.html\">now</a>.",
