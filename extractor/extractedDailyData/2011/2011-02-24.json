  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSouth of the large star-forming region known as the\nOrion Nebula, lies bright blue reflection nebula\n<a href=\"ap000302.html\">NGC 1999</a>.\n\nAlso at the edge of the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/oricloud.html\">Orion molecular\ncloud</a> complex some 1,500 light-years distant, NGC 1999's\nillumination is provided by the\nembedded variable star V380 Orionis.\n\nThe nebula is marked with a dark sideways T-shape near center in this\n<a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/n1999.shtml\">broad\ncosmic vista</a> that spans over 10 light-years.\n\nThe dark shape was once assumed to be an obscuring dust cloud\nseen in silhouette against the bright reflection nebula.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFEAKPO8G_index_0.html\">But recent\ninfrared images</a>\nindicate the shape is likely a hole blown through the nebula\nitself by energetic young stars.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/latest/ngc1999about.html\">this\nregion abounds</a> with energetic young stars\nproducing jets and outflows that create luminous shock waves.\n\nCataloged as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, named for astronomers\nGeorge Herbig and Guillermo Haro,\nthe shocks appear bright red in\n<a href=\"http://skycenter.arizona.edu/news/109\">this view</a> that includes\nHH1 and HH2 just below NGC 1999.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/1995/24/astrofile/\">stellar jets</a> and\noutflows push through the surrounding\nmaterial at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per <i>second</i>.",
