  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you drop a hammer and a feather together, which reaches the ground first?\n\nOn the Earth, it's the hammer, but is the reason only because of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akWo3QpiL2I\">air resistance?</a>  \n\nScientists even before \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/galileo-experiments.html\">Galileo</a> have \n<a href=\"http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Humor/Cats/Curious.jpg\">pondered</a> \nand tested this simple experiment and felt that without air resistance, all objects would fall the same way.\n\n<a href=\"http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/intro.html\">Galileo</a> tested this principle himself and noted that two heavy balls of different masses reached the ground simultaneously, although many historians are skeptical that he did this experiment from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa\">Leaning Tower of Pisa</a> as folklore suggests.\n\nA good place free of air resistance to test this equivalence principle is \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">Earth's Moon</a>, and so in 1971, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/AS15/a15sum.htm\">Apollo 15</a> astronaut \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott\">David Scott</a> \ndropped both a \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/video15.html\">hammer and a feather together</a> toward the surface of the Moon.  \n\nSure enough, just as scientists including Galileo and \n<a href=\"ap000108.html\">Einstein</a> would have predicted, they reached the \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/\">lunar surface</a> at the same time.\n\nThe demonstrated \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle\">equivalence principle</a> states that the acceleration an object feels due to gravity does not depend on its mass, density, composition, color, shape, or anything else.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/18may_equivalenceprinciple/\">equivalence principle</a> is so important to <a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewforum.php?f=39\">modern physics</a> that its depth and reach are still being \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968PhRv..169.1014N\">debated</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/fundphys/step/\">tested</a> even today.",
