  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTo create a sonata from supernovae, first you have to\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1443\">find the supernovae</a>.\n\nTo do that composers Alex Parker and Melissa Graham\nrelied on the\n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHLS/\">Canada France\nHawaii Telescope (CFHT) Legacy Survey</a>\ndata of four deep fields on the sky\nmonitored from April 2003 through August 2006,\nadopting 241 Type Ia supernovae.\n\n<a href=\"ap110430.html\">Enchanting</a> to\n<a href=\"ap110330.html\">cosmologists</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia\nsupernovae</a> are\nthermonuclear explosions that destroy white dwarf stars.\n\nThen, they gave each supernova a note to play, \nthe volume of the note determined by the distance to the supernova.\n\nFainter, more distant supernovae play quieter notes.\n\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/\npitch.html\">Each note's pitch</a> was based on a\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104382\">stretch factor</a>\nmeasured by how fast the supernova brightens and fades over time\nrelative to a standard time history.\n\nHigher stretch factors play higher notes in \npitches drawn from the illustrated\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_dominant_scale\">Phrygian\ndominant scale</a>.\n\nOf course, each supernova note is played on an instrument.\n\nSupernovae in massive galaxies were assigned to a stand-up bass, while\nsupernovae in less massive galaxies played their note on a grand piano.\n\nClick on the image or follow these links\n(<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/23927216\">Vimeo</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h_ZrD7axi4\">YouTube</a>)\nto watch a time compressed animation of the CFHT Legacy Survey data\nwhile <a href=\"http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~alexhp/new/\nsupernova_sonata.html\">listening to the Supernova Sonata</a>.",
