  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo one knows for sure what caused this \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/software/unknown2.wav\">signal</a>.  \n\nThere is a slight possibility that it just might \noriginate from an \n<a href=\"ap000123.html\">extraterrestrial intelligence</a>.\n\nThe bright colors on the blue background indicate that an \nanomalous signal was received here on Earth by a \n<a href=\"ap981129.html\">radio telescope</a> \ninvolved in a \n<a href=\"http://www.seti.org/\">Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</a> (SETI).  \n\nA search for these signals is ongoing by \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/otherweb/othrseti.htm\">\nseveral groups</a> including volunteer members of the \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/general/faq.htm\">SETI League</a>.  \n\nTime labels the vertical axis of the \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/photos/hits.htm\">above plot</a>, \nand frequency marks the horizontal axis.  \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/photos/hits.htm\">\nthis strong signal</a> was never positively identified, \nastronomers have identified in it many attributes \ncharacteristic of a more mundane and ultimately\nterrestrial origin.  \n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/photos/hits.htm\">\nthis case</a>, a leading possibility is that the signal \noriginates from an unusual modulation between a \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/gps.htm\">GPS satellite</a> \nand an unidentified Earth-based source.\n\nMany <a href=\"http://www.setileague.org/photos/hits.htm\">\nunusual signals</a> from space remain unidentified.  \n\nNo <a href=\"ap980917.html\">signal</a> has yet been \nstrong enough or run long enough to be unambiguously \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjKBh8f1R8\">identified</a> as originating from an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_intelligence\">extraterrestrial intelligence</a>.",
