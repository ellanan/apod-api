  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis communication was not meant for human eyes.\n\nIt was not even meant for \n<a href=\"http://www.how-to-draw-funny-cartoons.com/cartoon-aliens.html\">aliens eyes</a>.\n\nIt's an attempt to communicate directly with your \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone\">smartphone</a>.\n\nCameras on many smartphones can image the above \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code\">Quick Response (QR) code</a> and then common applications can tell you what it means.  \n\nSometimes the deciphered code will reveal a web site address, prompting the smartphone to then ask you if you want to access this address to learn more about the object.\n\nQR codes are two-dimensional analogs of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_codes\">bar codes</a> that can be scanned in any orientation and tolerate several types of \n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Train_wreck_at_Montparnasse_1895.jpg\">error</a>s.\n\nThese codes are being used increasingly as \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRD4gb0p5RM&amp;t=26m20s\">doors</a> between real objects and web-based information about those objects, and so are popping up increasingly in \n<a href=\"http://funnydaze.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/qr-code-dog-sweater-custom-funny-picture.jpg\">unexpected places</a>.  \n\nAnyone can create a QR code from any of \n<a href=\"http://qrcode.kaywa.com/\">several</a> \n<a href=\"http://createqrcode.appspot.com/\">free</a> \n<a href=\"http://delivr.com/qr-code-generator\">online</a> \n<a href=\"http://goqr.me/\">services</a>, print it out, and affix it to an object.\n\nAlthough not meant to \n<a href=\"ap060402.html\">communicate with aliens</a>, QR codes employ several attributes common to \n<a href=\"ap050313.html\">famous alien communication attempt</a><a>s.  \n\nCan you -- or a local smartphone -- figure out \n</a><a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=111004\">what the above QR code means</a>?",
