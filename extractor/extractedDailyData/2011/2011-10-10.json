  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=111010\">Why would a rising Sun look so strange?</a>\n\nNo one is yet sure.  \n\nWhat is clear is that the above unusual sunrise was captured last month from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires\">Buenos Aires</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina\">Argentina</a>.\n\nThe body of water in the foreground is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_La_Plata\">Rio de La Plata</a>, considered by many to be the widest river in the world.\n\nAlthough the <a href=\"http://www.luisargerich.com/optiscapes/h1b5f4fbc#h1b5f4fbc\">above image</a> is actually a combination of a normal and a very short exposure needed to avoid \n<a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/13/15029998_fb5890e7d1.jpg\">oversaturating</a> the bright Sun, the photographer saw this unusual structure with his own eyes, indicating that this effect was caused by neither \n<a href=\"ap090804.html\">reflections</a> nor \n<a href=\"ap101207.html\">distortions</a> in the camera or lens.\n\nWhat looks like arms on this \n<a href=\"ap110425.html\">monster illusion</a> might actually be, for example, low level clouds just thick enough to scatter sunlight without completely \n<a href=\"ap110115.html\">blocking the Sun</a>.\n\nAdditionally, the distortion visible on the lower part of the Sun's image might indicate a \n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">Etruscan Vase</a> or \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_%28mirage%29\">Fata Morgana</a>\nmirage possibly created by a curious <a href=\" http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/10464/why-does-the-road-look-like-its-wet-on-hot-days\">refracting layer of air</a> over the water.\n\nUnusual <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/opod.htm\">atmospheric phenomena</a> are frequently \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh2tzXvBlJg\">thrilling to see</a> personally, and although most can be \n<a href=\"ap041207.html\">traced to well known phenomena</a>, \nothers, for lack of more data, \n<a href=\"ap070815.html\">remain mysterious</a>.",
