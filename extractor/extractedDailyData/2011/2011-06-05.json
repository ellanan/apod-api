  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOne of the brightest supernovas in recent years has just been recorded in the nearby Whirlpool galaxy (M51).\n\nSurprisingly, a seemingly\n<a href=\"ap050719.html\">similar supernova</a> was recorded in M51 during 2005, following yet another one that occurred in 1994.\n\nThree supernovas in 17 years is a lot for single galaxy, and reasons for the\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/\">supernova</a> surge in M51 are being debated.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cieletespace.fr/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/jld/snM51gif.gif\">Pictured above</a> are two images of\n<a href=\"ap091226.html\">M51</a> taken with a small telescope: one taken on May 30 that does not show the supernova, and one taken on June 2 which does.\n\nThe June 2 image is one of the first images reported to contain the supernova.  \n\nThe images are blinked to show the location of the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHjTb8Chq3k\">exploded star</a>.\n\nAlthough most supernovas follow\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Current_models\">classic brightness patterns</a>, the precise brightening and dimming pattern of this or any <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grwpeEyt_98\">supernova</a> is hard to predict in advance and can tell astronomers much about what is happening.  \n\nCurrently, the\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/123110228.html\">M51 supernova</a>, designated\n<a href=\"http://www.aavso.org/aavso-special-notice-242\">SN 2011dh</a>,  is still bright enough to <a href=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/03/new-supernova-spotted-in-whirlpool-galaxy/\">follow</a> with a small telescope.\n\nTherefore, sky enthusiasts are encouraged to image the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy\">Whirlpool galaxy</a>\nas often as possible to fill in time gaps left by intermittent observations made by the world's <a href=\"http://astro.nineplanets.org/bigeyes.html\">most powerful telescopes</a>.\n\nViews of the developing supernova are being\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=23856\">uploaded here</a>.",
