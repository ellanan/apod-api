  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's that rising from the clouds?  \n\nThe space shuttle.\n\nIf you looked out the window of an airplane at just the right place and time last week, you could have seen something very unusual -- the space shuttle Endeavour launching to orbit.  \n\n<a href=\"http://twitpic.com/4yg4ur\">Images</a> of the rising shuttle and its plume became widely circulated over the web shortly after \n<a href=\"ap110518.html\">Endeavour's final launch</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-134/html/sts134-s-061.html\">above image</a> was taken from a shuttle training aircraft and is not \n<a href=\"http://redtape.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/23/6703177-that-famous-space-shuttle-photo-when-is-sharing-stealing\">copyrighted</a>.\n\nTaken well above the clouds, the image can be matched with similar images of the same shuttle plume taken \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-134/html/sts134-s-013.html\">below the clouds</a>.  \n\nHot glowing gasses expelled by the engines are visible near the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X47raRdRSBA\">rising shuttle</a>, as well as a long smoke plume.  \n\nA <a href=\"ap070603.html\">shadow of the plume</a> appears on the cloud deck, indicating the direction of the Sun.\n\nThe shuttle \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134\">Endeavour remains docked</a> with the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">International Space Station</a> and is currently scheduled to return to Earth next week.",
