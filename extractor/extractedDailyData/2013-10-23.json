  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you climbed this magnificent tree, it looks like you could\nreach out and touch the <a href=\"ap120712.html\">North Celestial Pole</a>\nat the center of all the star trail arcs.\n\nThe well-composed image was recorded over a period of\nnearly 2 hours as a series of 30 second long, consecutive exposures\non the night of October 5.\n\nThe exposures were made with a digital camera fixed to a tripod near\nAlmaden de la Plata, province of Seville, in southern Spain,\nplanet Earth.\n\n<a href=\"ap120802.html\">Of course</a>, the graceful star trails\nreflect the Earth's daily rotation around its axis.\n\nBy extension, the axis of rotation\nleads to the center of the concentric arcs\n<a href=\"ap130920.html\">in the night sky</a>.\n\nConvenient for northern hemisphere\nnight sky photographers and celestial navigators alike, the\n<a href=\"ap110514.html\">bright star Polaris</a>\nis very close to the North Celestial\nPole and so makes the short bright trail in the central gap\nbetween the <a href=\"ap070519.html\">leafy branches</a>.",
