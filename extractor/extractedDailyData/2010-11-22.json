  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWas this image taken with a telescope or a microscope?\n\nPerhaps this clue will help: if the dark forms were \n<a href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/bacteria.html\">bacteria</a>, \nthey would each span over football field across.\n\nWhat is actually being seen are large sand dunes on the floor of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctor_%28Martian_crater%29\">Proctor Crater</a> on Mars.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13613\">above picture</a> was taken by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiRISE\">HiRISE camera</a> \non board the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/mission/index.html\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (MRO), \na robot spacecraft currently in orbit around Mars.\n\nThe dark rippled \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsX7qmrqu_0\">dunes</a> likely formed more recently than the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_soft_rock_musicians\">lighter rock</a> forms they appear to cover, and are thought to \n<a href=\"ap090420.html\">slowly shift</a> in response to pervasive \n<a href=\"ap990112.html\">wind</a>s.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004077_1325\">dunes</a> \n<a href=\"http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_004000_004099/PSP_004077_1325/PSP_004077_1325_RED.abrowse.jpg\">arise</a> from a complex relationship between the sandy surface and \n<a href=\"ap011017.html\">high winds</a> on Mars. \n\n<a href=\"ap010226.html\">Similar dunes</a> \nwere first seen in Proctor Crater by \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_09\">Mariner 9</a> more than 35 years ago.",
