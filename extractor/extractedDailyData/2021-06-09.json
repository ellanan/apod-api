  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis moon appears multiply strange. \n\nThis moon was a full moon, specifically&nbsp;called a \n<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-may\">Flower Moon</a> at this time of the year. \n\nBut that didn't make it strange -- full moons occur once a month \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month\">moon-th</a>). \n\nThis moon was a \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/922/what-is-a-supermoon/\">supermoon</a>, \nmeaning that it reached its full phase near its closest approach&nbsp;to the Earth in its slightly \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/orbit-3.jpg\">elliptical</a> orbit. \n\nSomewhat strange, a supermoon appears a bit larger and brighter than the average full moon -- \nand enables it to be called a Super Flower Moon.&nbsp;\n\nThis moon was undergoing a \n<a href=\"ap210525.html\">total lunar eclipse</a>.\n\nAn eclipsed moon can look \n<a href=\"https://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/funny-suprised-cat2.jpg\">quite strange</a>, being dark, \n<a href=\"ap201111.html\">unevenly lit, and, frequently, red</a> -- sometimes called blood red.\n\nTherefore, this moon could be called a Super Flower Blood Moon.\n\nThis moon was seen through thin clouds.\n\nThese clouds created a \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/cormoon.htm\">faint corona</a> \naround the moon, making it look not only strange, but \n<a href=\"ap150615.html\">colorful</a>. \n\nThis moon was imaged so deeply that the \n<a href=\"ap190407.html\">heart</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way galaxy</a>, far in the background, was visible to its lower right. \n\nThis moon, this shadow, this galaxy and these colors were all \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SeeingthroughHelmutEder/photos/a.104822107979211/297462595381827/\">captured</a> last month near \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassilis,_New_South_Wales\">Cassilis</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales\">NSW</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> -- with a single shot.  (Merged later with two lower shots that better capture the Milky Way.)",
