  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are these two bands in the sky?\n\nThe more commonly seen band is the one on the right and is the central band of \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html\">our Milky Way galaxy</a>.\n\nOur <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> orbits in the disk of this \n<a href=\"ap170917.html\">spiral galaxy</a>, so that from inside, this disk \n<a href=\"ap170328.html\">appears as a band</a> of comparable brightness all the way around the sky.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap110710.html\">Milky Way band</a> \ncan also be seen all year -- if out \n<a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2017/02/09/light-pollution-changes-view-orion-constellation/\">away from city lights</a>. \n\nThe less commonly seem band, on the left, is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light\">zodiacal light</a> -- \nsunlight reflected from dust orbiting the Sun in our Solar System. \n\n<a href=\"ap070925.html\">Zodiacal light</a> is brightest near the Sun and so is best seen just before sunrise or just after sunset. \n\nOn some evenings in the north, \nparticularly during the months of March and April, this ribbon of \n<a href=\"ap040825.html\">zodiacal light</a> \ncan appear quite prominent after sunset. \n\nIt has <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713..816N\">recently been determined</a> that \nzodiacal dust was mostly expelled by comets that have passed \n<a href=\"ap180226.html\">near Jupiter</a>. \n\nOnly on certain times of the year will the two bands be seen side by side, \nin parts of the sky, like this.  \n\nHere the two streaks of light appear like the continuation of the banks of the \n<a href=\"https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_�\">Liver River</a> into the sky.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rmsphotography95/photos/a.386953088074201.1073741828.386951604741016/1194712643964904/?type=3&amp;theater\">featured panorama</a> of consecutive exposures was recorded about three weeks ago in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Denmark_Region\">North Jutland</a>,  \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark\">Denmark</a>.",
