  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTwo hundred and twenty light years from Earth, planets are forming.  \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ufl.edu/news/\">Recent observations</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star</a> system <a href=\" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1991ApJ%2E%2E%2E383L%2E%2E79J&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=33613e8e5803356&amp;nosetcookie=1\">HR 4796</a> have shown that one of the stars is surrounded by a \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dusty</a> gaseous disk.  \n\nThis disk is of the right size, age, and density for \n<a href=\"ap980121.html\">dust</a> pellets to accrete surrounding matter.  \nA hole in the disk's center indicates that \nincreasingly larger condensates are colliding and sticking together, \ncoalescing into \n<a href=\"ap960304.html\">moons</a> and <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html\">planets</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ufl.edu/news/\">Pictured above</a> is a false-color image of the system, with the bright star <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1993ApJ%2E%2E%2E418L%2E%2E37J&amp;nosetcookie=1\">HR 4796A</a> indicated by a cross. The disk measures \nabout five times the size of \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">our Solar System</a>, and is seen nearly edge-on.\n\nHR 4796 is in the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/Centaurus.html\">southern constellation Centaurus.</a>",
