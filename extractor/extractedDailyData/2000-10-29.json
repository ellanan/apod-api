  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThese spots are the oldest, most distant structures known.\n\nThey are seen on the above two images of the microwave sky, north and south of our galaxy's equator, based on four-year's worth of data from NASA's \n<a href=\"http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/ed_resources.html\">COsmic Background Explorer</a> (COBE) satellite (1989-1993).  \n\nThe spots represent temperature variations in the \n<a href=\"ap000503.html\">early universe</a>.  \n\nAs our \n<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/CosmicMysteryTour.html\">universe expanded and cooled</a>, conglomerations of mass formed. \n\n<a href=\"http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/slide_captions.html\">These COBE images</a> confirmed that only a \nmillion years after the big-bang - \nwhich occurred roughly 15 billion years ago - parts of the \n<a href=\"http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/AppA/A1.html\">universe</a> \nwere visibly hotter than other parts. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v464n1/5018/sc0.html\">By studying the size and distribution</a> of the spots found on the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/faq_basic.html\">microwave background</a>, \nastronomers hope to learn what matter and \nprocesses caused the spots to form - and hence determine the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">composition, density, and future of our Universe</a>.  \n\nResults from \n<a href=\"ap000509.html\">recent measurements</a> \nof the cosmic microwave background are consistent with a \n<a href=\"ap980302.html\">universe stranger</a> than previously thought, \npossibly filled with \n<a href=\"ap981230.html\">unexpected</a> forms of \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9912211\">dark matter and dark energy</a>.  \n\nA more detailed analysis might result after \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> \nis launched in 2001.",
