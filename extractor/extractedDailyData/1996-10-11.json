  "explanation": "<b></b> The center of M31 is twice as unusual as previously\nthought.  In 1991 the Planetary Camera then onboard the <a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\npointed toward the center of our <a href=\"ap960605.html\">Milky Way</a>'s\nclosest major galactic neighbor: <a href=\"ap961009.html\">Andromeda (M31).</a>\n To everyone's surprise, M31's <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1993AJ....106.1436L\">nucleus showed a double structure</a>.\n The nuclear hot-spots are quite close together when considering\nGalactic distances: M31 is about 150,000 light years across while\nthe above shows only the central 30 light-years.  Subsequent ground-based\nobservations have led to speculation that indeed two nuclei exist,\nare <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995MNRAS%2E277L%2E%2E21G&amp;db_key=AST\">moving with respect to each other</a>,\nthat <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995BAAS%2E%2E186%2E4912C&amp;db_key=AST\">one nucleus is slowly tidally disrupting the other</a>,\nand <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/pubinfo/tiff/m31c.txt\">that one nucleus may be the remains of smaller galaxy \"eaten\" by M31</a>.\n The nuclei of many galaxies, including M31, are known to be <a href=\"ap960824.html\">quite violent places</a>,\nand the existence of massive <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html\">black holes</a>\nare frequently postulated to explain them.",
