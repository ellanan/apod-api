  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could stand on Mars -- what might you see? \n\nIf you were the \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\">Curiosity rover</a>, \nthen just last month you would have contemplated the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21256\">featured image</a> -- \na breathtaking panorama of the lower portion of \n<a href=\"ap140308.html\">Mount Sharp</a>.\n\nThe colors have been adjusted to mimic lighting familiar to \n<a href=\"ap130306.html\">Earthlings</a>. \n\nSurveyed here was a rocky plain before increasingly high rolling hills.\n\nThe rounded hills in the middle distance, called the Sulfate Unit, are \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6t1kxX-EpI\">Curiosity</a>'s \nhighest currently planned destination.\n\nOne reason these \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130312.html\">hills are interesting</a> is because sulfates are an energy source for \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate-reducing_bacteria\">some micro-organisms</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/\">immediate path forward</a>, though, was toward the southeast on the left part of the image.",
