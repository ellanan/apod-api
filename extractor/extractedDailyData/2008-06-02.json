  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs that ice under the Phoenix spacecraft on Mars?    \n\n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/05_31_pr.php\">Quite possibly</a>.  \n\nPhoenix, which <a href=\"ap080525.html\">landed</a> a week ago, \nwas expected to dig under the Martian soil to search for ice, \nbut the lander's braking rockets may already have uncovered some during descent.\n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10741\">Pictured above</a> \nis an image taken last week by the \n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science_rac.php\">Robotic Arm Camera</a> \nshowing the unusual light-colored substance just in front of \n<a href=\"ap080527.html\">Phoenix's landing pad</a>.\n\nOver the next few weeks, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_%28spacecraft%29\">Phoenix</a> \nwill continue to photograph its surroundings, analyze the composition of this \nhard light substrate, and dig into the surrounding soil.  \n\nWere the <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001481/\">unusual light substrate</a> indeed Martian ice, it would give Phoenix a convenient pedestal to investigate the history of \n<a href=\"ap050401.html\">water on Mars</a>, and to better determine whether the boundary between <a href=\"ap050720.html\">ice</a> and soil was ever capable of \n<a href=\"http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science03.php\">supporting life</a>.",
