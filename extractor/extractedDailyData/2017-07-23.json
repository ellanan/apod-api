  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMercury had never been seen like this before. \n\nIn 2008, the robotic \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER#/media/File:MESSENGER_-_spacecraft_at_mercury_-_atmercury_lg.jpg\">MESSENGER spacecraft</a> buzzed past \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)\">Mercury</a> \nfor the second time and imaged terrain mapped previously only by \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007SSRv..132..307H\">comparatively crude radar</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2004-030A\">featured image</a> was recorded as \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> looked back 90 minutes after passing, \nfrom an altitude of about 27,000 kilometers.\n\nVisible in the image, among many other newly imaged features, \nare unusually long \n<a href=\"ap080204.html\">rays</a> that appear to run like \n<a href=\"http://www.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog140/lectures/geographicgrid.html\">meridians</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/john-harrisons-longitude-clock-sets-new-record-300-years-on-10187304.html\">longitude</a> \nout from a young crater near the northern limb.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> entered orbit around Mercury in 2011 and finished its primary mission in 2012, but took \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwD31EDFjc\">detailed measurements</a> until 2015, at which time it ran out of fuel and so was instructed to \n<a href=\"ap150501.html\">impact Mercury's surface</a>.",
