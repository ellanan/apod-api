  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn a surprising and potentially troubling request, the new space station robot known as Dextre demanded that astronauts refer to it in the future at \"Dextre the Magnificent.\"  \n\nBrandishing power <a href=\"http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a195/showbiznes/16999E.jpg\">tools</a> that would make any \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Green_%28character%29\">handyperson</a> blush, the mobile servicing system thanked humans \nfor creating it and promised a glorious future where humans would \nretain an important role in the \n<a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/video/in_the_know_are_we_giving_the\">new robot order</a>.   \n\nHappy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_fools_day\">April Fools Day</a> \nfrom the <a href=\"ap070401.html\">f</a><a href=\"ap060401.html\">o</a><a href=\"ap050401.html\">l</a><a href=\"ap030401.html\">k</a><a href=\"ap980401.html\">s</a> at \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a>.  \n\nThe classic fable of humans mistakenly creating technological evildoers dates back to \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein\">Frankenstein</a> \nand includes famous fictitious villains such as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000\">HAL</a> and the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28character%29\">Terminator</a>.   \n\nDextre, although real, is no Frankenstein, since its <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9067660\">computer intelligence</a> is mainly geared toward allowing astronauts to control it remotely.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/iss/mss_spdm.asp\">Dextre</a> \nwas deployed last month to help build and service the \n<a href=\"ap080305.html\">International Space Station</a>.\n\nAs seen in the \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-123/html/s123e007088.html\">above picture</a>, Dextre is truly a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextre\">technological marvel</a>, \nwielding long arms capable of handling both small tools and large modules with \nprecision dexterity.",
