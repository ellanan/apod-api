  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nCurrently sweeping through southern skies,\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2012F6/2012F6.html\">Comet\nLemmon (C/2012 F6)</a> was\nnamed for its discovery last year as part of the Mount Lemmon (Arizona)\nSurvey.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/todays-image/\ncomet-lemmon-brighter-than-expected\">Brighter than expected</a>\nbut still just below naked-eye\nvisibility, Comet Lemmon sports a stunning lime green\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_%28cometary%29\">coma</a>\nand faint\ndivided tail in this telescopic\n<a href=\"http://www.atscope.com.au/BRO/gallery222.html\">image from\nFebruary 4</a>.\n\nThe greenish tint comes\nfrom the coma's diatomic C2 gas fluorescing in sunlight.\n\nCaptured from an observatory near Sydney, Australia, the color composite\nis constructed from a series of individual exposures registered on the\ncomet.\n\nAcross the 1 degree wide field of view, the star trails are a\nconsequence of the comet's relatively rapid motion against the\nbackground of stars near the\n<a href=\"ap120802.html\">South Celestial Pole</a>.\n\nMoving north, the\ncomet should grow brighter, reaching a peak (3rd magnitude or so)\nwhen it is\n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=c%2F2012%20F6\">closest\nto the Sun in</a> late March.\n\nBy early April it should be visible from the northern\nhemisphere.\n\nOf course, this year Comet Lemmon may be just another pretty\ncomet as skygazers on planet Earth\nalso eagerly anticipate views of\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/\nUpdate-on-Comet-PanSTARRS-187930541.html\">Comet PANSTARRS</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/news/\nasteroid20130205.html\">Comet ISON</a>.",
