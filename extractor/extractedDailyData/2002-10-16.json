  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe remnants of \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power.htm\">nuclear reactors</a> nearly two billion years old were \nfound in the 1970s in Africa.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/centre/waisrc/OKLO/index.shtml\">These reactors</a> are thought to have occurred naturally.\n\nNo natural reactors exist today, as the relative density of \n<a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/fissile-material.html\">fissile</a> \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/92.html\">uranium</a> has now decayed below that needed for a \nsustainable reaction. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/centre/waisrc/OKLO/What/Zone15.html\">Pictured above</a> is Fossil Reactor 15, located in Oklo, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gb.html\">Gabon</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://mineral.galleries.com/minerals/oxides/uraninit/uraninit.htm\">Uranium oxide</a> remains are visible as the yellowish rock.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/centre/waisrc/OKLO/Where/Where.html\">Oklo</a> by-products are being used today to \nprobe the stability of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.psu.edu/~cwc/qsogroup/alpha/\">fundamental constants</a> over cosmological \n<a href=\"http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/centre/waisrc/OKLO/When/When.html\">time-scales</a> and to develop more effective means \nfor disposing of human-manufactured \n<a href=\"http://www.nwtrb.gov/\">nuclear waste</a>.",
