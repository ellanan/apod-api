  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt's back, and it's bigger than ever.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk/tour/\">ozone hole</a> that has been a cause of \nconcern in recent years has again \n<a href=\"http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/eptoms/epanim98.html\">reformed</a> over \n<a href=\"ap951222.html\">Earth's South Pole</a>.  \n\nThe seasonal recurrence of the \n<a href=\"http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/eptoms/today.html\">ozone hole</a> was expected, although the size of the hole has \n<a href=\"ftp://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/pao/releases/1998/98-159.htm\">never been so large</a> this early in the season. \n\n<a href=\"http://www2.uic.edu/~dbrust2/ozone.html\">Ozone</a> is important because it shields us from damaging \n<a href=\"http://snoopy.gsfc.nasa.gov/~orfeus2/ultraviolet.html\">ultraviolet</a> sunlight.  Ozone is vulnerable, though, to \n<a href=\"http://www.ccinet.ab.ca/casa/cfchalon.htm\">CFCs and halons</a> being released into the atmosphere. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast161_8/notes31.html\">ozone hole's</a> large size is probably \nrelated to unusually low temperatures, \nallowing CFC byproducts like \n<a href=\"http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/17.html\">chlorine</a> to react with \n<a href=\"http://www.msc.cornell.edu/~plh2/group/glblwarm/GLBLWARM.HTM\">atmospheric</a> ozone molecules with greater efficiency.  \n\nIn the <a href=\"http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/~gshirah/toms/\">above false-color picture</a> taken earlier this month, low \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~eww6n/chem/Ozone.html\">ozone</a> levels are shown in blue.",
