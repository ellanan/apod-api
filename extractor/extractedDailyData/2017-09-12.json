  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow would you feel if the Sun disappeared?\n\nMany eclipse watchers \n<a href=\"ap160821.html\">across the USA</a> surprised themselves with the awe that they felt and the exclamations that they made as the Sun momentarily disappeared behind the Moon.\n\nPerhaps expecting just a brief moment of dusk, the spectacle of unusually rapid darkness, breathtakingly bright \n<a href=\"ap150328.html\">glowing beads</a> around the Moon's edge, \nshockingly pink \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/what-is-a-solar-prominence\">solar prominences</a>, and a strangely \n<a href=\"ap170813.html\">detailed corona</a> stretching across the sky \ncaught many a curmudgeon \n<a href=\"ap170908.html\">by</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.deepskycolors.com/archive/2017/08/30/My-2017-Total-Solar-Eclipse.html\">surprise</a>. \n\nMany of these attributes  \n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/232384839\">were captured</a> in the \n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/231484786\">featured real-time, three-minute video</a> \nof \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/\">last month's total solar eclipse</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzWc7adS-RY\">video frames</a> were acquired in \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_237pDMVHt8\">Warm Springs</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\">Oregon</a> \nwith equipment specifically designed by Jun Ho Oh to track a close-up of the Sun's periphery during eclipse.  \n\nAs the video ends, the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun\">Sun</a> \nis seen being reborn on the other side of the \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">Moon</a> from where it departed.",
