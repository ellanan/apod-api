  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn July of 1994 pieces of Comet\n<a href=\"http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/sl9.html\">Shoemaker-Levy 9\ncollided</a> with planet Jupiter.\n\nThe explosive impacts sent plumes of debris high into the Jovian\natmosphere creating\n<a href=\"ap950714.html\">dark markings or scars</a>, visible for a time\nagainst the cloud bands.\n\nRemarkably, 15 years later,\n<a href=\"http://jupiter.samba.org/\">another impact scar was\ndiscovered</a> in the Jovian atmosphere by amateur astronomer Anthony\nWesley as he examined images of the gas giant taken\nfrom his home observatory just outside Murrumbateman NSW Australia.\n\nJupiter's south pole is at the top in this July 19 discovery image,\nwith <a href=\"ap070312.html\">Jupiter rotating</a> from right to left.\n\nThe dark marking, also likely caused by a comet or asteroid impact,\nis near the top of the view, left of a pre-existing, whitish, oval-shaped\nstorm.\n\nNASA's <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/\njup-20090720.html\">Infrared Telescope Facility images</a> from Mauna\nKea, Hawaii later confirmed the likely\nimpact site's dark scar and plume of particles in Jupiter's upper\natmosphere.\n\nSince 2006, major discovery observations by amateur astronomers\nhave also included two <a href=\"ap080523.html\">red spots on Jupiter</a>.",
