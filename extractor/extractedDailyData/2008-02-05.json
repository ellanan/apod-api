  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHow has Comet Holmes changed?\n\nSince\n<a href=\"ap071026.html\">brightening unexpectedly</a> by nearly one\nmillion fold in late October, the last three months have found the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_%28cometary%29\">coma</a> of\n<a href=\"ap071110.html\">Comet 17P/Holmes</a> both expanding and fading.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pane/holmes/\">spectacular\ncomposite image</a> shows how the coma and tail of Comet\nHolmes have changed.\n\nDue to Earth's changing vantage point,\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/\ngallery_holmes_page27.htm\">Comet Holmes</a>,\nout beyond the\n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=17p&amp;orb=1\">orbit</a> of\nMars, was seen in November nearly head-on, but in recent months\nis seen more from the side.\n\nAdditionally,\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGl-TZxGJUQ\">the comet</a>'s\nmotion,\nwhen combined with Earth's changing perspective, has caused the comet to\nhave shifted relative to the background stars.\n\nThe curved path of\n<a href=\"ap071205.html\">Comet Holmes</a> shows it to be undergoing\napparent\n<a href=\"ap031216.html\">retrograde motion</a> as the Earth orbits\nquickly in front of it.\n\nThe extent of the coma currently makes\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Holmes\">Comet Holmes</a>\nover five times the physical size of our Sun.\n\nAnecdotal evidence holds that the\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/icq/CometMags.html#0017P\">comet</a> is hard to see without long photographic exposures,\nbut on such exposures the comet may still be an\n<a href=\"ap051224.html\">impressive sight</a>.",
