  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\n\nAs the Earth spins on its axis,\n<a href=\"http://www.lochness.com/tcapage.html\">the sky seems to rotate around us</a>.  This\nmotion produces the beautiful concentric arcs traced out by the stars in this\ntime exposure of the night sky.\n\nIn the middle of the picture is the\n<a href=\"http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/astro/CS/CS.03.html\">North Celestial Pole (NCP)</a>, easily identified as\n<a href=\"http://lsnt7.lightspeed.net/astronomy/naked-eye/naked-eye.html#A1.2.1\">the point in the sky</a>\nat the center of all the star trail arcs.\n\nThe very short bright trail near the NCP was made by the\n<a href=\"http://www.arcorp.com/polaris.html\">star Polaris</a>, commonly\nknown as\n<a href=\"http://www.indians.org/welker/northsta.htm\">the North Star</a>.",
