  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNeptune has never looked so clear in \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">infrared</a> light. \n\nNeptune is the eighth most distant planet from the Sun, \nthirty times the Earth-Sun distance.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html\">Neptune</a> is the fourth largest planet, \nalmost four times Earth's diameter.  \n\nSurprisingly, <a href=\"ap991005.html\">Neptune</a> \nradiates about twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun.  \n\nA fascinating feature of the <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Oct99/Hayward.Palomar.deb.html\">above photograph</a> is that it was taken far from distant \n<a href=\"ap960508.html\">Neptune</a>, \nthrough the Earth's normally blurry atmosphere.  \n\nThe great clarity of this recently released image was made \npossible by \"rubber mirror\" \n<a href=\"http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu/public/adaptive.html\">adaptive optics</a> technology.  \n\nHere, mirrors in the new \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.cornell.edu/PHARO/pharo.html\">Palomar High Angular Resolution Observer</a> \n(PHARO) instrument connected to the \n<a href=\"http://astro.caltech.edu/palomarpublic/info/brochure.html\">200-inch Hale Telescope</a> \nflex to remove the effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere.",
