  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes even the dark dust of interstellar space has a serene beauty.\n\nOne such place occurs toward the constellation of Taurus. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/321989/B/\">filaments featured here</a> can be found on the \n<a href=\"ap150128.html\">sky between</a> the \n<a href=\"ap150617.html\">Pleiades star cluster</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap160112.html\">California Nebula</a>.\n\nThis dust is not known not for its bright glow but for its absorption and opaqueness.\n\nSeveral bright stars are visible with their blue light seen \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_701.html\">reflecting</a> off the brown dust. \n\nOther <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">stars</a> appear unusually red as their light barely peeks through a column of dark dust, \nwith red the color that remains after the \n<a href=\"http://scijinks.jpl.nasa.gov/blue-sky/\">blue is scattered</a> away.\n\nYet other stars are behind <a href=\"ap120722.html\">dust pillars</a> so thick they are not visible here. \n\nAlthough <a href=\"https://www.globalanimal.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Home-alone-dog-destroys-toilet-paper.jpg\">appearing serene</a>, the scene is actually an ongoing loop of tumult and rebirth.\n\nThis is because massive enough knots of gas and dust will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbdwTwB8jtc\">gravitationally collapse</a> \nto form new stars -- stars that both \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust#Dust_grain_formation\">create new dust</a> \nin their atmospheres and destroy old dust with their energetic light and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\">winds</a>.",
