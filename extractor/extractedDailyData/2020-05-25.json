  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nInside the head of this interstellar monster is a star that is slowly destroying it. \n\nThe huge monster, actually an inanimate series of pillars of gas and dust, measures \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> in length. \n\nThe in-head star is not itself visible through the \n<a href=\"ap171008.html\">opaque</a>  \n<a href=\"http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html#dust\">interstellar dust</a> \nbut is bursting out partly by ejecting opposing beams of energetic particles called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object\">Herbig-Haro</a> jets. \n\nLocated about 7,500 light years away in the \n<a href=\"ap190623.html\">Carina Nebula</a> and known informally as \nMystic Mountain, the appearance of these pillars \nis dominated by dark dust even though they are composed mostly of clear \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\">hydrogen</a> gas. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/49452041152/in/faves-53460575@N03/\">featured image</a> was taken with the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nAll over these pillars, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">energetic light</a> and \n<a href=\"ap200121.html\">winds</a> from massive newly formed stars are \nevaporating and dispersing the dusty stellar nurseries in which they formed. \n\nWithin a few million years, the head of this giant, as well as most of its body, will have been \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvrAFFVVE9E\">completely evaporated</a> by internal and surrounding stars.",
