  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nKnown to some in the northern hemisphere as\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/\">December's</a>\nCold Moon or\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/december-full-moon-mimics-the-june-sun/\">the Long Night Moon</a>,\nthe last full moon of 2023 is rising in this surreal mountain and skyscape.\n\nThe Daliesque scene was captured in a single exposure with a camera and\nlong telephoto lens near Monte Grappa, Italy.\n\nThe full moon is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory\">not melting, though</a>.\n\nIts stretched and distorted appearance near the\nhorizon is caused as refraction along the line of sight\nchanges and creates shifting images or\n<a href=\"https://atoptics.co.uk/blog/full-moon-mirage/\">mirages of the bright lunar disk</a>.\n\nThe changes in atmospheric refraction correspond to\n<a href=\"ap170120.html\">atmospheric layers</a>\nwith sharply different temperatures and\ndensities.\n\nOther effects of atmospheric refraction produced by the long sight-line\nto this full moon rising include the thin red rim \nseen faintly on the distorted lower edge of the Moon\nand a thin\n<a href=\"ap220715.html\">green rim</a> along the top.",
