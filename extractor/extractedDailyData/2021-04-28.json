  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is Polaris called the North Star?\n\nFirst, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris\">Polaris</a> is the nearest \n<a href=\"ap190625.html\">bright star</a> toward the north \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#/media/File:AxialTiltObliquity.png\">spin axis</a> of the Earth. \n\nTherefore, as the Earth turns, stars appear to revolve around Polaris, \nbut Polaris itself always stays in the same northerly direction -- making it the \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star\">North Star</a>. \n\nSince no bright star is near the \n<a href=\"ap210101.html\">south spin axis</a> of the Earth, there is currently \n<a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/our-solar-system/81-the-universe/stars-and-star-clusters/stargazing/374-is-there-a-south-star-intermediate\">no South Star</a>. \n\nThousands of years ago, Earth's spin axis pointed in a slightly different direction so that \n<a href=\"https://www.space.com/21719-vega.html\">Vega was the North Star</a>. \n\nAlthough <a href=\"ap150602.html\">Polaris</a> is not the brightest star on the sky, \nit is easily located because it is \n<a href=\"ap201116.html\">nearly aligned with two stars</a> in the cup of the \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/big-and-little-dippers-highlight-northern-sky\">Big Dipper</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Ursa_Minor_IAU.svg\">Polaris</a> is near the center of the eight-degree wide \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNkySjvHTjx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">featured image</a>, an image that has been \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/9c/3e/079c3ea0dce59cc171629800294b0f3d.jpg\">digitally manipulated</a> to suppress surrounding dim stars \nbut accentuate the faint gas and dust of the \n<a href=\"ap170627.html\">Integrated Flux Nebula</a> (IFN). \n\nThe surface of \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html\">Cepheid</a> Polaris slowly \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/7ohkKiZTJOg\">pulsates</a>, \ncausing the star to \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/q-szkabhXQQ\">change its brightness</a> \nby a few percent over the course of a few days.",
