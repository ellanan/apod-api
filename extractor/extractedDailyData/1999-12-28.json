  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFittingly, 1999 saw a decade of astronomical\n<a href=\"ap970513.html\">discoveries</a>\nto an end with portents of things to come - embodied in\nnew spacecraft, telescopes, and perspectives to explore the\ndistant Universe across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nX-ray astronomy in particular will likely flourish in coming years,\njudging from this year's successful launch of the\ntriple-barrelled\n<a href=\"ap991221.html\">X-ray Multi-Mirror satellite</a> and\nspectacular first results from the orbiting\n<a href=\"ap990827.html\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>.\n\nGround-based astronomy will flourished too as\n<a href=\"ap990309.html\">very large telescopes</a> and\n<a href=\"ap990121.html\">new instruments</a> have come\nonline or near completion.\n\nRadio astronomers also achieved an observational\nmilestone this year with the\n<a href=\"ap991216.html\">record breaking VLBI observations</a>\nfrom a network of radio telescopes\nas large as planet Earth.\n\nBut the APOD editors' favorite astronomical screensaver\nof 1999 has leveraged\nthe phenomenonal growth of the internet and the\npersonal computer boom to support the Search\nfor ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence in\n<a href=\"ap990517.html\">the SETI@home project</a> -\nwhich has now likely involved more computer power than any\nother project in history.",
