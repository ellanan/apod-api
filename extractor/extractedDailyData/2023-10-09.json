  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but have you ever seen a sunrise like this? \n\nHere, after initial cloudiness, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">the Sun</a> \nappeared to rise in two pieces and during a partial eclipse in 2019, \ncausing the photographer to describe it as the most stunning sunrise of his life. \n\nThe dark circle near the top of the \n<a href=\"https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/about/redsky/\">atmospherically-reddened Sun</a> is \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">the Moon</a> -- \nbut so is the dark peak just below it. \n\nThis is because along the way, the \n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> had a \nlayer of unusually warm air over the sea which acted like a \n<a href=\"ap211228.html\">gigantic lens</a> and created a \n<a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6469/files/twincats.png\">second image</a>. \n\nFor a normal sunrise or sunset, this rare phenomenon of \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/\">atmospheric optics</a> \nis known as the <a href=\"ap090223.html\">Etruscan vase effect</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B68KArFlUnr/\">featured picture</a> was \n<a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/sunrise-red-horns-solar-eclipse-elias-chasiotis/\">captured</a> in December 2019 from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wakrah\">Al Wakrah</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar\">Qatar</a>. \n\nSome observers in a narrow band of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts\">Earth</a> \nto the east were able to see a \n<a href=\"ap120519.html\">full annular solar eclipse</a> -- \nwhere the Moon appears completely surrounded by the background Sun in a \n<a href=\"ap230910.html\">ring of fire</a>. \n\nThe next solar eclipse, also an annular eclipse for well-placed observers, \nwill \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when/\">occur this coming Saturday</a>.",
