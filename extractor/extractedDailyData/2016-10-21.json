  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn October 15, standing near the summit of Hawaii's\n<a href=\"ap160225.html\">Mauna Kea</a>\nand looking away from a gorgeous sunset produced this\nmagnificent snapshot of a Full Moon rising within\nthe volcanic mountain's shadow.\n\nAn alignment across the\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/\">Solar System</a> is captured in the\nstunning scene and seeming contradiction of bright Moon in dark shadow.\n\nThe triangular appearance of a\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/mshadims.htm\">shadow cast</a>\nby a mountain's irregular profile is normal.\n\nIt's created by the perspective\nof the distant mountaintop view through the dense atmosphere.\n\nRising as the Sun sets, the antisolar point or\nthe point opposite the Sun is close to the perspective's vanishing\npoint near the mountain shadow's peak.\n\nBut extending in the antisolar direction, Earth's conical shadow is\nonly <a href=\"ap111215.html\">a few lunar diameters</a>\nwide at the distance of the Moon.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/\neverything-you-need-to-know-hunters-moon\">So October's</a>\nFull Hunters Moon is still reflecting sunlight,\nseen through the mountain's atmospheric shadow but\nfound too far from the antisolar point and the Earth's extended shadow\n<a href=\"ap080301.html\">to be eclipsed.</a>",
