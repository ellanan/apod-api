  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill the sky be clear enough to see the eclipse?\n\nThis question is already on the minds of many North Americans hoping to see \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/\">tomorrow's solar eclipse</a>. \n\nThis question was also on the mind of many people attempting to see the total solar eclipse that crossed North America in \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2017/TSE2017.html\">August 2017</a>. \n\nThen, the path of total darkness shot across the mainland of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wxiMrvDbq3s\">coast to coast</a>, from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\">Oregon</a> to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina\">South Carolina</a> -- but, like tomorrow's event, a partial eclipse occurred above most of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a>. \n\nUnfortunately, in 2017, many locations <a href=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/2djrn56blv6r/7rAzwZd1uxcIsKO7ZfJqVL/686320c46e6ff8d63191f3a8eb33de1f/sad-cat-header.jpg\">saw predominantly clouds</a>.\n\nOne location that did not was a bank of the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/DQoMKHMev6o\">Green River Lakes</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming\">Wyoming</a>. \n\nIntermittent clouds were far enough away to allow the center image of the \n<a href=\"https://www.launchphotography.com/Total_Solar_Eclipse_2017.html\">featured composite sequence</a> to be taken, \nan image that shows the \n<a href=\"ap240402.html\">corona</a> of the Sun extending out past the central dark \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a> that blocks \n<a href=\"https://solar-center.stanford.edu/interview/nemiroff.html\">our familiar Sun</a>.\n\nThe surrounding images show the \n<a href=\"ap180211.html\">partial phase</a>s of the solar eclipse both before and after totality.",
