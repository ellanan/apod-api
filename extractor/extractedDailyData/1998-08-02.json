  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes you can't see the forest for the\ntrees.  But if you look closely at the center of the <a href=\"http://icarus.stsci.edu/~ferguson/research/dogs/dogsrgb2cap.html\">above photograph</a>,\nyou will see a whole <a href=\"ap950912.html\">spiral galaxy</a>\nbehind the field of stars. Named <a href=\"http://icarus.stsci.edu/~ferguson/research/dogs/dogs.html\">Dwingeloo 1</a>,\nthis nearby galaxy was only discovered recently (1994) because\nmuch of its light was obscured by <a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a>,\n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">gas</a> and <a href=\"ap960925.html\">bright stars</a>\nof our own <a href=\"lib/milky_way.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\nIn fact, all the individually discernible stars in the above photograph\nare in <a href=\"ap960213.html\">our Galaxy</a>. Dwingeloo\n1 turned out to be a large galaxy located only five times as distant\nas the closest major galaxy - <a href=\"ap961009.html\">M31</a>.",
