  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan a gas cloud eat a galaxy?  \n\nIt's not even close.  \n\nThe odd looking \"creature\" or \"hand\" extending down from the top of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomie.be/hambsch/namibia07/p21338_50f3.htm\">above photo</a> is a gas cloud known as a \n<a href=\"http://www.public.iastate.edu/~sdk/fick/april.html\">cometary globule</a>. \n\nThis globule, however, has ruptured. \n\nCometary <a href=\"ap020325.html\">globules</a> \nare typically characterized by \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dusty</a> heads and\nelongated <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...463L.105M\">tails</a>. \n\nThese features cause cometary \n<a href=\"ap020108.html\">globules</a> \nto have visual similarities to comets, \nbut in reality they are very much different. \n\n<a href=\"ap041020.html\">Globules</a> \nare frequently the birthplaces of stars, \nand many show very young stars in their heads.\n\nThe reason for the rupture in the head of this \nobject is not completely known. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy\">galaxy</a> \nto the near the bottom of the image is huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995A%26A...293..493G\">CG4</a> by chance superposition.",
