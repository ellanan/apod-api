  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs the Sun always straight up at noontime?\n\nNo.\n\nFor example, the Sun <i> never </i> appears directly overhead from\nlocations\nwell north or south of the Earth's equator.\n\nConversely, there is <i> always </i> a place on Earth where the Sun will\nappear at zenith at noon -- for example on the equator during an \n<a href=\"ap130922.html\">equinox</a>.\n\nTurning the problem around, however, as in finding where the Sun\nactually appears to be at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon\">high noon</a>, \nis as easy as waiting for midday, pointing your camera up, and taking a\npicture.\n\nIf you do this <a href=\"http://www.analemma.com/\">often enough</a>, \nyou find that as the days march by, the Sun slowly traces out a figure\neight on the sky.\n\n<a href=\"\nhttp://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3004095\">Pictured\nabove</a> \nis one such high noon \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma\">analemma</a> -- \na series of pictures always taken at exactly noontime over the course of\na year.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/04/29/analemma_the_position_of_the_sun_in_the_sky_changing_over_a_year.html\">above fisheye image</a>, accumulated mostly during 2012,\nalso shows some buildings and trees of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku\">Baku</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan\">Azerbaijan</a> around\nthe edges.",
