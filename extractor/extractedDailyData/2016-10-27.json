  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nVery faint but also very large on planet Earth's sky, a\ngiant Squid Nebula cataloged as Ou4, and Sh2-129 also known as the\nFlying Bat Nebula, are both caught in this cosmic scene\ntoward the royal constellation Cepheus.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stern-fan.de/Seiten/galerie-das-Neueste.html\">Composed\nwith almost</a> 17 hours of narrowband image data,\nthe telescopic field of view is 4 degrees or 8 Full Moons across.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2477\">Discovered in 2011 by</a>\nFrench astro-imager <a href=\"http://www.outters.fr/pn.html\">Nicolas\nOutters</a>, the Squid Nebula's alluring\n<a href=\"ap130915.html\">bipolar shape</a> is distinguished here\nby the telltale blue-green\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium\">emission from</a>\ndoubly ionized oxygen atoms.\n\nThough apparently completely surrounded by the reddish hydrogen\nemission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature\nof the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine.\n\nStill, a <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4617\">recent\ninvestigation</a> suggests Ou4 really does lie\n<a href=\"http://www.astroanarchy.blogspot.fi/2013/12/\na-start-of-new-project-cepheus-mosaic.html\">within Sh2-129</a>\nsome 2,300 light-years away.\n\nConsistent with that scenario, Ou4 would represent a spectacular\noutflow driven by HR8119, a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/\nnewly-discovered-planet-has-3-suns\">triple</a>\nsystem of hot, massive stars seen near the center of the nebula.\n\nThe truly giant <a href=\"ap140718.html\">Squid Nebula</a>\nwould physically be nearly 50 light-years across.",
