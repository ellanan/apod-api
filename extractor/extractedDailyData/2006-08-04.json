  "explanation": "Get out your red/blue glasses and gaze across Burns Cliff along the inner wall of Endurance crater on Mars! The view from the perspective of Mars rover Opportunity is a color anaglyph - two different images are presented to the left and right eyes by color filters to produce the 3D effect. Scroll the picture to the right to see the full 180 degree panorama. Still returning science data and images, both Spirit and Opportunity rovers completed 2 years of Mars exploration in January. Opportunity spent the month of July on the road to Victoria crater. The stereo pair of images used to create this view are based on image data recorded in November 2004.",
