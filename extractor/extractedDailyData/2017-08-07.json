  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMost galaxies don't have any rings -- why does this galaxy have two? \n\nTo begin, the bright band near \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1512\">NGC 1512</a>'s center is a \n<a href=\"ap170710.html\">nuclear ring</a>, \na ring that surrounds the galaxy center and glows brightly with recently \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation\">formed stars</a>.\n\nMost stars and accompanying gas and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a>, \nhowever, orbit the galactic center in a ring much further out -- \nhere seen near the image edge.\n\nThis ring is called, \n<a href=\"http://www.guy-sports.com/fun_pictures/cat_curious_wall.jpg\">counter-intuitively</a>, the inner ring. \n\nIf you look closely, you will see this \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJS..230...14M&quot;\">the inner ring connects</a> ends of a diffuse \n<a href=\"ap160109.html\">central bar</a> \nthat runs horizontally across the galaxy.\n\nThese ring structures are thought to be caused by \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1712/\">NGC 1512</a>'s \nown asymmetries in a drawn-out process called \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ARA%26A..42..603K\">secular evolution</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap150112.html\">gravity</a> of these galaxy asymmetries, \nincluding the bar of stars, \ncause gas and dust to fall from the inner ring to the nuclear ring, \nenhancing this ring's rate of \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/universe_level2/stars.html\">star</a> formation. \n\n<a href=\"ap150526.html\">Some spiral galaxies</a> \nalso have a third ring -- an outer ring that \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-orbit-58.html\">circles</a> the galaxy even further out.",
