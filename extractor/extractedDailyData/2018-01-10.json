  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere do stars form when galaxies collide?\n\nTo help find out, astronomers imaged the nearby galaxy merger\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1742a/\">NGC 2623</a> in high resolution with the\n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nAnalysis of this and other Hubble images as well as images of\n<a href=\"http://server1.sky-map.org/starview?object_type=2&amp;object_id=1856\">NGC 2623</a> in\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared light</a> by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>, in\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">X-ray light</a> by\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMM-Newton\">XMM-Newton</a>, and in\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> by\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GALEX\">GALEX</a>,\nindicate that two originally\n<a href=\"ap080721.html\">spiral galaxies</a> appear now to be\ngreatly convolved and that their cores have unified into one\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus\">active galactic nucleus</a> (AGN).\n\nStar formation continues around this core near the\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1742a/\">featured image</a> center, along the stretched out\n<a href=\"ap060108.html\">tidal tail</a>s visible on either side,\nand perhaps surprisingly, in an off-nuclear region on the upper left where\n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">clusters</a> of bright blue stars appear.    \n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-0GaBQ494E\">Galaxy collisions</a> can take hundreds of millions of years and take several gravitationally destructive passes.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFyZMJ1viIY\">NGC 2623</a>, \nalso known as \n<a href=\"ap121019.html\">Arp 243</a>, \nspans about 50,000 light years and lies about \n250 million light years away toward the constellation of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(constellation)\">the Crab (Cancer)</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...606A..95C\">Reconstructing</a> the original galaxies and how\n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">galaxy mergers</a> happen is often challenging,\nsometimes impossible, but generally important to understanding\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution\">how our universe evolved</a>.",
