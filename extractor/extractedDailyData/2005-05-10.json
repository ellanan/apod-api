  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt's the faint red object, not the bright white one \nthat might be a historic find. \n\nThe white object is surely a \n<a href=\"http://astron.berkeley.edu/~stars/bdwarfs/\">brown dwarf star</a>.  \n\nQuite possibly, however, the red object is the \nfirst direct image of a \n<a href=\"http://exoplanets.org/\">planet beyond</a> our \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nThe intriguing possibility was first reported last year, \nbut many astronomers weren't then convinced that the \n\"planet\" was not just a background star.   \n\nEarlier this year, the \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planet_photo_040910.html\">2M1207 star system</a> was imaged twice more \nin an effort to resolve the issue.  \n\nTo the delight of the <a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504659\">scientific team</a>, the objects kept the same separation, \nindicating that they are \n<a href=\"http://www.edu-observatory.org/eo/binary_stars.html\">gravitationally bound</a>.  \n\nThe faint red object 2M1207b is therefore 100 times fainter, \nintrinsically, than the bright white brown dwarf 2M1207a -- a \ncharacteristic well explained by a planet roughly \nfive times the mass of \n<a href=\"jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504659\">discovery</a> - \nstill subject to further confirmation - is considered \na step toward the more ambitious goal of imaging \n<a href=\"http://origins.stsci.edu/under/planets.shtml\">Earth-like planets</a> orbiting distant stars.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2005/pr-12-05-p2.html\">above image</a> was taken with the high-resolution adaptive-optic \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/instruments/naco/\">NaCo</a> \ncamera attached to the 8-meter \n<a href=\"ap000707.html\">Very Large Telescope</a> Yepun in <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ci.html\">Chile</a>.",
