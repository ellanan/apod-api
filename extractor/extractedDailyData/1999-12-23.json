  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOn May 10, for some unknown reason, the \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">Solar Wind</a> virtually stopped.\n\nNormally our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> emits a \n<a href=\"ap970217.html\">wind</a> of between \nfive and ten energetic particles per cubic centimeter \nmoving outward at about 500 kilometers per second.  \n\nLate on May 10, however, this \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/9912/prsample.html\">gale was reduced</a> to a mere breeze of one \nparticle per every five cubic centimeters.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"ap990915.html\">Sun's Corona</a> \nwas suddenly able to flow out into the \n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/solar/solar.html\">Solar System</a> relatively unimpeded, \ncreating beams of energetic \n<a href=\"http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/on-line/electron/section2/discovery.html\">electrons</a>.  \n\nOne such beam apparently reached \n<a href=\"ap991019.html\">Earth's North Magnetic Pole</a>, \nand was seen as the unusual X-ray aurora digitally reconstructed in the \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/9912/immovies.html\">above false-color image</a>.  \n\nOur atmosphere absorbed the electrons. \n\nThis display gave direct evidence, however, that \n<a href=\"http://www.geolab.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/e_nmpole.html\">Earth's North Magnetic Pole</a> was connected to the Sun, \nwhile the Earth's South Magnetic Pole \n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/sechtml/tut.html\">connected</a> to the distant Solar System.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap990208.html\">Solar Wind</a> returned \nto normal on May 12.",
