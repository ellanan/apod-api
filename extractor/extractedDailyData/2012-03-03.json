  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nRemarkable comet Garradd (C2009/P1) has come to be known for two\ndistinctive tails.\n\nFrom the perspective of earthbound comet watchers the tails are\nvisible <a href=\"ap120228.html\">on opposite sides of its greenish coma</a>.\n\nSeen here in a telescopic view, the\nrecognizable dust tail fans out to the right, trailing the comet nucleus\nin its orbit.\n\nStreaming away from the sunward direction,\na familiar bluish ion tail sweeps to the left.\n\nBut the comet also seems to have, at least temporarily,\nsprouted a second ion tail recorded in\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosandille.fr/Garradd.html\">this\nimage from February 24</a>.\n\nOther comet imagers have\n<a href=\"http://www.astrostudio.at/2_Bright%20Comets.php\">recently\ncaptured</a> changing\n<a href=\"http://www.ruppel.darkhorizons.org/index.htm\">structures\nin Garradd's</a>\nion tail created as the plasma is\n<a href=\"ap090207.html\">buffeted by</a> the\nmagnetic fields in the solar wind.\n\n<a href=\"http://cometchasing.skyhound.com/\">Now moving more quickly</a>\nthrough northern skies,\non March 5th comet Garradd will reach its closest approach to\nplanet Earth, about 10.5 light-minutes distant.",
