  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's the world's most complex space robot doing up there?  \n\nLast week, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextre\">Dextre</a> was imaged moving atop the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_laboratory\">Destiny Laboratory</a> \nModule of the \n<a href=\"ap080305.html\">International Space Station (ISS)</a>, \ncompleting tasks prior to the deployment of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Experiment_Module\">Kibo</a> pressurized science laboratory.\n\nDextre, short for the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canad</a>i<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">a</a>n-built \n<a href=\"http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2008/03/10/dextre_robot/\">Special Purpose Dextrous Manipulator</a>, \nhas arms three meters in length and can attach power tools as fingers.  \n\nBehind <a href=\"ap080401.html\">Dextre</a> is the \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html#stars\">blackness of space</a>, \nwhile Earth looms over Dextre's head.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/theme/jpm02/\">Kibo</a> laboratory segment being deployed during space shuttle Discovery's trip to the ISS can be pressurized and contains racks of scientific experiment that will be used to explore many things, including \n<a href=\"http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/theme/jpm02/Hoson_E.pdf\">how plants brace themselves against gravity</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/theme/jpm02/Furukawa_E.pdf\">how \nwater might be inhibited from freezing</a> in cells under microgravity.",
