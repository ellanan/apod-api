  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nRanging throughout the\n<a href=\"http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/\">solar system</a>, these pictures all\nhave something in common.\n\nThey were taken with an 8 inch diameter telescope, a size popular\nwith amateur astronomy buffs, and slightly modified \"web cam\"\nof the type widely used to send images out over the internet.\n\nThe results are clearly\n<a href=\"http://www.djcash.demon.co.uk/astro/webcam/webcam.htm\">remarkable\nfor</a> such inexpensive and readily available equipment.\n\nEach sharp image was produced from 20 to 30 frames which\nwere digitally stacked and processed using\n<a href=\"http://utopia.ision.nl/users/rjstek/english/software/\nindex.htm\">free software</a>.\n\nUntil recently, digital imaging for amateur astronomers required a\n<a href=\"http://www.wvi.com/~rberry/cookbook.htm\">specialized camera</a>,\nbut the advent of low-light\nvideo surveillance cameras and web cams now presents other\noptions for\n<a href=\"http://www.astrabio.demon.co.uk/QCUIAG/ac/3dmoon.htm\">relatively\nbright</a> solar system objects.\n\nWant to try some\n<a href=\"http://www.astrabio.demon.co.uk/QCUIAG/\">unconventional</a>\nweb cam astronomy?\n\nGeoff Chester, Public Affairs Officer at the\n<a href=\"http://www.usno.navy.mil\">U.S. Naval Observatory</a>,\noffers these images and an\n<a href=\"http://www.usno.navy.mil/pao/QuickCamAstro.shtml\">account\nof his own adventures</a>\nfrom a suburban front lawn near Washington D.C.",
