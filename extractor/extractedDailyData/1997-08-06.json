  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nGood <a href=\"http://www.chimacum.wednet.edu/highschool/jeff/Photo/camera/camera3.html\">cameras</a> were able to obtain impressive photographs of\n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> \nwhen at its brightest earlier this year.  In the \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/comet/pach9.html\">above \nphotograph</a> taken April 5th, Comet Hale-Bopp was imaged from the \nIndian Cove Campground in the \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/jotr/\">Joshua Tree National Forest</a> in California, USA.  \nA flashlight was used to momentarily illuminate foreground rocks in this 30 second exposure.  <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/info-events/hale-bopp/comet-hale-bopp-summary-aug01-97-rw.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp is still visible</a> to the unaided eye in \n<a href=\"ap951222.html\">Earth's Southern Hemisphere</a>, \nwith observers there reporting it to be about 4th \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a>.  The comet is now passing nearly in front of the star \n<a href=\"ap960902.html\">Sirius</a>, and shows only a slight \n<a href=\"ap970403.html\">dust tail</a>.",
