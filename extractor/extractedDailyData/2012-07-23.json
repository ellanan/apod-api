  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow fast is lightning?\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning\">Lightning</a>, in fact, moves not only too fast for humans to see, but so fast that humans can't even tell which direction it is moving.\n\nThe above \n<a href=\"ap100720.html\">lightning</a> stroke did not move too fast, however, for \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/28457062\">this extremely high time resolution video</a> to resolve.\n\nTracking at an incredible 7,207 frames per second, actual time can be seen progressing at the video bottom.\n\nThe above <a href=\"ap100419.html\">lightning</a> bolt starts with many simultaneously creating ionized channels branching out from an negatively charged pool of \n<a href=\"https://www.aip.org/history/electron/\">electrons</a> and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion\">ions</a> that has somehow been created by \ndrafts and collisions in a \n<a href=\"ap101130.html\">rain cloud</a>.\n\nAbout 0.015 seconds after appearing -- which takes about 3 seconds in the above time-lapse video -- \none of the meandering charge leaders <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn65RFvJKnk\">makes contact</a> \nwith a suddenly appearing positive spike moving up from the ground and an ionized channel of air is created that instantly acts like a wire.\n\nImmediately afterwards, this hot channel pulses with a tremendous amount of charges shooting back and forth between the cloud and the ground, creating a \n<a href=\"http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/emergency/weather/lightning/\">dangerous</a> \nexplosion that is later \n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Thunder.ogg\">heard as thunder</a>.\n\nMuch remains unknown about \n<a href=\"http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/faq/faq_ltg.php/\">lightning</a>, \nhowever, including details of the \n<a href=\"http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/index.html?quid=281\">mechanism</a> \nthat separates charges.",
