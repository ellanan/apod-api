  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSeeing mountain peaks glow red from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlpzAvQ8t8s\">inside the Grand Canyon</a> was one of the \nmost incredible sunset experiences of this amateur photographer's life.\n\nThey appeared even more incredible later, when digitally combined with an \n<a href=\"ap170522.html\">exposure of the night sky</a> -- \ntaken by the same camera and from the same location -- an hour later. \n\nThe two images were taken last August from the 220 Mile Canyon campsite on the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAfa8LKRVx8\">Colorado River</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona\">Arizona</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.\n\nThe peaks glow red because they were lit by an \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">unusually red sunset</a>. \n\nLater, high above, the band of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> angled dramatically down, \nfilled with stars, nebula, and dark clouds of dust.\n\nTo the Milky Way's left is the planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>, while to the right is the brighter \n<a href=\"ap200129.html\">Jupiter</a>. \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"ap190908.html\">Jupiter</a> and \n<a href=\"ap170829.html\">Saturn</a> are now hard to see, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">Venus</a> will be \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/whats-up-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/\">visible</a> and quite bright to the west in clear skies, \njust after sunset, for the next two months.",
