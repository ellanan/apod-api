  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan the night sky appear both serene and surreal?\n\nPerhaps classifiable as serene in the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/matipon.tangmatitham/posts/10101461491920275?stream_ref=10\">above panoramic image</a> taken \nlast Friday are the faint lights of small towns glowing\nacross a dark foreground landscape of \n<a href=\"http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=1&amp;lg=2\">Doi Inthanon National Park</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand\">Thailand</a>, as well as the \nnumerous stars glowing across a dark background starscape.\n\nAlso visible are the planet Venus and a band of \n<a href=\"ap120116.html\">zodiacal light</a> on the image left. \n\nUnusual events are also captured, however.\n\nFirst, the \n<a href=\"ap990224.html\">central band</a> of our \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, while usually a\ncommon sight, appears here to hover \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism\">surreally</a> \nabove the ground.\n\nNext, a fortuitous streak of a meteor was captured on the image right.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual component is the bright spot just to the left of the meteor.\n\nThat spot is the plume of a rising Ariane 5 rocket, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/ariane-5-eca-launches-abs-2-athena-fidus/\">launched</a> a few minutes before from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourou\">Kourou</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana\">French Guiana</a>.\n\nHow lucky was the astrophotographer to capture the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSXEwTzP3ig\">rocket launch</a> in his image?\n\nPretty lucky -- the image was not\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Persistence_of_Memory.jpg\">timed</a> to \n<a href=\"ap111127.html\">capture the rocket</a>.\n\nAlso lucky was how photogenic -- and perhaps \n<a href=\"http://funny-pics.co/wp-content/uploads/funny-cat-in-the-fence-picture.jpg\">surreal</a> -- the rest of the sky turned out to be.",
