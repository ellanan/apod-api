  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy are parts of this asteroid's surface so smooth?  \n\nNo one is yet sure, but it may have to do with the dynamics of an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid\">asteroid</a> that is a loose \n\n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/rubble-pile_asteroid.html\">pile of rubble</a> rather than a solid rock.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap051116.html\">unusual asteroid</a> \nhas been visited recently by the \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html\">Japan</a>ese spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa\">Hayabusa</a> \nthat has been documenting its unusual structure and mysterious \n<a href=\"ap051121.html\">lack of craters</a>.  \n\nRecent <a href=\"http://www.psi.edu/press/\">analyses of the border regions</a> \nbetween smooth and rugged sections of Itokawa indicate that jostling of the asteroid might be creating segregation between large and small rocks near the surface, like the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_nut_effect\">Brazil nut effect</a>.\n\nIn late 2005, Hayabusa actually <a href=\"\nhttp://www.planetary.org/news/2005/1126_Hayabusa_Spacecraft_Lands_on_Asteroid.html\">touched down</a> on one of the smooth patches, dubbed the MUSES Sea, and \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/1128_Hayabusa_Got_Sample_Yes.html\">collected soil samples</a> that are to be returned to Earth for analysis.\n\nHayabusa will start its three-year long \n<a href=\"http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/snews/2007/0406.shtml\">return trip</a> \nto Earth this month.\n\nComputer simulations show that 500-meter asteroid Itokawa \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005Icar..179..291M\">may impact the Earth</a> within the next few million years.",
