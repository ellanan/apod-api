  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to fly over the North Pole of Jupiter?\n\nA <a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/juno-provides-infared-tour-of-north-pole\">fictional animation</a> made from real images and data captured by NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/juno-solar-power-infographic.jpg\">Juno spacecraft</a> shows an answer.\n\nSince the pole is presently in shadow, the video uses \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> \nlight emitted by \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> -- specifically an \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2018/0411-diving-into-juno-jiram-data.html\">infrared color</a> where the hottest features glows the brightest. \n\nAs \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By6sZ6RGCEQ\">the animation</a> starts, Juno zooms in on the enormous world. \n\nSoon, one of the \n<a href=\"ap180308.html\">eight cyclones</a> orbiting the North Pole is featured. \n\nOne by one, all eight cyclones circling the pole are inspected, \neach the size of an entire continent on \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>, and each containing bumpy and fragmented spiral walls.  \n\nThe virtual trip ends with a zoom out. \n\nStudying Jovian cyclones helps humanity to \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html\">better understand</a> dangerous \n<a href=\"ap171127.html\">storm systems</a> that occur here on Earth.  \n\nJuno has recently concluded another \n<a href=\"ap180226.html\">close pass</a> by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter\">Jupiter</a> -- \n<a href=\"ap170603.html\">Perijove</a> 12 -- \nand seems healthy enough to complete several more of the two-month orbits.",
