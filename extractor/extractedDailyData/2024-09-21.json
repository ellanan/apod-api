  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-september-equinox/\">The defining astronomical moment</a>\nof this September's equinox is at 12:44 UTC on September 22,\nwhen the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving south in its\n<a href=\"ap220918.html\">yearly journey</a> through planet Earth's sky.\n\nThat marks the beginning of\n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/autumnal-equinox.html\">fall for our fair planet</a>\nin the northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere,\nwhen day and night are nearly equal around the globe. \n\nOf course, if you celebrate the\nastronomical change of seasons\nby watching a sunrise you can also\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/76261/crepuscular-rays-india\">look for crepuscular rays</a>.\n\nOutlined by shadows cast by clouds, crepuscular rays\ncan have a dramatic appearance in the\ntwilight sky during any sunrise (or sunset).\n\nDue to perspective, the parallel cloud shadows will seem to\npoint back to the rising Sun\n<a href=\"ap160922.html\">and a place</a>\ndue east on your horizon on the equinox date.\n\nBut in this spectacular sunrise skyscape captured in early June,\nthe parallel shadows and crepuscular rays\nappear to converge toward an eastern horizon's\nmore northerly sunrise. \n\nThe well-composed photo places\nthe rising Sun just behind the bell tower of a church\nin the town of Vic, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",
