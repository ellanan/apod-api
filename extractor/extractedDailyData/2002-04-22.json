  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan you spot the comet?  \n\nFlowing across the frozen \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ak.us/\">Alaskan</a> \nlandscape is an easily visible, colorful aurora.  \n\nJust to the lower left, however, well in the background, \nis something harder to spot: \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002c1.html\">Comet Ikeya-Zhang</a>, the brightest comet of recent years.  \n\nAlthough the <a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/weather/aurora/\">aurora</a> faded in minutes, the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/icq/CometMags.html#2002C1\">comet</a> is just now \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2002C1.html\">beginning to fade</a>. \n\nIt remains just barely \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/\">visible</a> without aid, \nhowever, before sunrise in the East.  \n\nThe comet is actually a giant \n<a href=\"ap010926.html\">dirt-covered snowball</a> \nthat spends most of its time in the outer \n<a href=\"ap020214.html\">Solar System</a> -- \nto where it is now returns.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/comets/gallery_iz_pg7.html\">above photograph</a> was taken on March 20 when \n<a href=\"ap020318.html\">Comet Ikeya-Zhang</a> was near its brightest.  \n\nCareful inspection of the photo will uncover \nseveral other sky delights, including the giant galaxy \n<a href=\"ap991114.html\">M31</a>.",
