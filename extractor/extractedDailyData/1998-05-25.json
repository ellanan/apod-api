  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nM83 is a bright \n<a href=\"ap970805.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nthat can be found with a small telescope \nin the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/HYA.html\">Hydra</a>. \n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/m83.html\">M83</a> \nis a member of the \nCentaurus group of galaxies, \na nearby group dominated by the massive galaxy \n<a href=\"ap970330.html\">Centaurus A</a>. \n\nIt takes light about 15 million years to reach us from \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m083.html\">M83</a>. \nThe spiral arms are given a blue color by the many \n<a href=\"ap970330.html\">bright young stars</a> \nthat have recently formed there.  \n<a href=\"ap980116.html\">Dark dust lanes</a> are also visible.  \n\nStars and gas in spiral arms seem to be responding to \nmuch more mass than is visible here, \nimplying that galaxies are predominantly \ncomposed of some sort of <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/matter.html\">dark matter</a>.  Finding the nature of this <a href=\"http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~dursi/dm-tutorial/dm1.html\">dark matter</a> remains one of the great challenges of \nmodern science.",
