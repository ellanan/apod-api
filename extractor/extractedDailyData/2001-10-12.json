  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nKnowing <a href=\"http://www.heavens-above.com/\">when and where</a>\nto look, many enthusiastic sky gazers have\nbeen able to spot the International Space Station (ISS) as\na bright star <a href=\"ap001214.html\">streaking</a>\nthrough the twilight.\n\nBut with a digital camera and a small telescope, recognizable\n<a href=\"http://www.hobbyspace.com/SatWatching/\">images\nare possible</a> too.\n\nAstronomer Ricardo Borba\n<a href=\"http://www.borba.com/iss/\">offers this example</a> of the\nSpace Shuttle\n<a href=\"ap010320.html\">Discovery</a> docked with\n<a href=\"ap010228.html\">the ISS</a>, recorded this August from\nhis backyard in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nOperating a digital video camera on an 8 inch reflecting telescope,\nBorba tracked the Earth-orbiting pair by hand.\n\nUnwanted telescope motion and atmospheric\n<a href=\"ap000725.html\">blurring</a> caused most of the\nvideo frames to be indistinct, still the single\nbest frame (left) from his video sequence  is amazingly sharp.\n\nFor comparison, he constructed a computer generated\nimage (right) showing the approximate orientation of the Shuttle/ISS docking\nconfiguration based on\n<a href=\"http://vesuvius.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/sehvrml.html\">virtual\n3D models</a> available\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/vrml/station/\">on the web</a>.",
