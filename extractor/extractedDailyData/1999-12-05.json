  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/rhea.html\">Rhea</a> is the second largest moon of \n<a href=\"http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/saturn.htm\">Saturn</a>, behind <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html\">Titan</a>, and the largest without an atmosphere.   \n\nIt is composed mostly of water\nice, but has a small rocky core. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/rhea.htm\">Rhea</a>'s rotation and orbit are locked together \n(just like \n<a href=\"ap991108.html\">Earth's Moon</a>)\nso that one side always faces Saturn.  \n\nA consequence of this is that one side always leads the other. \n\n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/pub/research/outerp/rhea.html\">Rhea</a>'s leading surface is much more heavily\ncratered than its trailing surface. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sat/rhea2.htm\">above photograph</a> was taken with the\n<a href=\"ap960629.html\">Voyager</a> 1 spacecraft in 1980.",
