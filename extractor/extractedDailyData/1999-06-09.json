  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow far away is this galaxy?  \nCosmologists the world over have been working hard to find out.  \n\nSpiral galaxy \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998ApJ...505..207T\">NGC 4414</a> contains many \n<a href=\"ap960110.html\">Cepheid variable stars</a> \nthat oscillate in a way that allows \nastronomers to estimate their distance.  \n\nFrom analyzing distances to galaxies like this, \nsome astronomers have \n<a href=\"ap990527.html\">recently announced</a> \nthat they have again refined their estimate of the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate96.html\">expansion rate of the universe</a>.  \n\nThe running debate over this \n<a href=\"http://www.hubbleconstant.com/\">rate</a> is not yet over, however, \nas another group of astronomers has \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999AAS...194.6202H\">recently announced</a> a distance that corresponds to a smaller <a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html\">universe expansion rate</a> from a \n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9906/02/hubble.doubt.ap/\">completely new method</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/jun3/n4414table.html\">NGC 4414</a> shows many classic \n<a href=\"ap980922.html\">spiral galaxy</a> features, \nincluding thick \n<a href=\"ap980116.html\">dust lanes</a>, \na central region rich in old red stars, \nand winding spiral arms glowing with young blue stars.  \n\nEven classic spirals contain new surprises, though, as an \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999AAS...194.8202F\">unusual blue variable object</a> has recently been found in \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997ApJ...490..682T\">NGC 4414</a>.",
