  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWielding a very wide-angle lens, astronomer Gordon Garradd was\nable to capture <a href=\"ap040503.html\">two</a> naked-eye comets in\n<a href=\"http://members.ozemail.com.au/~loomberah/2comets.htm\">one\npicture</a> looking\ntoward the west from Loomberah, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nAt the far left lies comet\n<a href=\"ap040422.html\">C/2002 T7 (LINEAR)</a>\nand at the far right, comet\n<a href=\"ap040512.html\">C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)</a>.\n\nRecorded on the night of May 20th, the area around\neach of the comets has been separately enhanced\nhere, making it easier to discern their extended tails\n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/\nwsolwind.html\">streaming away</a> from the Sun.\n\nWhile comet T7 (LINEAR) is the brighter of the two comets,\nboth are now fading.\n\nStill, they may be\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/\narticle_1262_1.asp#\">visible for</a> northern and southern\nobservers with Q4 (NEAT) easiest to spot in the north.\n\nOf course, with\n<a href=\"ap040521.html\">bright Venus</a> near the center\non the horizon and the lights of nearby Tamworth city glowing at the\nbottom right, the two comets are not alone in\n<a href=\"image/0405/2comets_garradd_c2_lab.jpg\">this\nheavenly view</a>.",
