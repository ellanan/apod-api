  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs the Helix Nebula looking at you?\n\nNo, not in any biological sense, but it does look quite like an eye.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_Nebula\">Helix Nebula</a> is so named because it also appears \nthat you are looking down the axis of a \n<a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Helix.html\">helix</a>.\n\nIn actuality, it is now understood to have a surprisingly\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/deadstar/helix.html\">complex geometry</a>, including radial filaments and extended \n<a href=\"ap230507.html\">outer loops</a>. \n\nThe Helix Nebula (<a href=\"https://grammarist.com/acronym/a-k-a-or-aka/\">aka</a> NGC 7293) is one of brightest and closest examples of a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>, a gas\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXNSYo8ZdoU\">cloud created</a> at the end of the life of a Sun-like star.\n\nThe remnant central stellar core, destined to become a \n<a href=\"ap231224.html\">white dwarf star</a>, glows in light so\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">energetic</a> \nit causes the previously expelled gas to \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/WnWIt0iz00A\">fluoresce</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=729866973075216&amp;set=a.149603584434894\">featured picture</a>, \ntaken in red, green, and blue but \nhighlighted by light emitted primarily by \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomyknowhow.com/hydrogen-alpha.htm\">hydrogen</a> was created from 12 hours of exposure \nthrough a personal telescope located in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greece</a>. \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwAKNMC2PeM\">close-up</a> of the\n<a href=\"ap080413.html\">inner edge</a> of the Helix Nebula \nshows complex gas knots the origin of which are  \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..758A/abstract\">still being researched</a>.",
