  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBetter known as\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/hinds.html\">Hind's Crimson\nStar</a>, R Leporis is a rare star in planet Earth's night sky.\n\nIt's also a shocking shade of red.\n\nThe star's discoverer,\n19th century English astronomer\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Russell_Hind\">John Russell\nHind</a>, reported that it appeared\nin a telescope \"... like a drop of blood on a black field.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://simbad.harvard.edu/simbad/\nsim-basic?Ident=R+Lep&amp;submit=SIMBAD+search\">Located</a>\n1,360 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"https://oneminuteastronomer.com/1206/vampire-star/\">constellation\nLepus</a> the star is a <a href=\"ap060722.html\">Mira-type</a> variable,\nchanging its brightness over a period of about 14 months.\n\nR Leporis is now recognized as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_star\">a carbon star</a>,\na very cool and highly evolved\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant\">red giant</a>\nwith an extreme abundance of carbon.\n\nExtra carbon in carbon stars is created by\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process\">helium\nfusion</a> near the dying stellar core and dredged up into the\nstars' outer layers.\n\nThe dredge-up results in an overabundance of simple carbon molecules,\nlike CO, CH, CN, and C2.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2018/\nhubble-views-striking-carbon-star-in-colorful-cluster\">While it's true</a>\nthat cool stars radiate most of their energy in\nred and infrared light, the carbon molecules\nstrongly absorb what little blue light is left and give\ncarbon stars an exceptionally deep red color. \n\nR Leporis is losing its carbon-rich atmosphere into the surrounding\ninterstellar material through a strong stellar wind though,\nand could be near the transition to a\n<a href=\"ap181020.html\">planetary nebula</a>.\n\nOh, and Happy <a href=\"ap161030.html\">Halloween</a> from the folks at APOD.",
