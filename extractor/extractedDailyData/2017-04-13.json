  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn April 10, a Full Moon and Jupiter shared this telephoto field of view.\n\nBoth were near opposition, opposite the Sun in Earth's night sky.\n\nCaptured when a passing cloud bank dimmmed the bright moonlight,\nthe single exposure reveals the familiar\nface of our fair planet's own large natural satellite, along\nwith a line up of the ruling gas giant's four Galilean moons.\n\nLabeled top to bottom,\nthe tiny pinpricks of light above bright Jupiter are\n<a href=\"ap020120.html\">Callisto</a>,\n<a href=\"ap141127.html\">Europa</a>,\n<a href=\"ap090920.html\">Ganymede</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap120408.html\">Io</a>.\n\nCloser and brighter, our own natural satellite appears to loom large.\n\nBut Callisto, Ganymede, and Io are physically larger than Earth's Moon,\nwhile <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/europa\">water\nworld Europa</a> is only slightly smaller. \n\nIn fact, of the Solar System's six\n<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/moons.htm\">largest\nplanetary satellites</a>, only Saturn's moon Titan is missing\nfrom the scene.",
