  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrophoton.com/PN_Abell78.htm\">Planetary nebula Abell 78</a>\nstands out in this colorful telescopic skyscape.\n\nIn fact the colors of the spiky Milky Way stars depend on their\n<a href=\"ap151224.html\">surface temperatures</a>,\nboth cooler (yellowish) and hotter (bluish) than the Sun.\n\nBut Abell 78 shines by the characteristic emission of\nionized atoms in the tenuous shroud\nof material shrugged off from an intensely hot central star.\n\nThe atoms are ionized, their electrons stripped away,\nby the central star's energetic but otherwise invisible ultraviolet\nlight.\n\nThe visible blue-green glow of loops and filaments in the\nnebula's central region corresponds to\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium\">emission from</a>\ndoubly ionized oxygen atoms,\nsurrounded by strong red emission from electrons recombining with\nhydrogen atoms.\n\nSome 5,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Cygnus, Abell 78\nis about three light-years across.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">A planetary nebula</a>\nlike Abell 78 represents a very brief\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/hubble-provides-holistic-view-of-stars-gone-haywire\">final phase in stellar evolution</a>\nthat our own Sun will experience ... in about 5 <i>billion</i> years.",
