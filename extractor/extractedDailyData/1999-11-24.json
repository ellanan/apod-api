  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe <a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/sights/meteors/leonids/9911leo.html\">1999 Leonids meteor shower</a> was not equally good for everybody.  \n\nOnly <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/info-events/leonids99/\">observers in Europe</a> and the Middle East with clear skies near\n2 am (UTC) on 1999 November 18 saw rates \nshoot up to a meteor every few seconds. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.skylook.net/\">Above</a>, however, is a picture taken from Spain \nduring this time, with over a dozen faint \nmeteors visible as \n<a href=\"ap981120.html\">green streaks</a> eminating from \n<a href=\"ap981208.html\">Leo</a> during just \na six minute exposure.\n\nAlthough more numerous, the \n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/leo99/leo99index.html\">1999 Leonids</a> did not have the same \nhigh proportion of bright meteors and fireballs as the \n<a href=\"ap981119.html\">1998 Leonids</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"ap991112.html\">Last year's Leonid fireballs</a> \nhave been \n<a href=\"http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/leopress.html\">traced back</a> to the 1333 passage of \n<a href=\"http://www.lowell.edu/users/farnham/tt/tthist.html\">Comet Tempel-Tuttle</a>.  \n\nThe orbit of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> continually deflected one stream of \ncast-off particles while the smallest \n<a href=\"http://leonids.hq.nasa.gov/\">meteors</a> in \nthis stream were removed by <a href=\"http://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/Library/Journals/J.Conf.Abs./1/222.html\">light pressure</a> from the Sun.  \n\nThe remaining <a href=\"http://leonidslive.com\">Leonids</a> were relatively large, \n<a href=\"http://www.umext.maine.edu/onlinepubs/htmpubs/4256.htm\">pea</a> sized or larger, compared to the <a href=\"http://www.paccd.cc.ca.us/instadmn/physcidv/geol_dp/dndougla/SAND/SANDHP.htm\">sand</a>-sized Leonids that are more common.",
