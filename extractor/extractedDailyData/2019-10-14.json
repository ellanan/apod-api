  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does the Andromeda galaxy really look like?\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kees-scherer/48847775697/\">featured image</a> shows how our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>'s closest major \ngalactic neighbor really appears in a long exposure through \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a>'s busy skies and with a digital camera that introduces normal imperfections. \n\nThe picture is a stack of 223 images, each a 300 second exposure, \ntaken from a garden observatory in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal\">Portugal</a> over the past year. \n\nObvious image deficiencies include bright parallel \n<a href=\"ap070825.html\">airplane trails</a>, long and continuous \n<a href=\"ap080604.html\">satellite trails</a>, short \n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/ccd/CCD_artifacts.html\">cosmic ray streaks</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://www.astro.rug.nl/~ndouglas/teaching/JAFFE/reduce.htm#BAD%20PIXELS\">bad pixels</a>. \n\nThese imperfections were actually not removed with \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop\">Photoshop</a> \nspecifically, but rather \n<a href=\"image/1910/AndromedaAfter_Scherer_960.jpg\">greatly reduced</a> \nwith a series of computer software packages that included \nAstro Pixel Processor, DeepSkyStacker, and PixInsight. \n\nAll of this work was done not to \n<a href=\"https://tenor.com/view/confused-dog-who-me-gif-14663746\">deceive you</a> with a \n<a href=\"ap131230.html\">digital fantasy</a> \nthat has little to do with the real likeness of the \n<a href=\"ap181217.html\">Andromeda galaxy</a> (M31), \nbut to minimize Earthly artifacts that have nothing \nto do with the distant galaxy and so better recreate \n<a href=\"ap190909.html\">what M31 really does look like</a>.",
