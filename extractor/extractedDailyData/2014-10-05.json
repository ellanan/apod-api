  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see?\n\nThe answer during the total lunar\n<a href=\"ap110625.html\">eclipse of 2011 June</a> was recorded in a dramatic time lapse\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/25808333\">video</a> from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan\">Tajikistan</a>.\n\nDuring a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_lunar_eclipse\">total lunar eclipse</a>, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, causing the moon to fade dramatically.\n\nThe Moon never gets completely dark, though, since the Earth's atmosphere\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/refr.html\">refracts</a> some light.\n\nAs the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQeejHExrGI\">above video</a> begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is a nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon.\n\nAs the moon becomes eclipsed and fades, the wind dies down and background stars can be seen reflected in foreground lake.\n\nMost spectacularly, the\n<a href=\"ap110617.html\">sky surrounding</a> the eclipsed moon\nsuddenly appears to be\n<a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MyGodItsFullOfStars\">full of stars</a> and highlighted by the busy plane of our\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nThe sequence repeats with a closer view, and the final image shows the placement of the eclipsed Moon near the\n<a href=\"ap080719.html\">Eagle</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960829.html\">Swan</a>,\n<a href=\"ap110513.html\">Trifid</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap091006.html\">Lagoon</a> nebulas.\n\nNearly two hours after the eclipse started, the moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full glare again dominated the sky. \n\nThe next total lunar eclipse will occur \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2014_lunar_eclipse\">this Wednesday</a>.",
