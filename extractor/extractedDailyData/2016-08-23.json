  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThat's \n<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon\">no</a> meteor.\n\nWhile watching and photographing this year's Perseid Meteor Shower, something unexpected happened: a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning#Gigantic_jets\">gigantic jet</a> erupted from a nearby cloud.\n\nThe whole thing was over in a flash -- it lasted less than a second -- but was fortunately captured by an already-recording digital camera.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6943/full/nature01759.html\">Gigantic jets</a> are a rare form of lightning \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v416/n6877/abs/416152a.html\">recognized formally</a> only a few years ago.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=128400\">featured high resolution color image</a>, taken near the peak of \n<a href=\"http://peakery.com/shikengkong-china/\">Shikengkong mountain</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>, \nmay be the best image yet of this unusual phenomenon. \n\nThe same event appears to have been \n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=128464\">captured simultaneously</a> by another photographer, further away.\n\nThe gigantic jet appears to start somewhere in a nearby \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud\">thundercloud</a> and extend upwards towards \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's ionosphere</a>. \n\nThe nature of <a href=\"ap070829.html\">gigantic jets</a> \nand their possible association with other types of \n<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Lightning_sprites.jpg\">Transient Luminous Events</a> (TLEs) such as \n<a href=\"ap951112.html\">blue jets</a> and \n<a href=\"ap150821.html\">red</a> \n<a href=\"ap141013.html\">sprite</a>s remains an active topic of research.",
