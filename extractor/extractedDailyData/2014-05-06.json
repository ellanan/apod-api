  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOur Sun has become quite a busy place. \n\nTaken only two weeks ago, the \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=20&amp;month=04&amp;year=2014\">Sun was captured</a> sporting numerous tumultuous regions including active sunspot regions \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjyjSrIt-b4\">AR 2036</a>  near the image top and AR 2038 near the center. \n\n\nOnly <a href=\"ap100609.html\">four years ago</a> the Sun was emerging from an \n<a href=\"ap080924.html\">unusually quiet</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle\">Solar Minimum</a> that had lasted for years.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/solar_nirvana2.html\">above image</a> was recorded in a \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/absorption.html\">single color</a> of light called\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">Hydrogen Alpha</a>, inverted, and false colored.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spicule_%28solar_physics%29\">Spicules</a> cover much of the Sun's face like a carpet.\n\nThe gradual brightening towards the Sun's edges is caused by \nincreased absorption of relatively cool solar gas and called \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/binstar/limbdarkening.html\">limb darkening</a>.  \n\nJust over the Sun's edges, several filamentary <a href=\"ap030707.html\">prominences</a> protrude,\nwhile prominences on the Sun's face are seen as light streaks.  \n\nPossibly the most visually interesting of all are the magnetically tangled active regions containing relatively cool sunspots, seen as white dots.  \n\nCurrently at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum\">Solar Maximum</a> -- the most active phase in its 11-year magnetic cycle, the Sun's twisted magnetic field is creating numerous solar \n\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO7j5LKmd3I\">sparks</a>\" which include <a href=\"ap110307.html\">eruptive solar prominences</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">coronal mass ejections</a>, \nand <a href=\"ap031029.html\">flares</a> which emit clouds of particles \nthat may impact the Earth and cause <a href=\"ap130609.html\">auroras</a>.\n\nOne flare two years ago \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/02may_superstorm/\">released such a torrent</a> of charged particles \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ukQhycKOFw\">into the Solar System</a> that it might have disrupted satellites and compromised power grids had it \n<a href=\"http://www.history.com/news/a-perfect-solar-superstorm-the-1859-carrington-event\">struck planet Earth</a>.",
