  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat caused the smooth floor inside the double ringed basin on Mercury?\n\nNo one is sure.  \n\nThe unusual feature spans 160 kilometers and was imaged during the robotic\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/index.html\">MESSENGER</a> spacecraft's swing past our\nSolar System's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)\">innermost planet</a> last week.  \n\nDouble and multiple <a href=\"http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/Planets/cratform.htm\">ringed basins</a>, although rare, have also been imaged in years past on Mars,\n<a href=\"http://www.gnewton.ca/fov/archive/venus_impact.html\">Venus</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater_Lakes\">Earth</a>, and Earth's Moon.\n\nMercury itself has several doubles, including huge\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloris_Basin\">Caloris basin</a>,\n<a href=\"ap090504.html\">Rembrandt basin</a>, and enigmatic\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.U21A0020P\">Raditladi</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raditladi_(crater)\">basin</a>.\n\nMost large multiple ringed basins on planets and moons are caused initially by a\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFs-W0twxKg\">forceful impact</a> by a single asteroid or comet fragment.\n\nOne interesting feature of the <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=338\">above-imaged double ring</a> is that the basin center appears much smoother than the region between the rings.  \n\nPossibly, the internal floor was smoothed by later volcanic activity.  \n\nAlso possible, however, is that the floor was smoothed by melting and\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboUARGa7Ik\">flowing</a> of material upon \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcGjtwpncx4\">impact</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> has now completed its last flyby of Mercury but will return and attempt to enter orbit in 2011 March.",
