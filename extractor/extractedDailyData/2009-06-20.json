  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis surprising view of the Full Moon\n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/\">rising on</a>\nJune 7 was captured\nwith a telephoto lens from a seaside balcony near Nice, France.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap050922.html\">orange Moon's</a>\ndark markings and odd shape put the photographer\nin mind of an alien creature's face staring down at the passing ship.\n\nOf course, the Moon's distorted appearance is due to the unusual bending\n(<a href=\"http://interactagram.com/physics/optics/\nrefraction/\">refraction</a>) of light rays\ncreating multiple images or\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nMirage_of_astronomical_objects\">mirages</a>, similar to\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/sunmir.htm\">sunset and\nsunrise mirages</a>.\n\nThe effects are most pronounced when\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/mirtemp.htm\">temperature\nlayers</a> in the atmosphere produce sharp changes in air density and\nrefractive index.\n\nActing over long sight-lines to the rising and setting Sun or Moon,\nthe refraction significantly alters the\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/gfmmform.htm\">path of\nlight rays</a> creating merged, distorted images.\n\nSuch mirages are also associated with the\n<a href=\"ap040321.html\">Green Flash</a>.",
