  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNow a second supernova in this same galaxy is repeating.\n\nThe cause is the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/asset/webb/gravitational-lensing/\">gravitational lens</a> effect of a massive foreground \n<a href=\"ap230912.html\">cluster of galaxies</a> (MACS J0138) -- \nit creates multiple images of a perfectly aligned \nbackground galaxy (MRG-M0138).\n\nWhat's \n<a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cats-being-funny-cover_675.jpg\">particularly interesting</a> is that this \nbackground galaxy has young stars that keep blowing up.\n\nAnd images of each \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/\">supernova</a> \nexplosion keep coming to us multiple times through different paths through the cluster.\n\nThe original lensed supernova set, shown in the \n<a href=\"image/2510/SupernovaLens_hubble_960.jpg\">rollover</a>, \nis called <a href=\"ap211102.html\">Requiem</a> and was first seen by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 2016. \n\nThis second lensed supernova set is called \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/53412181911/in/album-72177720305127361\">Encore</a> and was first seen by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/\">Webb Space Telescope</a> \nin 2023. \n\nMore images from these supernovas are predicted to be \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/webb/2023/12/21/supernova-encore-nasas-webb-spots-a-second-lensed-supernova-in-a-distant-galaxy/\">on the way</a>, and exactly when they arrive should help \nhumanity to better understand the mass distribution of the galaxy cluster, \nthe supernovas themselves, and possibly even \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/webb/2024/10/01/webb-researchers-discover-lensed-supernova-confirm-hubble-tension/\">the universe</a>.",
