  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan the Sun be eclipsed twice at the same time?\n\nLast Friday was noteworthy because part of the Earth was treated to a rare \n<a href=\"ap150321.html\">total eclipse</a> of the Sun.\n\nBut also on Friday, from a \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">part of the Earth</a> \nthat only saw part of the Sun eclipsed, a second object \nappeared simultaneously in front of the Sun: the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/\">International Space Station</a>.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/\">space station</a> \neclipses are very quick -- in this case only 0.6 seconds, they are \n<a href=\"ap110105.html\">not so rare</a>. \n\nCapturing <a href=\"http://www.astrophoto.fr/eclipse-iss-20150320.html\">this composite image</a> took a lot of planning and a little luck, \nas the photographer had to dodge a series of third objects that kept, \n<a href=\"http://www.animalpicturess.com/upload/files/actual/annoyed-cat.jpg\">annoyingly</a>, also lining up in front of the Sun: \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcrEqIpi6sg\">clouds</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwjvduR3_Ho\">above superposed time-lapse sequence</a> was taken from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fregenal_de_la_Sierra\">Fregenal de la Sierra</a> in southern \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nThe dark disk of the Moon dominates the lower right, while the \n<a href=\"ap140506.html\">Sun's textured surface</a> shows several \n<a href=\"ap150210.html\">filaments</a> and, over an edge, a \n<a href=\"ap130115.html\">prominence</a>.",
