  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did unusual spires form on comet \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast04feb99_1.htm\">Wild 2</a>?  \n\nClose inspection of \n<a href=\"ap040103.html\">images taken</a> of \nComet Wild 2 by the passing \n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/faq.html\">Stardust spacecraft</a> in January show numerous \nstrange pinnacles as long as 100 meters long jutting off the surface.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-154\">pinnacles were unexpected</a> - close-ups of \n<a href=\"ap010926.html\">other</a> \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">comets</a> and \n<a href=\"ap040619.html\">asteroid</a>s show no such features.  \n\nIn fact, no other \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> \nobject besides Earth is known to show such \n<a href=\"http://www.americansouthwest.net/utah/monument_valley/\">unusual structures</a>.  \n\nOther unusual \n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/photo/cometwild2.html\">Wild 2 surface features</a> including long cliffs, deep pits and craters, \nand <a href=\"ap961113.html\">numerous active jets</a>.  \n\nTogether with the spires, these features are \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-154\">hypothesized</a> to be indicative of a very rigid surface sculpted by impacts and explosive <a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/sublimation.html\">sublimation</a>.\n\nInitially, <a href=\"ap040319.html\">Wild 2</a> was expected by many to be held together only quite loosely.  \n\nStardust is scheduled to \n<a href=\"ap040119.html\">fly by</a> the Earth in 2006 and \n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/capsule.html\">drop off a sample</a> of Wild 2 for detailed scrutiny.",
