  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it be like to coast by Jupiter and watch it rotate?   \n\nThis was just the experience of the \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/mission/mission_timeline.html\">New Horizons</a> \nspacecraft as it approached and flew by Jupiter earlier this year.   \n\n<a href=\"http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Engineering_Graphics/_EG2001/mouse/history.html\">Clicking</a> on the image will bring up a \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/common/content/videos/JupiterRotation.mpg\">movie</a> \nof what the robotic spacecraft saw.\n\n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/missionPhotos/pages/021307_1.html\">Visible above</a> in the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/atmosphere.html\">extensive atmosphere</a> of the Solar System's largest planet are \n<a href=\"ap000429.html\">bands and belts</a> of light and dark clouds, as well as \n<a href=\"ap990718.html\">giant rotating storm systems</a> seen as \n<a href=\"ap990105.html\">ovals</a>.  \n\nOther movies compiled by \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/missionPhotos/pages/020707_1.html\">New Horizons</a> and \n<a href=\"ap000926.html\">other passing spacecraft</a> have captured the \n<a href=\"ap001123.html\">clouds swirling</a> and moving relative to themselves.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter\">Jupiter</a> \nhas a diameter of about eleven times that of our Earth, and rotates once in about 10 hours.\n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a> \nspacecraft continues to speed toward the outer \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> where it is expected to approach \n<a href=\"ap060828.html\">Pluto</a> in 2015.",
