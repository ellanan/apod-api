  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes, regions of planet Earth can be seen lit up with fire.\n\nSince <a href=\"http://www.nifc.gov/pres_visit/whatisfire.html\">fire</a> is the rapid acquisition of oxygen, and since \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/8.html\">oxygen</a> is a key indicator of life, \nfire on any planet would be an indicator of life on that planet.\n\nMost of the Earth's land has been \n<a href=\"http://www.fire.blm.gov/wlfstats.htm\">scorched by fire</a> at some time in the past. \n\nAlthough causing many a tragedy, fire is considered part of a \n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/GlobalFire/fire_2.html\">natural ecosystem cycle</a>.  \n\nThe year 2000 fire season in the continental \n<a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">United States</a> has been one of the most active on record, \nburning an area similar in size to \n<a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/\">New Jersey</a>.\n\nLarge forest fires on Earth are usually caused by \n<a href=\"ap000717.html\">lightning</a> and can be \n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/Fire/\">visible from orbit</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://fire.ak.blm.gov/unique/docs/elk/elk.asp\">Above</a>, stunned \n<a href=\"http://www.rmef.org/allabout.htm\">Elk</a> avoid a \n<a href=\"http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/viewrecord?2666\">fire</a> sweeping through \n<a href=\"http://www.state.mt.us/\">Montana</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.bvchamber.com/\">Bitterroot Valley</a> \nby standing in a river.",
