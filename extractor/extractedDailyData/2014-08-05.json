  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo place on Earth was safe.\n\nFour billion years ago, during the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean\">Hadean</a> eon, \nour Solar System was a dangerous shooting gallery of large and dangerous rocks and ice chunks.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7511/full/nature13539.html\">Recent examination</a> of lunar and Earth bombardment data indicate that the entire surface of the Earth underwent piecemeal upheavals, hiding our globe's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_Time_Scale#mediaviewer/File:Geologic_Clock_with_events_and_periods.svg\">ancient geologic history</a>, and creating a battered world with no remaining familiar land masses. \n\nThe rain of devastation made it difficult for any life to survive, although \n<a href=\"ap090830.html\">bacteria that could endure high temperatures</a> had the best chance.\n\nOceans thought to have formed during this epoch would boil away after particularly heavy impacts, only to reform again. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/new-nasa-research-shows-giant-asteroids-battered-early-earth/\">above artist's illustration</a> depicts how Earth might have looked during this epoch, with \n<a href=\"ap070623.html\">circular impact features</a> \ndotting the daylight side, and \n<a href=\"ap120402.html\">hot lava</a> flows visible in the night. \n\nOne billion years later, in a calmer Solar System, Earth's first \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent\">supercontinent</a> formed.",
