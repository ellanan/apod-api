  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow do galaxies like our Milky Way form?\n\nSince our universe moves too slowly to watch, faster-moving computer simulations are created to help find out. \n\nGreen depicts (mostly) hydrogen gas in the \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9za1CP9ImA\">above movie</a>, while time is shown in billions of years since the Big Bang on the lower right.\n\nPervasive \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/\">dark matter</a> \nis present but not shown.\n\nAs the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ASPC..396..453G\">simulation</a> begins, ambient gas falls into and accumulates in regions of relatively high gravity. \n\nSoon numerous proto-galaxies form, spin, and begin to \n<a href=\"http://static.desktopnexus.com/thumbnails/687708-bigthumbnail.jpg\">merge</a>. \n\nAfter about four billion years, a well-defined center materializes that dominates a region about 100,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> \nacross and starts looking like a modern disk \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18005\">galaxy</a>.\n\nAfter a few billion more years, however, this early galaxy collides with another, all while \n<a href=\"ap101127.html\">streams</a> of gas from other mergers rain down on this \nstrange and fascinating cosmic dance.\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/fabio/FGensenada.pdf\">simulation</a> reaches half the current age of the universe, a single larger disk develops.\n\nEven so, gas blobs -- some representing \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html\">small satellite galaxies</a> -- fall into and become absorbed by the rotating galaxy as the present epoch is reached and the movie ends. \n\nFor our \n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/MW.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, \nhowever, big mergers may not be over -- recent evidence indicates that our large spiral disk Galaxy \n<a href=\"ap120604.html\">will collide</a> and coalesce with the slightly larger \n<a href=\"ap090510.html\">Andromeda spiral disk galaxy</a> in the next few billion years.",
