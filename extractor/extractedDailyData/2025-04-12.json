  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/why-can-you-see-the-moon-during-the-day-we-asked-a-nasa-scientist-episode-19/\">Most of us watch</a>\nthe Moon at night.\n\nBut the Moon spends nearly as many daylight hours above our horizon,\nthough in bright daytime skies the lunar disk looks pale and can\nbe a little harder to see.\n\nOf course in daytime skies the Moon also appears to cycle\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/\">through its phases</a>,\nshining by reflected sunlight as it orbits our fair planet.\n\nFor daytime moonwatchers, the Moon is probably easier to spot\nwhen the visible sunlit portion of the lunar disk is large and\nwaxing following first quarter or waning approaching its third quarter phase.\n\nAnd though it might look unusual,\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/#h-daytime-moons\">a daytime moon</a>\nis often seen even in urban skies.\n\nCaptured here in a\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/astrocoy_/p/DIHPUxfMXNW/?img_index=3\">telephoto snapshot</a>\ntaken on March 12, a waxing daytime Moon is aligned near the edge of a\npopular observation deck that overlooks\nNew York City's borough of Manahattan.",
