  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever seen an entire rainbow?\n\nFrom the ground, typically, only the top portion of a rainbow is <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/09/17/circular_rainbow_rare_optic_effect_seen_from_the_air.html\">visible because</a> directions toward the ground have fewer raindrops.\n\nFrom the air, though, the entire 360-degree circle of a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow\">rainbow</a> is more commonly visible.\n\nPictured here, \na full-circle rainbow was captured over \nthe \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mg67iIFivDo\">Lofoten Islands</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a> \nin September by a drone passing through a rain shower.\n\nAn observer-dependent \n<a href=\"https://scijinks.gov/rainbow/\">phenomenon</a> \nprimarily caused by the \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/orders.htm\">internal reflection</a> \nof sunlight by raindrops, the <a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/bows.htm\">rainbow</a> has a full \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/24x910/what_is_the_diameter_of_a_rainbow/\">diameter</a> of 84 degrees.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> is in the exact \n<a href=\"ap190624.html\">opposite direction</a> from the rainbow's center. \n\nAs a <a href=\"https://hiawasseevet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/smiling-cat-for-web.jpg\">bonus</a>, \na <a href=\"ap070912.html\">second rainbow</a> \nthat was more faint and color-reversed was visible outside the first.",
