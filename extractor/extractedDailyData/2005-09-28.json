  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat kind of cloud is that?  \n\nLast week, a \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceflightnow.com/minotaur/stpr1/\">sunset rocket launch</a> \nlit up the sky and was photographed by \n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> as far as hundreds of miles away.  \n\nThe lingering result was a \n<a href=\"ap020926.html\">photogenic rocket plume</a>.  \n\nNot everyone who saw the resulting plume knew its cause to be a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur_%28rocket%29\">Minotaur rocket</a> \nlaunched from \n<a href=\"http://www.vandenberg.af.mil/_root/menus/topNav/aboutVAFB.asp\">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.   \n\nThe cloud was visible after sunset on 22 September.   \n\nFuel particles and water droplets expelled from the rocket swirled in the \nwinds of the upper atmosphere, creating an expanding \n<a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Helix.html\">helix</a>.   \n\nThe <a href=\"ap050619.html\">noctilucent</a> plume was so high \nthat it still reflected sunlight, where lower clouds in the foreground appeared dark.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.fottostudio.com/apod/20050922.jpg\">above image</a> \nalso captured part of the plume reflecting sunlight as a \n<a href=\"ap050613.html\">rainbow</a> or a colorful \n<a href=\"ap030311.html\">iridescent cloud</a>.   \n\nBelow the launch plume is the planet \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/almanac/s200509_alm.html\">Venus</a>.",
