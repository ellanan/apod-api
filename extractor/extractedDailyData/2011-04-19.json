  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA symphony of planet-wide observations began abruptly\non March 28 when the Earth-orbiting\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html\">Swift satellite</a>\ndetected a burst of high-frequency\n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/\ngamma.html\">gamma-rays</a> from GRB 110328A.\n\nWhen the same <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/\nbadastronomy/2011/04/07/\nfollowup-on-the-star-torn-apart-by-a-black-hole-hubble-picture/\">source\nflared</a> again after a\n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11824.gcn3\">45 minute pause</a>\nit was clear this event was not a typical\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nbursts.html\">gamma-ray burst</a>.  \n\nTwelve\n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11830.gcn3\">hours after</a>\nthe initial fanfare astronomers using the 2.5-meter\n<a href=\"http://www.not.iac.es/weather/index.php?v=webcam1\">Nordic Optical\nTelescope</a> chimed in with a mid-range observation of\nthe optical counterpart.\n\nEarly the\n<a href=\"http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11836.gcn3\">next day</a>\nthe explosion was picked up in baritone low-frequencies of radio waves\nby the\n<a href=\"http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/evla/\">EVLA</a> radio dishes in the USA.\n\nLater many optical telescopes, including the 8-meter\n<a href=\"ap030909.html\">Gemini North telescope</a> in Hawaii,\nbegan playing along by tracking the optical counterpart.\n\nThe unusual source was spotted at a higher register in\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkj5ZlAF4SY\">X-rays</a> by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory\">Chandra\nX-ray Observatory</a> and was intermittently\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7z147i9czI\">followed</a>\nin the even more soprano-like gamma-ray range for a week.\n\nJoining the chorus,\n<a href=\"ap090520.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> recorded\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2011/10/\">this\nimage</a> in optical  and\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\nir_tutorial/\">infrared</a> light,\nconfirming that the flash was located along the path of a galaxy at\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift\">redshift</a> 0.351.  \n\nIf associated with the galaxy, this explosion occurred when the universe was\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html\">about</a>\ntwo thirds of its present age.\n\nThere is much speculation that the unusual gamma-ray burst\nwas a star being ripped apart by a supermassive\n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18007\">black hole</a>\nin the center of a galaxy and the\n<a href=\"http://www.biojobblog.com/uploads/image/\ndemystifying%20science.jpg\">puzzling</a> features of the\ndistant detonation are still being explored.",
