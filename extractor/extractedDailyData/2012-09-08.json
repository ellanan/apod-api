  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/\nplanetary.html\">Launched on</a> a grand tour of the outer planets in 1977,\nby good fortune the twin Voyager spacecraft were\nalso headed in the general direction of the\n<a href=\"ap020624.html\">Sun's motion</a> relative\nto nearby stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/\nvoyager20120820.html\">Thirty five years later</a>,\nVoyager 1 appears to be nearing\nthe boundary of the Sun's heliosphere and interstellar space.\n\nOf course <a href=\"http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliosph.html\">the\nheliosphere is</a> the realm of the Sun\ndefined by the influence of the solar wind and the\nSun's magnetic field.\n\nBut how can you tell\nwhen your spacecraft crosses the boundary into interstellar space?\n\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/\nsigns_changing_fast.html\">One clue would be</a>\na sudden increase in the detection of energetic cosmic rays.\n\nThe high energy particles stream through interstellar space\n<a href=\"ap090801.html\">accelerated by distant supernovae</a>\nin our galaxy,\nbut are normally deflected or slowed by the heliosphere.\n\nCovering a 12 month period (September 2011 to 2012),\n<a href=\"http://voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliopause/heliopause/\nrecenthist.html\">this plot does show</a>\na dramatic increase in the rate of cosmic ray particle\ndetection in past months by the Voyager 1 spacecraft.\n\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/index.html\">Voyager 1 is</a>\nnow 18 billion kilometers (17 light hours,\n122 Astronomical Units) from the Sun and may soon\nbe the first spacecraft from Earth to enter the realm of the stars.",
