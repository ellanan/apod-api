  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/history-of-halloween\">Halloween's origin</a> is ancient and astronomical.  \n\nSince the fifth century BC, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween\">Halloween</a> \nhas been celebrated as a \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/halloween-derived-from-ancient-celtic-cross-quarter-day/\">cross-quarter day</a>, a day halfway between an \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/september-equinox.html\">equinox</a> (equal day / equal night) and a \n<a href=\"ap220321.html\">solstice</a> \n(minimum day / maximum night in the northern hemisphere).  \n\nWith a\n<a href=\"https://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-countries.html\">modern calendar</a> however, even though Halloween occurs today,\nthe real \ncross-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_days\">quarter day</a> will occur \n<a href=\"https://sonrisaeast.com/quarter-sun-cross-quarter-calendar/\">next week</a>.  \n\nAnother cross-quarter day is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day\">Groundhog Day</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZbtAFq7dP8\">.</a>\n\nHalloween's modern celebration retains \n<a href=\"https://www.neopagan.net/Halloween-Origins.html\">historic roots</a> \nin \n<a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/halloween-cat-costumes-19-57f75fe01d15b__605.jpg\">dressing to scare</a> away the spirits of the dead.  \n\nPerhaps a fitting tribute to this ancient holiday is \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/kt2rv5/\">this closeup view</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7380\">Wizard Nebula</a> (NGC 7380). \n\nVisually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)#/media/File:Arthur-Pyle_The_Enchanter_Merlin.JPG\">fictional ancient sorcerer</a>.\n\nAlthough the nebula may last only a few million years, some of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">stars being conjured</a> from the gas by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse\">great gravitational powers</a> may \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/startime.html\">outlive</a> our Sun.",
