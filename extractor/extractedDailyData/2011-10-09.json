  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThirteen years ago\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...193.3904A\">results</a> were\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....116.1009R\">first presented</a> indicating that most of the energy in our\nuniverse is not in stars or galaxies but is tied to space itself.  \n\nIn the language of cosmologists, a large\n<a href=\"http://super.colorado.edu/~michaele/Lambda/lambda.html\">cosmological constant</a> is directly implied by new distant\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/supernovae.html\">supernova</a> observations.  \n\nSuggestions of a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant\">cosmological constant</a> (lambda) were\n<a href=\"http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2001-1/\">not new</a> -- they have existed since the advent of\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm\">modern relativistic cosmology</a>.\n\nSuch claims were not usually popular with astronomers,\nthough, because lambda is so unlike known\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...685.1297P\">universe components</a>, because\nlambda's value appeared limited by other observations,\nand because less-<a href=\"ap071021.html\">strange cosmologies</a> \nwithout lambda had previously done well in explaining the data.\n\nWhat is noteworthy here is the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations and the good reputations of the\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/oir/Research/supernova/highz/members.html\">scientists conducting</a>\n<a href=\"http://panisse.lbl.gov/public/\">the investigations</a>.\n\nOver the <a href=\"ap980302.html\">past thirteen years</a>, independent\nteams of astronomers have continued to accumulate data\nthat appears to <a href=\"ap050925.html\">confirm</a> the existence of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a> and\nthe unsettling result of a presently\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe\">accelerating universe</a>.\n\nThis year, the team leaders were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/science/space/05nobel.html\">awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for their work.  \n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova//highz/figures/pictures.html\">above picture</a> of a supernova that occurred in\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AGM....14..P95D\">1994</a>\non the outskirts of a\n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a>\nwas taken by one of these collaborations.",
