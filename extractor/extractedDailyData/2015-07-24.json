  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA mere 2.5 million light-years away the Andromeda Galaxy, also\nknown as M31, really is just next door as large galaxies go.\n\nSo close\n<a href=\"ap061228.html\">and spanning</a>\nsome 260,000 light-years, it took 11 different image fields from the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/galex/\ngalex20120516.html\">Galaxy Evolution Explorer</a> (GALEX) satellite's\ntelescope to produce this gorgeous portrait of the spiral galaxy in\n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html\">\nultraviolet light</a>.\n\nWhile its spiral arms stand out in\n<a href=\"ap100109.html\">visible light images</a> of Andromeda,\nthe arms look more like rings in\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/galex/pia15416.html\">the\nGALEX ultraviolet view</a>,\na view dominated by the energetic light from hot, young, massive stars.\n\nAs sites of intense star formation, the rings have been interpreted as\nevidence Andromeda collided with its smaller neighboring elliptical\ngalaxy M32 more than 200 million years ago.\n\nThe large <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1170\">Andromeda galaxy\nand our own Milky Way</a> are the most massive members of the\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/localgr.html\">local\ngalaxy group</a>.",
