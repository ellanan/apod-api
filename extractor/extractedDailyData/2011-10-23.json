  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe New Horizons spacecraft took some stunning images of \nJupiter on its way out to Pluto.\n\nFamous for its\n<a href=\"ap110502.html\">Great Red Spot</a>, \nJupiter is also known for its regular, equatorial cloud bands,\n<a href=\"ap111022.html\">visible</a> through even modest sized telescopes.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=63\">above image</a>, horizontally compressed, was taken in 2007 near Jupiter's \n<a href=\"ap030424.html\">terminator</a> and shows the \nJovian giant's wide diversity of \n<a href=\"ap050911.html\">cloud patterns</a>.  \n\nOn the far left are clouds closest to Jupiter's South Pole.  \n\nHere turbulent \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w4V4AT9kVU\">whirlpools</a> \nand swirls are seen in a dark region,\ndubbed a belt, that rings the planet.  \n\nEven light colored regions, called zones, show tremendous structure, \ncomplete with \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00001187/\">complex wave patterns</a>.   \n\nThe energy that drives these waves surely comes from below.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a>\nis the \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/\nfastest_spacecraft.html\">fastest space probe</a>\never launched, has \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/mission/whereis_nh.php\">now passed the orbits of Saturn and Uranus</a> and is \non track to reach Pluto in 2015.",
