  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe developing \n<a href=\"http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/index.htm\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) has changed its \nappearance yet again.  \n\nLast month the \n<a href=\"ap010412.html\">Space Shuttle</a> \n<a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/atlantis.html\">Atlantis</a> visited the \n<a href=\"http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/sitemap.html\">ISS</a> and installed the third of eleven pieces \nthat will compose the \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/elements/its/\">Integrated Truss Structure</a>.  \n\nThe new <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/flights/9a.html\">S-1 Truss</a> is visible on the right, \nbelow the extended solar panels across the top.  \n\nThe world's <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/\">foremost space outpost</a> can be seen developing \nover the past few years by comparing the \n<a href=\"http://spacefLIGHT.NASA.GOV/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-112/html/s112e05823.html\">above image</a> to \n<a href=\"ap020423.html\">past</a> \n<a href=\"ap020102.html\">images</a>.  \n\nAlso visible above are many \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/flights/chron.html\">different types of modules</a>, a robotic \n<a href=\"ap010509.html\">arm</a>, several wing-like \n<a href=\"http://www.qrg.nwu.edu/projects/vss/docs/Power/1-what-are-solar-panels.html\">solar panels</a>, and a supply ship.  \n\nConstruction began on the \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/\">ISS</a> in 1998 and the core \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/space-station1.htm\">structure</a> should be in place before 2005.\n\nYesterday, the ISS celebrated its \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/releases/2002/02_212.html\">second anniversary</a> of continuous human habitation.",
