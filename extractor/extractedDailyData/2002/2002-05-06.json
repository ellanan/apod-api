  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThese two galaxies are pulling each other apart.  \n\nKnown as \"<a href=\"http://sites.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/11/prc/prc0211d.txt\">The Mice</a>\" because they have such long tails, each \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nhas likely already passed through the other and \nwill probably collide again and again until they coalesce.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/NAS/NAS.html\">long tails</a> are created by the relative \n<a href=\"http://www.clupeid.demon.co.uk/tides/simple.html\">difference between gravitational pulls</a> \non the near and far parts of each galaxy. \n\nScrolling right will show the very long tail of one of the galaxies.  \n\nBecause the distances are so large, \nthe whole thing takes place in slow motion -- \nover hundreds of millions of years.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1974ApJ...187..219S\">NGC 4676</a> lies about 300 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> away toward the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/com.html\">Coma Berenices</a> and are \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1961ApJ...133..726B\">likely members</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap020203.html\">Coma Cluster of Galaxies</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://sites.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/11/pr-photos.html#d\">above picture</a> was taken with the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s new \n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a> \nwhich is more sensitive and images a larger field than \nprevious Hubble cameras.  \n\nThe camera's increased sensitivity has imaged, serendipitously, \n<a href=\"ap000709.html\">galaxies far</a> \nin the distance scattered about the frame.",
