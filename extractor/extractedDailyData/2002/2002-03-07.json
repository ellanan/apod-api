  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#02C1\">In the last\nweek</a>, Comet\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002c1.html\">Ikeya-Zhang</a>\nhas become\nbright enough to be just visible to the unaided eye.\n\nBased on its present activity,\n<a href=\"http://www.rdcrisp.darkhorizons.org/\ncomet_page.htm\">observers are</a> optimistic that\n<a href=\"http://www.comet-track.com/iz/iz.html\">Ikeya-Zhang</a>\nwill become substantially brighter.\n\nThis composite\n<a href=\"http://www.astrostudio.at/2002c1ikeyazhang.htm\">color\nimage from</a> March 3rd, captured with a wide-field\ntelescope, shows this\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_iz.html\">active\ncomet's</a> bright, condensed coma and\na delightful array of subtle structures in its developing\ntail.\n\nThe bluish tail stretches for 5 degrees or so against a background of\nstars in the constellation Pisces.\n\nIn the coming days\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/Ikeya-Zhang/\nskymap_north.gif\">look for the comet</a> hanging low in the\nwestern evening sky (below a bright yellowish Mars), eventually\nbecoming difficult to see in the March twilight.\n\nBut after April begins,\n<a href=\"http://cometman.com/C2002c1.html\">Ikeya-Zhang</a>\nwill become a predawn object\nclimbing higher into the morning sky as the month progresses.\n\nCataloged as comet C/2002 C1,\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/\n2002C1.html\">improved orbit</a> determinations now\nmake it seem very likely that Comet\n<a href=\"ap020221.html\">Ikeya-Zhang</a> has been around here before.\n\nRefined <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/mpec/\nK02/K02D36.html\">calculations</a>\nindicate this comet's last trip through the\ninner Solar System was 341\n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/great_comets.html\">years ago</a>, in 1661,\nwhen it was <a href=\"http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/sbn/comet_data/\ncomet.catalog\">recorded</a> as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/\ncomets.html\">bright comet</a>.",
