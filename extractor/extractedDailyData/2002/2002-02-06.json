  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat cosmic wallpaper is on the sky?  \n\nThe answer depends on the \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">type of light</a> considered, and for some <a href=\"http://observe.ivv.nasa.gov/nasa/education/reference/emspec/emspectrum.html\">wavelengths</a>, all the \n<a href=\"ap000109.html\">cluttering material</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap000518.html\">foreground</a> makes it still unknown.  \n\nRecently, however, the background in near \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/infrared.html\">infrared</a> light was \n<a href=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/200201072mass.html\">imaged at high resolution</a> by the \n<a href=\"http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/2mass/pub/site/\">2MASS telescope</a>, and <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001AAS...199.3405K\">confirmed</a> \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...528...74K\">earlier estimates</a> that it is over twice \nas bright as originally expected.  \n\nA small section of \n<a href=\"http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics/html/infrared.htm\">Cosmic Infrared Background</a> (CIB) is shown above in representative colors. \n\nVisible is light emitted from the very first \n<a href=\"http://itss.raytheon.com/cafe/qadir/q225.html\">stars</a> and galaxies in the \n<a href=\"ap980121.html\">universe</a>, \nemitted when the \n<a href=\"ap990905.html\">universe</a> \nwas less than half its current age.  \n\nThe CIB is more uniform than the present \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_01.htm\">universe</a> since stars were more spread out at early times.  \n\nThe brightness of the \n<a href=\"ap000509.html\">background</a> indicates that \nmany stars were forming in the \n<a href=\"http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cosmo_exact.html\">universe</a> between cosmological \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~jh8h/glossary/redshift.htm\">redshifts</a> of one and seven.",
