  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBright light from a setting Sun and pale glow from a rising Moon\nboth contribute to this stunning picture of a rocket exhaust trail\n<a href=\"http://www.parres.com/john/photos/rocket.html\">twisting\nand drifting</a> in the evening sky.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.freqofnature.com/photos/mmiii/\">Looking west</a>,\nthe digital telephoto view was recorded from\n<a href=\"http://tmf-web.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Table Mountain Observatory</a>\nnear Wrightwood California,\nUSA on September 19, four days before the autumnal\n<a href=\"ap000923.html\">equinox</a>.\n\nThe rocket, a <a href=\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/nasm/dsh/artifacts/\nRM-Minuteman3.htm\">Minuteman III</a>\nsolid fuel missile, was far down range when the image was taken.\n\nLaunched from\n<a href=\"http://www.vandenberg.af.mil/30sw/launches/\nlaunches_images.html\">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a> it carried\nits test payload thousands of miles out over the Pacific Ocean.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sandiegohomeschooling.com/articles/\n2002/09-missle.shtml\">The red/orange color</a>\nfrom the setting Sun dramatically intensifies\nnear the top of the rocket trail, but below the sunset line,\nthe very bottom of the trail is faintly illuminated from the\neast by a nearly <a href=\"ap020705.html\">full Moon</a>. \n\nStill in full sunlight, the bright diffuse cloud at the top of the\ntrail, the result of a rocket stage separation, is tinged with\nrainbows likely produced by high altitude ice crystals forming\nin the exhaust plume. \n\nAstronomer\n<a href=\"http://www.w7ftt.net/photos.html\">James Young</a>\ncomments that the cloud takes on the\nappearance of a white dove flying from right to left\nacross the sky.",
