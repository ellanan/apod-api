  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOn 1996 March 22, a Galaxy and a comet shared the southern sky.  \n\nThey were captured together, from horizon to horizon, in the night sky above Loomberah, New South Wales, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/as.html\">Australia</a> by astronomer \n<a href=\"http://members.ozemail.com.au/~loomberah/\">Gordon Garradd</a>.\n\nGarradd used a home made all-sky camera with a \n<a href=\"http://www.zeta.org.au/~andrewa/ajaa31.htm\">fisheye lens</a>, resulting in a circular 200 degree field of view. \n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/images/96B2/96B2_960322_gg1.txt\">This gorgeous sky view</a> was dominated by the luminous band of our \n<a href=\"milky_way.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> cut by dramatic, dark \n<a href=\"ap990919.html\">interstellar dust clouds</a>. \n\nAlong with the bright stars of our Galaxy, the \n<a href=\"ap010804.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> \nis visible at the lower left.  \n\nThat night sky was also graced by the long, lovely, bluish tail of \n<a href=\"ap980717.html\">Comet Hyakutake</a>, \nwhich can be seen toward the top of the image, \nnear the bright star \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/hr/5340.html\">Arcturus</a>.  \n\nBright city lights from nearby \n<a href=\"http://www.tamworthonline.com.au/\">Tamworth</a> glow along the Northwestern horizon.",
