  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/\nplanetary.html\">Launched twenty-five years ago</a>,\nNASA's Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft are now over 10 billion kilometers\nfrom the Sun.\n\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/\ncurrent-status.html\">Still operational</a>, the Voyagers are\nbeing tracked and commanded through the\n<a href=\"http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/\">\nDeep Space Network</a>.\n\nHaving traveled beyond the outer planets, these remarkable\nspacecraft are only the third and fourth human built artifacts\nto escape our solar system, following in the footsteps of\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/\npioneer10-11.html\">Pioneer 10 and 11</a>.\n\nA 12-inch gold plated copper disk\ncontaining recorded sounds and images representing human cultures and\nlife on Earth, is affixed to each Voyager -\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html\">a\nmessage in a bottle</a> cast into the cosmic sea.\n\nThe recorded material was\nselected by a committee chaired by the late\n<a href=\"ap961226.html\">Carl Sagan</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/images/\nVgrCover.jpg\">Simple diagrams</a> on the cover\n(visible above) represent symbolically\nthe spacecraft's origin and give instructions for playing the disk.\n\nThe exotic construction of the disks should provide them with a long\nlifetime as they coast through\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/\ninterstellar.html\">interstellar space</a>.\n\nThe two spacecraft will not make a close approach to\nanother planetary system for at least 40,000 years.",
