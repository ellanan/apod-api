  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nRocks from space hit Earth every day.  \n\nThe larger the rock, though, the less often Earth is struck.  \n\nMany kilograms of space dust pitter to Earth daily. \nLarger bits appear initially as a bright <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a>.  \n\nBaseball-sized rocks and ice-balls \nstreak through our atmosphere daily, \nmost evaporating quickly to nothing.  \n\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/\">Significant threats</a> do exist for rocks near \n100 meters in diameter, which \n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">strike the Earth</a> \nroughly every 1000 years.  \n\nAn object this size could cause significant \ntidal waves were it to strike an ocean, \npotentially devastating even distant shores. \n\nA collision with a \n<a href=\"ap970629.html\">massive asteroid</a>, \nover 1 km across, \n<a href=\"ap980313.html\">is more rare</a>, \noccurring typically millions of years apart, but \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/doc/sentry.html\">could have truly global consequences</a>. \n\nMany asteroids remain \n<a href=\"http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/\">undiscovered</a>.  \n\nIn fact, one was discovered in 1998 as the long\nblue streak in the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/10/\">above archival image</a> taken by the \nHubble Space Telescope.\n\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Last week</a>,\nthe small 100-meter asteroid \n<a href=\"http://SkyandTelescope.com/news/current/article_641_1.asp\">2002 MN</a> was discovered only after it \nwhizzed by the Earth, passing well within the orbit \nof the Moon. \n \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2002mn.html\">2002 MN</a> passed closer than any asteroid since\n<a href=\"http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/media/press/1.htm\">1994 XM1</a>. \n\nA <a href=\"ap990425.html\">collision</a> with a large asteroid  \nwould not affect Earth's orbit so much as raise dust \nthat would \n<a href=\"http://www.permanent.com/a_impact.htm\">affect Earth's climate</a>.  \nOne likely result is a global extinction of \nmany species of life, \npossibly dwarfing the ongoing \n<a href=\"http://www.ran.org/info_center/factsheets/03b.html\">extinction occurring now</a>.",
