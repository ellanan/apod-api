  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a large \n<a href=\"http://www.opticalres.com/kidoptx.html\">lens</a>.  \n\nIn the above case, however, there are actually millions of lenses: \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/crystals.htm\">ice crystals</a>. \n\nAs water freezes in the upper \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">atmosphere</a>, small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals might be formed. \n\nAs these <a href=\"http://kristall.uni-mki.gwdg.de/homep1.htm\">crystals</a> flutter to the ground, much time is spent\nwith their faces flat, parallel to the ground. \n\nAn observer may pass through the same plane as \nmany of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset. \n\nDuring this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, \nrefracting sunlight into our view and creating \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/common.htm\">phenomena like parhelia</a>, the technical term for \n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/ice/sd.rxml\">sundogs</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/apple/\">above image</a> was taken in the morning of the 2000 \n<a href=\"http://www.teachervision.com/lesson-plans/lesson-3627.html?lnhp\">Winter Solstice</a> near Ames, \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ia.us/\">Iowa</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.  \n\nVisible in the image center is the Sun, while two bright \n<a href=\"ap990823.html\">sundogs</a> glow \nprominently from both the left and the right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/halo.html\">Also visible</a> behind neighborhood houses and trees are the \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/halo22.html\">22 degree halo</a>, three \n<a href=\"ap011107.html\">sun pillars</a>, and the \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/column.htm\">upper tangent arc</a>, all created by \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/spole.htm\">sunlight reflecting</a> off of atmospheric ice crystals.",
