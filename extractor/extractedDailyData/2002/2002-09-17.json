  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://physicsweb.org/box/world/15/9/6/pw1509063\">This tiny ball</a> provides evidence that the \nuniverse will expand forever. \n \nMeasuring slightly over one tenth of a millimeter, \nthe ball moves toward a smooth plate in response \nto energy fluctuations in the vacuum of empty space.  \n\nThe attraction is known as the \n<a href=\"http://physicsweb.org/article/world/15/9/6#pw1509063\">Casimir Effect</a>, named for its \n<a href=\"http://physicsweb.org/article/news/4/5/9\">discoverer</a>, \nwho, 50 years ago, was trying to understand why fluids like\n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/question617.htm\">mayonnaise</a> move so slowly.  \n\nToday, <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">evidence is accumulating</a> that most of the \nenergy density in the <a href=\"ap011231.html\">universe</a> \nis in an unknown form dubbed \n<a href=\"http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html\">dark energy</a>.  \n\nThe form and genesis of <a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9811454\">dark energy</a> is almost completely unknown, \nbut postulated as related to \n<a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/PAO/html/warp/possible.htm#vac\">vacuum fluctuations</a> similar to the \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/casimir.html\">Casimir Effect</a> but generated somehow by <a href=\"ap011202.html\">space itself</a>.  \n\nThis vast and mysterious \n<a href=\"http://cdms.berkeley.edu/Education/FAQ/question11.txt\">dark energy</a> appears to gravitationally repel all matter and hence will likely cause the universe to expand forever.  \n\nUnderstanding <a href=\"http://focus.aps.org/v2/st28.html\">vacuum fluctuations</a> is on the forefront of research \nnot only to better understand our universe \nbut also for \n<a href=\"http://focus.aps.org/v8/st25.html\">stopping micro-mechanical machine parts from sticking together</a>.",
