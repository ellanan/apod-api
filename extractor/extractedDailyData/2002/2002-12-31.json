  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nCould an asteroid destroy civilization on Earth?  \n\n<a href=\"ap000417.html\">Mountain-sized space rocks</a> could\npotentially <a href=\"http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/\">impact\nthe Earth</a> causing global effects, and perhaps even be\nmistaken for a nuclear blast of terrestrial origin.\n\nSuch large impacts are rare but have \n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">happened before</a>.  \n\nModern telescopes have therefore begun to scan the \nskies for signs of approaching \n<a href=\"ap020623.html\">celestial hazards</a>.  \n\nOver the past year, projects such as \n<a href=\"http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/\">Spacewatch</a> and \n<a href=\"http://spaceguard.ias.rm.cnr.it/SGF/\">Spaceguard</a>\nhave continually discovered previously unknown \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroids</a> that \nindeed pass near the Earth.  \n\nSuch projects are still rather modest, however.  \n\nIn June, 100-meter asteroid \n<a href=\"http://SkyandTelescope.com/news/current/article_641_1.asp\">2002 MN</a> was discovered only <i>after</i> it \n<a href=\"ap020817.html\">whizzed by</a> the Earth, \ncrossing even within the orbit of the Moon.  \n\nThis year brought much discussion\nin the astronomical community of \n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/pan-starrs/neos.html\">expanding technology</a> to discover most large \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Near Earth Objects</a> \nand extend the time between \n<a href=\"ap021009.html\">discovery</a> and impact for all \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/gamma/milkyway.html\">potential astronomical hazards</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.iaaa.org/exhibit/gall1.html#8\">Pictured above</a> is an illustration of a \n<a href=\"ap020724.html\">busy planetary system</a>, showing \nthe view of a planet ringed with space debris from a \nrecently formed crater of an orbiting moon.",
