  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow do dying stars eject their outer layers?  \n\nStars that create elegant \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebulas</a> like Henize 3-401, \n<a href=\"http://hubble.esa.int/hubble/news/image.cfm?oid=30272&amp;ooid=30277\">pictured above</a>, are not unusual, \ncausing speculation that, one day, our own \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a> \nmay look like this.  \n\nHenize 3-401 is one of the most \n<a href=\"ap020106.html\">elongated planetary nebula</a>s \nyet discovered, a particularly \n<a href=\"ap020618.html\">odd feat</a> for a seemingly round star.  \n\nPerhaps, some astronomers hypothesize, \nthe elongated shape gives a clue to the expulsion mechanism.  \n\nGenesis hypotheses include that the outer layers \nof gas are funneled out by the star's own \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html\">magnetic field</a>, and that a second unseen star is somehow involved.  \n\nAfter the gas disperses in a few thousand years, only a \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/dwarfs.html\">white dwarf star</a> will remain.  \n\nHenize 3-401 lies about 10,000 <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> away toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.emufarm.org/~cmbell/myth/myth.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/car.html\">Carina</a>.",
