  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nComet Ikeya-Zhang has become bright enough to stand out in the night sky. \n\n<a href=\"ap020221.html\">Discovered February 1</a>, \nthe comet has now just rounded the Sun and \nhas likely <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2002C1_1.html\">attained its peak brightness</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://SkyandTelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_477_1.asp\">comet</a> appears near the \n<a href=\"ap020227.html\">Sun</a> \nand over the next week moves from the evening sky \n(just after sunset) to the morning sky (just before sunrise).  \n\nMany <a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002c1_obs.html\">observers report</a> a current brightness approaching third magnitude.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_iz.html\">comet</a> is actually a \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">giant snowball</a> created during the \nearly days of our \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/astronomy/astronomy42/\">pushed out</a> by the gravitational tugs by massive planets.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002c1.html\">Comet Ikeya-Zhang</a> has been back to the inner \nSolar System at least once before in 1661.  \n\nAbove, the comet was photographed above \n<a href=\"http://www.canaries-live.com/UK/canaries-map.html\">Tenerife</a>, one the \n<a href=\"http://www.gobcan.es/\">Canary Islands</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sp.html\">Spain</a>.",
