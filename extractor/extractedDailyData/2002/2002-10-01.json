  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat could cause rectangular ridges on Mars? \n\nAs data flows in from the \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/overview.html\">two</a> \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/index.html\">spacecraft</a> currently orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>, \nsurface structures are seen that are not immediately understood.  \n\nThese structures pose puzzles that \nplanetary geologists are eager to solve, \nas they might provide clues to past processes that have shaped \n<a href=\"ap010628.html\">Mars</a> over billions of years.  \n\nOn the right of the <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/8_2002_releases/incacity/index.html\">above image</a> is an unusual \narray of ridges first spotted in \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/tmp/1971-051A.html\">Mariner 9</a> data in 1972. \n\nA ridge wall runs for about 5 <a href=\"http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Miscellaneous/ConversionTables/conversion_table.html\">kilometers</a>.  \n\nTwo competing progenitor theories include hardened \n<a href=\"ap010226.html\">sand dunes</a> and \nonce-molten rock that seeped through surface cracks and cooled. \n\nDubbed \"Inca City\" for their resemblance to stone walls of an <a href=\"http://emuseum.mnsu.edu/prehistory/latinamerica/south/cultures/inca.html\">ancient Earth civilization</a>, the new \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/overview.html\">Mars Global Surveyor</a> images now show them to be \npart of a larger circular pattern, \nindicating an origin possibly related to the \n<a href=\"ap001213.html\">impact crater</a>.  \n\n(Non-natural origin hypotheses are not invoked by \nconservative scientists unless clear indications exist \nthat natural processes could not work.)",
