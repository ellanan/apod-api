  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is going on in <a href=\"ap970228.html\">NGC 891</a>?  \nThis galaxy appeared previously to be very similar to our own \n<a href=\"ap000130.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>: a <a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">spiral galaxy</a>\nseen nearly edge-on.  \n\nHowever, <a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/HawaiianStarlight/English/Poster-NGC891.html\">recent</a> high-resolution \n<a href=\"ap990919.html\">images</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n0891.html\">NGC 891</a>'s dust show unusual filamentary patterns \nextending well away from its Galactic disk.  \n\nThis <a href=\"ap990509.html\">interstellar dust</a> \nwas probably thrown out of the galactic disk toward the <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/pr-04-99.html\">halo</a> by \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">stellar supernovae explosions</a>.  \n\nBecause dust is so fragile, its appearance after \nsurviving disk expulsion can be very <a href=\" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26A...362..138P\">telling</a>.  Newly discovered phenomena, however, sometimes \n<a href=\"ap980310.html\">appear so complex</a> that more \nquestions are raised than are answered.",
