  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTwo of the largest storm systems on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> are colliding, and nobody is sure what will result.  \n\nThe larger storm is the famous \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/redspot.html\">Great Red Spot</a>, while the smaller is a large \n<a href=\"ap970808.html\">white oval</a>.  \n\nBoth are <a href=\"http://www.firstscience.com/site/articles/cornell.asp\">swirling cloud systems</a> that circulate on Jupiter.  \n\nThe white oval is part of a \n<a href=\"ap970310.html\">belt of clouds</a> that circles \nJupiter faster than the Great Red Spot.  \n\nThe oval started being slowed by the \n<a href=\"ap990806.html\">Great Red Spot</a> two weeks ago and the \n<a href=\"ap981022.html\">collision</a> could last another month.  \n\nThe oval will <a href=\"http://space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/jupiter_storms_020131.html\">likely survive</a> but could possibly be disrupted or \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_988000/988346.stm\">absorbed</a>.  \n\nThe two storm systems went at it at least once \nbefore in 1975 causing the \n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/sights/moonplanets/redspot.html\">Spot</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/jupiter_storms_020131.html\">red color to fade</a> for several years.  \n\nThe passing \n<a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/vgrfaqs.html\">Voyager 2 robot spacecraft</a> took the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA01527\">above picture</a> of Jupiter's Great Red Spot in 1979.  \n\nA different white oval was then visible below the Spot.",
