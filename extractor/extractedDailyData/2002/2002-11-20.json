  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBeautiful and bright, the 2002 Leonid meteors battled against\n<a href=\"ap010906.html\">glaring moonlight</a>.\n\nThis winning example, from Tuesday morning skies above\nLaughlin, Nevada, USA, finds an undaunted\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/meteors/images/19nov02/\nWhittaker1.jpg\">Leonid streaking</a> between\nthe familiar constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/Education/\nOrionTourCenter/\">of Orion</a> (left) and an\noverexposed full Moon.\n\nAs anticipated,\n<a href=\"http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/why.html\">the Leonid shower</a>\npacked a double punch\non November 19 with planet Earth plunging through\n<a href=\"http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dust2002.html\">two dense clouds</a>\nof meteroids, dusty debris left by the passage of comet\n<a href=\"ap021116.html\">Tempel-Tuttle</a>.\n\nSome European observers reported 10 or so meteors a minute\nduring the first peak near 4:00 Universal Time while\nNorth American skygazers witnessed slightly lower rates near\nthe second peak around 10:30 UT.\n\nOverall, observed rates were much lower than last year's\nLeonid meteor storm, but for many the\n<a href=\"http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/Klumpke.html\">sky was still filled</a>\nwith a\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/meteors/\ngallery_18nov02.html\">rewarding spectacle</a> of bright meteors.\n\nAnd that performance may be a fond farewell for years\nto come.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/history.html\">annual\nLeonid</a> meteor shower will\nnot likely approach even these rates again until the end of\nthis century.",
