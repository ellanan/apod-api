  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did those big rocks end up on that strange terrain?\n\nOne of the more unusual places here on \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0011/earthlights2_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a> occurs inside \n<a href=\"http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/docs/usgsnps/deva/deva1.html\">Death Valley</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ca.us/\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.  \n\nThere a dried lakebed named \n<a href=\"http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/docs/usgsnps/deva/ftrac1.html\">Racetrack Playa</a> exists that is almost perfectly flat, \nwith the odd exception of some very large stones, one of which is \n<a href=\"http://pages.prodigy.net/pam.orman/joelandscapes/Landscapes_05.html\">pictured above</a>.  \n\nNow the flatness and texture of large \n<a href=\"http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/docs/usgsnps/misc/glossaryOtoR.html#playa\">playa</a> like Racetrack are fascinating but not \n<a href=\"http://epod.usra.edu/archive/epodviewer.php3?oid=89216\">scientifically puzzling</a> -- they are caused by mud \nflowing, drying, and cracking after a heavy rain.  \n\nOnly recently, however, has a \n<a href=\"http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/docs/usgsnps/deva/ftrac2.html\">viable scientific hypothesis</a> been given to explain \n<a href=\"http://geosun.sjsu.edu/paula/rtp/\">how 300-kilogram stones ended up near the middle</a> \nof such a large flat surface.  \n\nUnfortunately, as frequently happens in science, \na seemingly <a href=\"http://www.desertusa.com/mag99/july/stories/race1.html\">surreal problem</a> ends up having a \nrelatively mundane solution.  \n\n<a href=\"http://geosun.sjsu.edu/paula/rtp/dissertation/title.html\">It turns out</a> that high winds after a rain can push even \nheavy rocks across a momentarily slick lakebed.",
