  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat, in heaven, is that?  \n\nSometimes <a href=\"http://www.aas.org/education/career.html\">astronomers</a> see things on the sky they \n<a href=\"ap990928.html\">don't immediately understand</a>.  \n\nIn 1985 this happened to \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/19/bio/bio_gomez_english.html\">Arturo Gomez</a>, and the object became known as Gomez's \n<a href=\"http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/exhibits/food/panel6.html\">Hamburger</a> for its distinctive yet familiar shape.  \n\nAfter some investigation, the object was identified as a \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/palen/Research/nsf/intro.html\">proto-planetary nebula</a>, a gas cloud emitted by a \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a>-like star just after its central \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/1.html\">hydrogen</a> fuel has all been \n<a href=\"http://casswww.ucsd.edu/physics/ph7/StevI.html\">fused</a> to \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/2.html\">helium</a>.  \n\nGomez's Hamburger is on its \n<a href=\"http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/astro101/java/evolve/evolve.htm\">way</a> to becoming a full-fledged \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary nebula</a> \nin a few thousand years.  \n\nThe light seen (the bun) is \n<a href=\"reflection_nebulae.html\">reflected</a> by \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> from the central star, \nalthough the star itself is obscured by a thick\n<a href=\"ap000208.html\">dust disk</a> that \nruns across the middle (the patty).  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1987ApJ...316L..21R\">Gomez's Hamburger</a>, \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/19/table.html\">pictured above</a> in a recent image from the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nis only a fraction of a \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/question94.htm\">light year</a> across but located approximately \n10,000 light years away towards the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Sagittarius.html\">constellation of Sagittarius</a>.",
