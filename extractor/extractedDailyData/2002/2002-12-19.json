  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn December 11 <a href=\"http://www.raptor.lanl.gov/\nNoFrame_Archive.htm\">astronomers found</a>\none of the brightest and most distant\nexplosions in the Universe - <a href=\"http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/\nnewhome/headlines/ast26mar99_1.htm\">a gamma-ray burst</a> - \nhiding in the glare of a relatively nearby star.\n\nThe earliest image of the burst's visible\nlight was caught by an\n<a href=\"http://www.raptor.lanl.gov/\">earthbound RAPTOR</a>\n(RAPid Telescopes for Optical Response).\n\nThe two exposures inset above were taken by a RAPTOR unit\nabout 65 seconds (left) and\n9 minutes (top right) after high-energy radiation from\nthe burst, dutifully cataloged as\n<a href=\"http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/\nGRB021211/\">GRB 021211</a>, was identified by the\norbiting <a href=\"http://space.mit.edu/HETE/\">HETE-2 satellite</a>.\n\nOne of only two optical transients (OTs)\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/\nast27jan99%5F1.htm\">ever found</a> at times so\nclose to a burst's\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/gamma/milkyway.html\">gamma-ray\nemission</a>, the fading visible light source is indicated by arrows,\nblended with the image of foreground stars toward\nthe constellation <a href=\"http://www.starshine.com/frankn/astronomy/\nskychart.asp?abbr=CMI\">Canis Minor</a>. \n\nThe RAPTOR unit (lower inset) is designed with\nperipheral low resolution cameras and a central, sensitive\nhigh resolution imager, in analogy with a\n<a href=\"http://www.raptor.lanl.gov/\nNoFrame_SysOverview.htm\">predator's vision</a>.\n\nIn the future, the RAPTOR project expects its\ninnovative instruments to be able to\nindependently discover and catalog a host of cosmic things that go\n<a href=\"ap020228.html\">bump in the night</a>.",
