  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSpring reached the \n<a href=\"ap981216.html\">north pole of Mars</a> in May, \nand brought with it the usual \n<a href=\"ap011017.html\">dust storms</a>. \n\nAs the <a href=\"ap990705.html\">north polar cap</a> begins to thaw, \na temperature difference occurs between the cold frost \nregion and recently thawed surface, resulting in \n<a href=\"ap001009.html\">swirling winds</a> between the adjacent regions.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/dec02/npstorm/index.html\">above image mosaic</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/overview.html\">Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft</a> currently orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>, \nthe white material is \n<a href=\"http://www.west.net/~science/co2.htm\">frozen carbon dioxide</a> that covers much of the extreme north.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap011001.html\">choppy clouds</a> \nof at least three dust storms can be identified.",
