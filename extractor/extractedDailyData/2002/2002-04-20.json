  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFew astronomical sights excite the imagination like the nearby\n<a href=\"ap980411.html\">stellar nursery</a> known as\n<a href=\"ap970511.html\">the Orion Nebula</a>.\n\nThe Nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an\nimmense interstellar molecular cloud only 1,500 light-years away.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/images_hii.html\">This\ndistinctively detailed image</a> of the Orion Nebula was constructed\nusing data from the\n<a href=\"http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/GradProg/2mass.html\">2 Micron All Sky Survey</a> or 2MASS.\n\nUsing\n<a href=\"http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/2mass/pub/telescope.html\">telescopes in the</a> Northern and Southern Hemispheres of\nplanet Earth,\n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/overview/about2mass.html\">the\n2MASS project</a> has mapped the entire\n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/univ_index.html\">sky in infrared light</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/\">wavelength of infrared light</a> is longer than visible light but more\neasily penetrates obscuring dust clouds.\n\n2MASS cameras were sensitve to near infrared wavelengths\naround 2 microns or about 0.00008 inches.\n\nVisible light has a wavelength of about 0.00002 inches.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~mfs4n/milky/\">Survey\nobservations</a> in three infrared bands were translated to blue,\ngreen, and red colors to produce this composite image.",
