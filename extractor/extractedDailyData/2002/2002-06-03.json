  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are huge clouds of gas billowing from spiral galaxy NGC 4388?  \n\nThe extent of the gas clouds, over 100,000 <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light-years</a>, was unexpected before the \n<a href=\"http://www.naoj.org/Introduction/outline.html\">Subaru Telescope</a> took the \n<a href=\"http://www.subaru.naoj.org/Latestnews/200204/NGC4388/index.html\">above image</a>.  \n\nNGC 4388 has a bright energetic nucleus and so is classified as an \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html\">active galaxy</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral</a>, \nrelatively close by at 60 million light years, \nis a member of the nearest major \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/gal_clus.html\">cluster of galaxies</a>: the \n<a href=\"ap000220.html\">Virgo Cluster</a>.  \n\nOne <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002ApJ...567..118Y\">hypothesis</a> holds that the gas was stripped away as \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/ngc/ngc.cgi?4388\">NGC 4388</a> made its way through the  \n<a href=\"ap960419.html\">intergalactic medium of the Virgo Cluster</a>.\n\nA competing hypothesis holds that the gas \nis all that remains of a \n<a href=\"ap991003.html\">smaller galaxy</a> that was \n<a href=\"ap001102.html\">gravitationally deconstructed</a> \nby the larger NGC 4388.  \n\nFurther observations may better determine \n<a href=\"http://www.pa.uky.edu/~shlosman/gals/SEYFERT/HTML_PAGES/n4388.html\">NGC 4388</a>'s past and likely contribute to a better understanding of how \ngalaxies evolve inside \n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters.html\">massive clusters</a>.",
