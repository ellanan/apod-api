  "title": "Rays from an Unexpected Aurora",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis aurora was a bit of a surprise.  \n\nFor starters, last Friday morning, no intense \n<a href=\"http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~cyclopi/lesson1.html\">auroral activity</a> was expected at all.  \n\nPossibly more surprising, however, the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/aurora/gallery_01aug02.html\">aurora</a> appeared to show an usual structure of green \n<a href=\"http://www.baa-aurora.fsnet.co.uk/theaurora.htm\">rays</a> from some locations. \n\nIn the <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/aurora/images/01aug02/Anderson1.jpg\">above image</a>, captured from \n<a href=\"http://www.state.nd.us\">North Dakota</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>, a picket fence of green rays stretches toward the horizon.  \n\nMirroring the <a href=\"ap000519.html\">green</a> rays is a \n<a href=\"ap020115.html\">red</a> band, somewhat rare in its own right. \n\nLights from the cities of \n<a href=\"http://www.bismarck.org/\">Bismarck</a> and Mandan are visible near the horizon.  \n\nLarge sunspot groups indicate that activity from the \n<a href=\"ap020801.html\">currently active Sun</a> \nis relatively likely, possibly causing \n<a href=\"ap020101.html\">other streams</a> of \nenergetic particles to cascade onto the Earth \nand so causing more \n<a href=\"ap020121.html\">auroras</a>.",
