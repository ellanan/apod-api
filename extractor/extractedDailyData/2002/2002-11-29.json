  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOpen clusters of stars can be near or far, young or old, \nand diffuse or compact.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html\">Open clusters</a> \nmay contain from 100 to 10,000 stars, all of which formed at \nnearly the same time.  \n\n<a href=\"ap021201.html\">Bright blue stars</a> frequently \ndistinguish younger open clusters.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m035.html\">M35</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0794.html\">pictured above</a> on the upper left, is a relatively nearby at 2800 \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> distant, relatively young at 150 million years old, \nand relatively diffuse, with about 2500 stars spread out over a \nvolume 30 light years across.  \n\nAn older and more compact open cluster, \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/astron/const/Gemini/ngc2158.html\">NGC 2158</a>, is \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0794.html\">visible above</a> \non the lower right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002MNRAS.332..705C\">NGC 2158</a> is four times more distant that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001ApJ...546.1006B\">M35</a>, over 10 times older, and much more compact as it contains many \nmore stars in roughly the same volume of space.  \n\nNGC 2158's bright blue stars have \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">self-destructed</a>, \nleaving cluster light to be dominated by \n<a href=\"ap000815.html\">older and yellower star</a>s.  \n\nBoth clusters are visible toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/history/exhibits/constellations/timeline.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Gemini.html\">Gemini</a> -- M35 with binoculars and NGC 2158 with a small telescope.",
