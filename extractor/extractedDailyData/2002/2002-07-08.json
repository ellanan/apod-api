  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes staring into empty space is useful.  \n\nPictured above is a region of sky that was picked because it had, \nwell, nothing: no <a herf=\"ap010506.html\">bright stars</a>, \nno <a href=\"ap991114.html\">bright galaxies</a>, and no \n<a href=\"ap020213.html\">picturesque nebulas</a>.  \n\nWhat could not be avoided, however, were a few stars in \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw.html\">our own Galaxy</a>, and <a href=\"ap000709.html\">many distant galaxies</a> strewn across the universe.  \n\nNow the more distant galaxies have their \n<a href=\"ap010610.html\">light slightly deflected</a> \nby the gravity of more nearby galaxies, \ncausing them to appear slightly \n<a href=\"ap011007.html\">distorted</a>.  \n\nBy <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999AAS...194.8806T\">analyzing</a> these \n<a href=\"http://www.iam.ubc.ca/~newbury/lenses/research.html\">gravitational lens</a> distortions, \nnearby mass concentrations can be found, \nregardless of how bright they appear.  \n\nUsing this method, astronomers can now weigh entire \n<a href=\"clusters_of_galaxies.html\">clusters of galaxies</a> \nand search for large groupings of relatively \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter.html\">dark matter</a>.  \n\nCircled in the lower right of the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0712.html\">above image</a> is a cluster of galaxies that \nwas found not by its light, but by its mass.",
