  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.virgo-gw.eu\">From around planet Earth</a>\nthree gravitational wave detectors\nhave now reported a joint detection of ripples in spacetime,\nthe fourth announced detection of a binary black hole merger in the\ndistant Universe.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.virgo-gw.eu/docs/GW170814/\">The event</a>\nwas recorded on 2017 August 14, and so christened GW170814,\nby the <a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20170927\">LIGO\nobservatory</a> sites in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana,\nand the more recently operational Virgo Observatory near Pisa, Italy.\n\nThe signal was emitted in the final moments of the\n<a href=\"ap160212.html\">coalescence</a> of two\n<a href=\"ap170602.html\">black holes</a> of 31 and 25\nsolar masses located about 1.8 billion light-years away.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.virgo-gw.eu/skymap.html\">But comparing</a>\nthe timing of the\ngravitational wave detections at all\nthree sites allowed astronomers to vastly improve the location\nof the signal's origin on the sky.\n\nJust above the Magellanic clouds and generally toward the\nconstellation Eridanus, the only sky region consistent\nwith signals in all three detectors is indicated by\nthe yellow contour line in this all-sky map.\n\nThe all-sky projection includes the arc of our\n<a href=\"ap091125.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nAn improved three-detector location of the\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/en/\">gravitational\nwave</a> source allowed rapid follow-up observations by other,\nmore conventional, electromagnetic wave observatories that\ncan search for potentially related signals.\n\nThe addition of the Virgo detector also allowed\nthe gravitational wave polarization to be measured,\na property that further confirms\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nSticky_bead_argument#Einstein.27s_double_reversal\">predictions\nof</a> Einstein's general relativity.",
