  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf5-1.php\">Put a satellite</a>\nin a circular orbit about 42,000 kilometers from the\ncenter of the Earth and it will orbit once in 24 hours.\n\nBecause that matches Earth's rotation period, it is known as a \n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/page2.php\">geosynchronous orbit</a>.\n\nIf that orbit is also in the plane of the equator,\nthe satellite will hang in the sky over a fixed location in\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit\">a\ngeostationary orbit</a>.\n\nAs predicted in the 1940s by futurist\n<a href=\"http://www.clarkefoundation.org/about-sir-arthur/\">Arthur\nC.  Clarke</a>, geostationary\n<a href=\"http://www.satsig.net/sslist.htm\">orbits are in common use</a>\nfor communication and weather satellites,\na scenario now well-known to astroimagers.\n\nDeep images of the night sky made with telescopes that follow\nthe stars can also\n<a href=\"http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\">pick up geostationary\nsatellites</a> glinting in sunlight still shining\nfar above the Earth's surface.\n\nBecause they all move with the \n<a href=\"ap110601.html\">Earth's rotation</a> against the\nbackground of stars, the satellites leave trails that\nseem to follow a highway across the celestial landscape. \n\nThe phenomenon was captured last month in this video showing \n<a href=\"http://twanight.org/newTWAN/case.asp\">several satellites</a> \nin geostationary orbit crossing the famous \n<a href=\"ap151123.html\">Orion Nebula</a>.",
