  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if there were two moons in the sky -- and they eclipsed each other?\n\nThis happens on \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/\">Mars</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53339474142/in/photostream/ \">featured video</a> shows a version of this unusual eclipse from space.\n\nPictured are the two moons of Mars: the larger \n<a href=\"ap230731.html\">Phobos</a>, \nwhich orbits closer to the red planet, and the smaller \n<a href=\"ap010902.html\">Deimos</a>, which orbits further out.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53339522052/\">The sequence</a> was captured last year by the \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>’s \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express\">Mars Express</a>, \na robotic spacecraft that itself orbits \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a>.\n\nA similar \n<a href=\"ap220509.html\">eclipse is visible</a> \nfrom the Martian surface, although very rarely. \n\nFrom the surface, though, the closer moon \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)#/media/File:Phobos_fly-by_animation_ESA223006.gif\">Phobos would appear</a> \nto pass in front of farther moon Deimos.\n\n<a href=\"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article27598932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_SWNS_SURPRISED_DOG_008.jpg\">Most oddly</a>, \nPhobos orbits Mars so close that it appears to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonrise_and_moonset#Direction\">move backwards</a> when compared to \n<a href=\"ap220421.html\">Earth's Moon</a> from Earth, \nrising in west and setting in the east.\n\n<a href=\"ap220703.html\">Phobos</a>, the closer moon, \norbits so close and so fast that it passes \nnearly overhead about three times a day.",
