  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo other stars have \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate100th.html\">planetary systems like our own</a>?\n\nYes -- one such system is \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA22193\">Kepler-90</a>.\n\nCataloged by the  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index.html\">Kepler satellite</a> that operated from Earth orbit between 2009 and 2018,  \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2017-321\">eight planets</a> were discovered, giving Kepler-90 \nthe same number of known planets as our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">Solar System</a>.\n\nSimilarities between Kepler-90 and our system include a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star\">G-type star</a> comparable to our Sun, rocky planets comparable to our Earth, \nand large planets comparable in size to \n<a href=\"ap170523.html\">Jupiter</a> and \n<a href=\"ap200419.html\">Saturn</a>.\n\nDifferences include that all of the known \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uzv-tEa7SI\">Kepler-90</a> \nplanets orbit relatively close in -- closer than \nEarth's orbit around the Sun -- making them possibly too hot to \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate100th.html\">harbor life</a>.\n\nHowever, observations over longer time periods may discover \n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WbbTXMQyrc/TYrKOKNZZBI/AAAAAAACB50/wqhFnRgAIIo/s400/boo_Pomeranian_Dog_19.jpg\">cooler planets</a> farther out.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-90\">Kepler-90</a> lies about 2,500 light years away, and at magnitude 14 is visible with a medium-sized telescope toward the constellation of the Dragon \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(constellation)\">Draco</a>). \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.searchforlife.net/exoplanet-missions/\">exoplanet-finding mission</a> \n<a href=\"https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">TESS</a> was launched in 2018, while\nmissions with exoplanet finding capability planned for launch in the next decade include \nNASA's \n<a href=\"ap160509.html\">JWST</a> and \n<a href=\"https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">WFIRST</a>.",
