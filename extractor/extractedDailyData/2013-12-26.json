  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGorgeous spiral galaxy M33 seems to have more than its fair share of\nglowing hydrogen gas.\n\nA prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also\nknown as the <a href=\"ap121220.html\">Triangulum Galaxy</a> and\nlies about 3 million light-years distant. \n\nIts inner 30,000 light-years are shown in this\n<a href=\"http://skycenter.arizona.edu/gallery/Galaxies/M33\">telescopic\ngalaxy portrait</a>\nthat enhances the reddish ionized hydrogen\nclouds or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region\">HII regions</a>.\n\nSprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core,\n<a href=\"ap121211.html\">M33's giant HII regions</a> are some of the\nlargest known stellar nurseries,\nsites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars.\n\nIntense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes the\nsurrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the characteristic red\nglow.\n\nTo enhance this image, broadband data was used to produce a color view\nof the galaxy and combined with narrowband data recorded through a\nhydrogen-alpha filter, transmitting the light of the strongest hydrogen\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/\nabsorption.html\">emission line</a>.\n\nTo see the monochromatic narrowband data alone,\nmove your cursor over the image, or take this\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/81936802\">video tour of the hydrogen clouds\nof M33</a>.",
