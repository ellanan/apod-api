  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere did all these high energy positrons come from?\n\nThe <a href=\"http://ams.nasa.gov/\">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</a> (AMS-02) onboard the \n<a href=\"ap110309.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) \nhas been meticulously recording how often it is struck by both high energy electrons and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron\">positrons</a> since 2011.\n\nAfter accumulating years of data, it has now become clear \nthat there are significantly more positrons than expected \nat the highest energies detected. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://ams.nasa.gov/Documents/AMS_Publications/PhysRevLett.113.121102.pdf\">excess</a> may have a very exciting and profound origin -- the annihilation of distant but previously undetected <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter/\">dark matter</a> particles.  \n\nHowever, it is also possible that astronomical sources such as \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/pulsars.html\">pulsars</a> \nare creating the \n<a href=\"http://funny-pics.co/wp-content/uploads/funny-cat-in-the-fence-picture.jpg\">unexplained discrepancy</a>.\n\nThe topic remains a very active area of research.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/9494533149/in/set-72157627325391959\">Pictured here</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer\">AMS</a> is visible on the ISS just after being installed, with a US \n<a href=\"ap110709.html\">Space Shuttle</a> docked on the far right, a Russian \n<a href=\"ap051101.html\">Soyuz capsule</a> docked on the far left, and the \n<a href=\"ap100713.html\">blue Earth</a> that houses all nations visible across the background.",
