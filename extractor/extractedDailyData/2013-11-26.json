  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne might say this was a bell weather day for the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(Spain)\">Sierra Nevada mountains</a>. \n\nIn January, just as the Sun was setting above the district of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albayz%C3%ADn\">Albayz�n</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada\">Grenada</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>, \na huge cloud appeared as a bell capping the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veleta_(Sierra_Nevada)\">Veleta peak</a>. \n\nSuch a \n<a href=\"http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wxfacts/Cap-cloud.htm\">Cap cloud</a> is formed by air forced upwards by a \n<a href=\"ap110417.html\">mountain peak</a>, with the air then \n<a href=\"http://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/cool-cat.jpg\">cooling</a>, saturating with moisture, \nand finally having its \n<a href=\"http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/mdapplet.html\">molecular</a> water condense into \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm\">cloud droplets</a>.\n\nSuch a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_(instrument)\">bell</a>-shaped \ncloud structure is unusual as air typically moves horizontally, making most clouds \n<a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080716233244AAvR99X\">nearly flat</a> across at the bottom. \n\nVertical waves can also give additional \n<a href=\"ap050821.html\">lenticular cloud</a> layers, as also seen above.\n\nGiven the fleeting extent of the great cloud coupled with \nmomentarily excellent \n<a href=\"ap081205.html\">sunset coloring</a>, \none might considered this also a \n<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bellwether\">bellwether</a> day \nfor an accomplished photographer.",
