  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's rising above the horizon behind those clouds?\n\nIt's the Sun. \n\nMost sunrises don't look\n<a href=\"https://i0.hippopx.com/photos/807/839/788/cat-pet-cat-cat-maine-coon-cat-preview.jpg\">like this</a>, though, \nbecause most sunrises don't include the Moon.\n\nIn the early morning of 2013 May 10, however, from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia\">Western</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, \nthe Moon was between the Earth and the rising \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>. \n\nAt times, it would be hard for the \n<a href=\"ap130513.html\">uninformed</a> to understand what was happening. \n\nIn an <a href=\"https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x630/annular-solar-eclipse.png\">annular eclipse</a>, the Moon is too far from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> \nto block the entire Sun, and at most leaves a \n<a href=\"ap170301.html\">ring of fire</a> \nwhere sunlight pours out around every edge of the Moon. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJfpqSj7cCs?t=10\">featured time-lapse video</a> \nalso recorded the eclipse through the high refraction of the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> just above the horizon, making the \n<a href=\"ap191228.html\">unusual rising Sun and Moon</a> appear also \n<a href=\"ap230502.html\">flattened</a>. \n\nAs the video continues, the Sun continues to rise, \nwhile the \n<a href=\"ap150403.html\">Sun and Moon</a> begin to separate. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eclipses/2023/oct-14-annular/where-when/\">next annular solar eclipse</a> will occur in less than three weeks. \n\n\nOn Saturday, October 14, a \n<a href=\"ap030605.html\">ring of fire</a> will be visible \nthrough clear skies from a thin swath crossing both \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#/media/File:Americas_(orthographic_projection).svg\">North and South America</a>.",
