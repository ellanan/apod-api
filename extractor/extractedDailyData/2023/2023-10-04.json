  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes this nebula look like the head of a witch?\n\nThe nebula is \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/todays-image/witch-head-nebula-orion/\">known popularly</a> as the Witch Head Nebula because, it is said, \nthe nebula's shape resembles a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween#/media/File:Halloween_Witch_2011.JPG\">Halloween-style caricature</a> of a witch's head.\n\nExactly how, though, can be a topic of imaginative speculation. \n\nWhat is clear is that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2118\">IC 2118</a> is about 50 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-years</a> \nacross and made of gas and dust that points to -- \nbecause it has been partly eroded by -- the nearby star \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel\">Rigel</a>.\n\nOne of the brighter stars in the constellation Orion, \n<a href=\"ap230407.html\">Rigel</a> lies below the bottom of the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqdsZ47M7xc/\">featured image</a>.\n\nThe blue color of the Witch Head Nebula and is caused not only by \n<a href=\"ap220124.html\">Rigel's intense blue starlight</a> \nbut because the \n<a href=\"https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/dust/\">dust grains</a> \nscatter blue light more efficiently than red. \n\nThe same <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html\">physical process</a> causes Earth's daytime \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">sky to appear blue</a>, \nalthough the scatterers in planet \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-atmospheric-layers-3/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> are molecules of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-curiosity-rover-finds-biologically-useful-nitrogen-on-mars/\">nitrogen</a> and \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/lightning-oxygen-and-life-detection/\">oxygen</a>.",
