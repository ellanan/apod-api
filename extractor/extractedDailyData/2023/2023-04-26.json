  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWas this a lucky shot?\n\nAlthough many amazing photographs are taken by someone who just happened&nbsp;to be in the right place at the right time, \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CrER4JxslXM/\">this image</a> took skill and careful planning.\n\nFirst was the angular&nbsp;scale: if you shoot too close to the famous \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe\">Arc de Triomphe</a> in \n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/72kRM86V-dw\">Paris</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>, \nthe full moon will appear too small.&nbsp;\n\nConversely, if you shoot from too far away, the moon will&nbsp;appear&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://media-be.chewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29114842/pet-boops-main.jpg\">too large</a> and not fit inside \n<a href=\"https://www.paris-arc-de-triomphe.fr/\">the Arc</a>.\n\nSecond is timing: \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/moon-phases/\">the Moon</a> only appears centered inside \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/agnZuZkqW-M\">the Arc</a> \nfor small periods of time -- from this distance less than a minute.\n\nOther <a href=\"ap210913.html\">planned</a> features include lighting, relative \n<a href=\"ap230308.html\">brightness</a>, \n<a href=\"ap110417.html\">height</a>, capturing a \n<a href=\"ap221213.html\">good foreground</a>, and digital processing. \n\nAnd yes, there is some luck involved -- for example, \n<a href=\"ap220321.html\">the sky</a> must be clear.\n\nThis time, the planning was successful, \nbringing two of humanity's most famous icons photographically together for all \n<a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/happy-cat-smiling-23__880.jpg\">to enjoy</a>.",
