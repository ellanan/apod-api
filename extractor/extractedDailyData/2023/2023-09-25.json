  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening to this spiral galaxy?\n\nJust a few hundred million years ago, \nNGC 2936, the upper of the two large \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHlYCyJKDR/\">galaxies shown</a> at the bottom, was likely a \n<a href=\"ap130416.html\">normal spiral galaxy</a> -- \nspinning, creating stars -- and minding its own business.\n\nBut then it got too close to the \n<a href=\"ap120914.html\">massive elliptical galaxy</a> \nNGC 2937, just below, and took a turn.\n\nSometimes dubbed the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird#/media/File:Ruby-Throated_Hummingbird.png\">Hummingbird</a> Galaxy for its iconic shape, \nNGC 2936 is not only being deflected but also being distorted by the \n<a href=\"ap211004.html\">close gravitational interaction</a>.\n\nBehind filaments of dark \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">interstellar dust</a>, bright blue stars form the \nnose of the hummingbird, while the center of the spiral appears as an eye. \n\nAlternatively, the galaxy pair, together known as \n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/videos/heic1311a/\">Arp 142</a>, \nlook to some like \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise\">Porpoise</a> or a \n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:African_Penguin_with_egg_%2843841665775%29.jpg\">penguin</a> protecting an egg.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHlYCyJKDR/\">featured re-processed image</a> showing \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AAS...22713511R/abstract\">Arp 142</a> in great detail was taken recently by the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nArp 142 lies about 300 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> \naway toward the constellation of the Water Snake \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(constellation)\">Hydra</a>).\n\nIn a billion years or so the \n<a href=\"ap120604.html\">two galaxies will likely merge</a> into one larger galaxy.",
