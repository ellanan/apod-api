  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nIn visible light NGC 1333 is seen as a\n<a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/astro/cosmos/R/Reflection+Nebula\">reflection nebula</a>,\ndominated by bluish hues characteristic of starlight reflected by\ninterstellar dust.\n\nA mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/per/index.html\">Perseus</a>,\nit lies at the edge of a large, star-forming molecular cloud.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2023/hubble-celebrates-33rd-anniversary-with-a-peek-into-nearby-star-forming-region\">This Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nclose-up frames a region just over 1 light-year\nwide at the estimated distance of NGC 1333.\n\nIt shows details of the dusty region\nalong with telltale hints of contrasty red emission from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig-Haro_object#Discovery_and_history_of_observations\">Herbig-Haro</a>\nobjects, <a href=\"ap140204.html\">jets and shocked glowing gas</a>\nemanating from recently formed stars.\n\nIn fact, NGC 1333 contains hundreds of stars less than\na million years old, most still\n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/224-ssc2005-24-Beautiful-Chaos-of-Star-Birth\">hidden from optical telescopes</a>\nby the <a href=\"ap210318.html\">pervasive stardust</a>.\n\nThe chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun\nformed over 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-012\">Hubble's stunning image</a>\nof the stellar nursery was released to celebrate\nthe 33rd anniversary of the space telescope's launch.",
