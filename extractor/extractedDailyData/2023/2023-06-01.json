  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMassive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives. \n\nCollapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces\nignite and create heavy elements in their cores.\n\nAfter a few million years, the\n<a href=\"ap190801.html\">enriched material</a> is blasted\nback into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew.\n\nThe expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example\nof this final phase of the stellar life cycle.\n\nLight from the explosion which created this supernova remnant\nwould have been first\n<a href=\"https://spider.seds.org/spider/Vars/casA.html\">seen in planet Earth's sky</a>\nabout 350 years ago,\nalthough it took that light about 11,000 years to reach us.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/the-latest-look-at-first-light-from-chandra.html\">This false-color image, composed of X-ray and optical image data</a>\nfrom the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope,\nshows the still hot filaments and knots in the remnant.\n\nIt spans about 30 light-years at the estimated distance of Cassiopeia A.\n\nHigh-energy X-ray emission from specific elements has been color coded,\nsilicon in red, sulfur in yellow, calcium in green\nand iron in purple, to help\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7316\">astronomers explore</a>\nthe recycling of our galaxy's\n<a href=\"ap171119.html\">star stuff</a>.\n\nStill expanding, the outer blast wave is seen in blue hues.\n\n<a href=\"ap170501.html\">The bright speck</a>\nnear the center is a neutron star,\nthe incredibly dense, collapsed remains of the massive stellar core.",
