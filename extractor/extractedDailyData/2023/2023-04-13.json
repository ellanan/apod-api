  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nStars of the globular cluster NGC 2419 are packed into this\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2023/hubble-spies-a-multi-generational-cluster\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/potw1908a/\">field of view</a>\ntoward the mostly stealthy constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28constellation%29\">Lynx</a>.\n\nThe two brighter spiky stars near the edge of the frame are\nwithin our own galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2419.html\">NGC 2419</a>\nitself is remote though, some 300,000 light-years away.\n\nIn comparison, the Milky Way's satellite galaxy, the\n<a href=\"ap130528.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>, is only\nabout 160,000 light-years distant.\n\nRoughly similar to other large globular star clusters like\n<a href=\"ap140529.html\">Omega Centauri</a>, NGC 2419\nis intrinsically bright, but appears faint because\nit is so far away.\n\nIts extreme distance makes it difficult to\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01416\">study</a>\nand compare its properties with other\nglobular clusters that roam the halo of\nour Milky Way galaxy.\n\nSometimes called \"the Intergalactic Wanderer\",\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4499\">NGC 2419</a> really\ndoes seem to have come from beyond the Milky Way.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...598L...9M/abstract\">Measurements</a>\nof the cluster's motion through space suggest\nit once belonged to the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_Dwarf_Spheroidal_Galaxy\">Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy</a>,\nanother small satellite galaxy being disrupted by repeated encounters\nwith the much larger Milky Way.",
