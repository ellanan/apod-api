  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan dust be beautiful?\n\nYes, and it can also be useful. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_molecular_cloud\">Taurus molecular cloud</a> has several bright stars, \nbut it is the \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180626.html\">dark dust</a> that really \n<a href=\"https://www.selfsufficientculture.com/attachments/cat-dog-chickens-looking-into-kitchen-through-window-jpeg.811/\">draws attention</a>. \n\nThe pervasive \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">dust</a> \nhas waves and ripples and makes picturesque \n<a href=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/21017966/anatomy-of-a-dust-bunny\">dust</a> \n<a href=\"https://dailybunny.org/\">bunnies</a>, \nbut perhaps more importantly, it marks regions where \n<a href=\"https://stardate.org/astro-guide/interstellar-gas-and-dust\">interstellar gas</a> is dense enough to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse\">gravitationally contract</a> to form stars.\n\nIn the image center is a light cloud lit by \nneighboring stars that is home not only to a famous nebula, \nbut to a very young and massive famous star. \n\nBoth the star, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri\">T Tauri</a>, and the nebula, \n<a href=\"ap220210.html\">Hind's Variable Nebula</a>, \nare seen to vary dramatically in brightness -- \nbut not necessarily at the same time, adding to the mystery of this intriguing region.\n\n<a href=\"ap110326.html\">T Tauri</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star\">similar stars</a> \nare now generally recognized to be \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-sun/\">Sun</a>-like stars that are less than a few million years old \nand so still in the early stages of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">formation</a>.\n\nThe featured image spans about four \n<a href=\"https://lco.global/spacebook/sky/using-angles-describe-positions-and-apparent-sizes-objects/\">degrees</a> not far from the \n<a href=\"ap221205.html\">Pleiades</a> star cluster, \nwhile the featured dust field lies about 400 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-years</a> away.",
