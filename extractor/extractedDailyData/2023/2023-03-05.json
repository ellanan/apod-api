  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those two bright spots?\n\nPlanets. \n\nA few days ago, the two brightest planets in the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/home/\">night sky</a> passed within a single degree of each other in what is termed a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)\">conjunction</a>.\n\nVisible just after sunset in much of the world, \nthe two bright spots were \n<a href=\"ap220828.html\">Jupiter</a> (left) and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">Venus</a> (right). \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=184295934298992&amp;set=a.183908144337771\">featured image</a> was taken near closest approach from \n<a href=\"https://beachoo.com/beach/cirica\">Cirica</a>, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/CSbL2-slXuA\">Sicily</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>.\n\nThe week before, Venus was rising higher in the \n<a href=\"ap230102.html\">sunset sky</a> to meet the dropping Jupiter.\n\nNow they have \n<a href=\"ap230304.html\">switched places</a>.\n\nOf course, <a href=\"ap220306.html\">Venus</a> remains much closer to both the \n<a href=\"ap230222.html\">Sun</a> and the Earth than Jupiter -- \nthe apparent closeness between the planets in the sky of \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a> was only \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/angles.html\">angular</a>. \n\nYou can still \n<a href=\"ap151108.html\">see</a> the \n<a href=\"https://bouncymustard.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-funny-two-cats-are-better-than-one.jpg\">popular pair</a> for an hour or so after sunset this month although they continue to separate, and \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/in-depth/\">Jupiter</a> continues to set earlier each night.",
