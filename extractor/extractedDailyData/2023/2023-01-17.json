  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are there oxygen-emitting arcs near the direction of the Andromeda galaxy?\n\nNo one is sure.\n\nThe gas arcs, <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/1d8ivk/\">shown</a> in blue, were \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/TEMXss1Qo4E\">discovered</a> and first \n<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/acaf7e/meta\">confirmed</a> by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_astronomy\">amateur astronomers</a> \njust last year.\n\nThe two main origin hypotheses for the arcs are that they really are close to Andromeda \n(<a href=\"ap220711.html\">M31</a>), \nor that they are just coincidentally placed \n<a href=\"ap010113.html\">gas filaments</a> in our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way galaxy</a>. \n\nAdding to \n<a href=\"https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1145793716/photo/portrait-of-a-cat-against-white-background.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=gxSI9GrKzLiHgaIq6M38hb5-PtzHHMctcLBJSLmiEeM=\">the mystery</a> is that arcs were not seen in previous \n<a href=\"ap221024.html\">deep images of M31</a> \ntaken primarily in light emitted by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/index.html\">hydrogen</a>, \nand that other, \n<a href=\"ap110210.html\">more distant galaxies</a> \nhave not been generally noted as showing similar <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/testing_and_analysis/oxygen_systems/index.html\">oxygen</a>-emitting structures. \n\nDedicated amateurs using commercial telescopes made \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CnMZGfwO639/\">this discovery</a> because, in part, professional telescopes usually \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-recently-discovered-gas-cloud-near-andromeda-stumps-astronomers/\">investigate</a> \nangularly small patches of the night sky, \nwhereas these arcs span several times the \n<a href=\"https://lco.global/spacebook/sky/using-angles-describe-positions-and-apparent-sizes-objects/\">angular size</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap200322.html\">full moon</a>. \n\nFuture observations -- both in light emitted by oxygen and by \n<a href=\"ap230108.html\">other elements</a> -- are sure to follow.",
