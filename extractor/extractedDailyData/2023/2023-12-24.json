  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that in the center? \n\nLike a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/lWOySU_hAz0\">butterfly</a>, a \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html\">white dwarf star</a> begins its life by casting off a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa#Cocoon\">cocoon</a> \nof gas that enclosed its former self. \n\nIn this analogy, however, the \n<a href=\"ap231211.html\">Sun</a> would be a \n<a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2019/05/are-caterpillars-insects/\">caterpillar</a> and the ejected shell of gas would become the \n<a href=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-CE236_DOG_DV_20130211182422.jpg\">prettiest</a> cocoon of all. \n\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/opo9935e/\">featured cocoon</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> designated \n<a href=\"ap070215.html\">NGC 2440</a> contains one of the \n<a href=\"ap951130.html\">hottest white dwarf stars</a> known. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap000910.html\">white dwarf</a> \ncan be seen as the bright orange dot near the image center. \n\nOur <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> \nwill eventually become a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf\">white dwarf</a> \nbutterfly, but not for \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2022/08/The_Sun_s_future\">another 5 billion years</a>.",
