  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are there so many flat rocks on Mars?\n\nSome views of plains and hills on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/\">Mars</a> show many rocks that are unusually flat when compared to rocks on Earth.\n\nOne reason for this is a process that is common to both Mars and Earth: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion\">erosion</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/#otp_atmosphere\">carbon-dioxide</a> \n<a href=\"ap150303.html\">wind on Mars</a> can act like \nsandpaper when it blows around gritty \n<a href=\"ap190924.html\">Martian sand</a>.\n\nThis sand can create differential erosion, smoothing over \n<a href=\"https://geology.com/stories/13/rocks-on-mars/\">some rocks</a>, while wearing down the tops of other long-exposed stones. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nev-t/52814100597/in/pool-apods/\">featured image</a> capturing \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/27373/n_r000_3783_edr100cylasb2208_autolm1/\">several hills</a> covered with flat-topped rocks was taken last month by NASA's  \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity Rover</a> on Mars.\n\nThis robotic rover has now been rolling across Mars for ten years and has helped \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/results/\">uncover many details</a> of the wet and \n<a href=\"ap011017.html\">windy</a> past of Earth's planetary neighbor. \n\nAfter taking this and \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/27294/curiositys-360-degree-view-of-marker-band-valley/\">other images</a>, Curiosity carefully navigated \nstones and slippery sand to climb up \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/?month=4&amp;year=2023\">Marker Band Valley</a>.",
