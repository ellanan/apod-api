  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt moved across the surface of \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/#red_planet/2\">Mars</a> -- what was it?\n\nA <a href=\"ap120413.html\">dust devil</a>.\n\nSuch spinning columns of rising air are heated by the warm surface \nand are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_devil\">also common</a> in warm and dry areas on \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">planet Earth</a>. \n\nTypically lasting only a few minutes, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HYvIsarm9_0\">dust devils</a> \nbecome visible as they pick up loose red-colored dust, \nleaving the darker and heavier sand beneath intact. \n\nDust devils not only look cool -- they can leave \n<a href=\"ap031230.html\">visible trails</a>, and have been credited with unexpected \n<a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/mars-dust-devil-whisks-spirit-clean/\">cleanings of the surfaces of solar panels</a>.\n\nThe images in the \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/192429429@N06/53236541159/in/pool-apods/\">featured</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Interframe_motion_interpolation.webm\">AI-interpolated video</a> were captured in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7IDwMTcpv8w\">early August</a> by the \nPerseverance rover currently \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/science/\">searching</a> for signs of ancient life in Jezero Crater.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/192429429@N06/53236541159/in/pool-apods/\">six-second time-lapse video</a> \nencapsulates a real duration of just over one minute. \n\nVisible in the distance, the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4aswtt6Cobo\">spinning dust devil</a> was estimated to be passing\nby at about 20 kilometers per hour and extend up about 2 kilometers high.",
