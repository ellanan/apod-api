  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe surface of our Sun is constantly changing. \n\nSome years it is quiet, showing relatively few sunspots and active regions.\n\nOther years it is churning, showing many \n<a href=\"ap230517.html\">sunspot</a>s and throwing frequent \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-coronal-mass-ejection-or-cme/\">Coronal Mass Ejections</a> (CMEs) and \n<a href=\"ap180902.html\">flare</a>s.\n\nReacting to \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/\">magnetism</a>, our Sun's surface goes through periods of relative calm, \ncalled Solar Minimum and relative unrest, called Solar Maximum, every 11 years.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13714/\">featured video</a> shows on the left a month in late 2019 when the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/sun/\">Sun</a> was near \n<a href=\"ap191028.html\">Solar Minimum</a>, while on the \nright a month in 2014 when near \n<a href=\"ap071203.html\">Solar Maximum</a>. \n\nThe video was taken by NASA's \n<a href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Solar Dynamic Observatory</a> in far \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/\">ultraviolet</a> light.\n\nOur <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Sun</a> is progressing again toward \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/solar-cycle-25-is-here-nasa-noaa-scientists-explain-what-that-means/\">Solar Maximum</a> in 2025, but displaying even now a surface with a \n<a href=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/7140633/pexels-photo-7140633.jpeg\">surprisingly</a> high amount of activity.",
