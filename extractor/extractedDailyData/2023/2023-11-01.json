  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nPart of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> disappeared earlier this month, but few people were worried.\n\nThe missing part, which included the center from some locations, \njust went behind the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a> \nin what is known as an \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when\">annular solar eclipse</a>. \n\nFeatured here is an \n<a href=\"ap190122.html\">eclipse sequence</a> taken as the \nMoon was overtaking the rising Sun in the sky.\n\nThe foreground hill is \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/D0GxV5zpagQ\">Factory Butte</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nThe rays flaring out from the Sun are not real -- \nthey result from camera \n<a href=\"ap010415.html\">aperture diffraction</a> and are known as \n<a href=\"https://www.blueskytraveler.com/how-to-create-sunstars-in-your-photos/\">sunstar</a>.\n\nThe Moon is <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/3d/bc/3d3dbcf8a4f9dbee8fc608c8d62dbb8c.jpg\">real</a>, but appears only in silhouette in this \n<a href=\"ap230924.html\">ring-of-fire eclipse</a>.\n\nAs stunning as this \n<a href=\"ap231005.html\">eclipse sequence</a> is, \nit was considered just practice by the astrophotographer. \n\nThe reason? She hopes to use this experience to better photograph the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\">total solar eclipse</a> that will occur over \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a> \non April 8, 2024.",
