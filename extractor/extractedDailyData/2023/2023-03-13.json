  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat lies at the end of a rainbow?\n\nSomething different for everyone. \n\nFor the photographer taking this picture, for example, one \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/PSZxmZmBfnU\">end of the rainbow</a> ended at a tree.\n\nOthers nearby, though, would likely see the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow\">rainbow</a> end somewhere else. \n\nThe reason is because a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xkDhQGXqwCM\">rainbow</a>'s \nposition depends on the observer. \n\nThe center of a rainbow always appears in the direction \n<a href=\"ap190624.html\">opposite the Sun</a>, \nbut that direction lines up differently on the \nhorizon from different locations.\n\nThis <a href=\"ap221227.html\">rainbow's arc</a> \nindicates that its center is about 40 \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/degrees.html\">degrees</a> to the left and slightly below the horizon, while the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/by-the-numbers/\">Sun</a> is well behind the camera and just above the horizon.\n\n<a href=\"https://atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/primrays.htm\">Reflections and refractions</a> of sunlight from raindrops in a \n<a href=\"ap170226.html\">distant storm</a> in the direction of the \n<a href=\"https://atoptics.co.uk/bows.htm\">rainbow</a> \nare what causes the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow#/media/File:Rainbow1.svg\">colorful</a> bands of light.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CnFDoMGJCBn/\">This single exposure image</a> was captured in early January \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HTTFCm5ueA8?t=39\">near Knight's Ferry</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.",
