  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis dance is to the death. \n\nAs these two large galaxies duel, a \n<a href=\"ap140715.html\">cosmic bridge</a> of stars, gas, and dust currently stretches over 75,000 <a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light-years</a> and joins them. \n\nThe bridge itself is strong evidence\nthat these two immense star systems have\n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">passed close</a> to each other\nand experienced \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcDtJ_-jdMw\">violent tides</a> induced by mutual gravity.\n\nAs further evidence, the face-on spiral galaxy on\nthe right, also known as NGC 3808A,\nexhibits many young blue star clusters produced in a burst\nof star formation.\n\nThe twisted edge-on spiral on the left (NGC 3808B) seems to be wrapped\nin the material <a href=\"ap061111.html\">bridging the galaxies</a> and\nsurrounded by a curious\n<a href=\"ap141108.html\">polar ring</a>.\n\nTogether, the system is known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arp_87\">Arp 87</a>.\n\nWhile such interactions are drawn out over billions of years, repeated\n<a href=\"ap120717.html\">close passages</a> \nwill ultimately create one merged galaxy.\n\nAlthough\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..623T/abstract\">this scenario</a> \ndoes look unusual, galactic mergers are thought\nto be common, with Arp 87 representing a stage in\n<a href=\"http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jhibbard/MergeSeq/mergeseq.html\">this\ninevitable process</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2007/news-2007-36.html\">Arp 87 dancing pair</a> are\nabout 300 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-years</a>\ndistant toward the constellation of the Lion \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)\">Leo</a>).\n\nThe <a href=\"ap190329.html\">prominent edge-on spiral</a> \ngalaxy at the far left\nappears to be a more distant background galaxy and\nnot involved in the on-going merger.",
