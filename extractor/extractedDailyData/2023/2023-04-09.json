  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhere is the center of the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1997/11/475-Image.html\">Egg Nebula</a>?\n\nEmerging from a cosmic egg,\nthe star in the center of the Egg Nebula is casting away \nshells of gas and dust as it slowly transforms itself into a \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978PASA....3..220B/abstract\">white dwarf</a> star. \n\nThe Egg Nebula is a rapidly evolving \npre-\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> \nspanning about one light year.\n\nIt lies some 3,000 light-years away toward the northern constellation\nCygnus.\n\nThick dust blocks the center star from view, \nwhile the dust shells farther out reflect light from this star.  \n\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4580\">Light vibrating</a>\nin the plane defined by each dust grain, the central star,\nand the observer is \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/polar.html\">preferentially reflected</a>,\ncausing an effect known as polarization.  \n\nMeasuring the orientation of the polarized light \nfor the Egg Nebula gives clues to location of the hidden source.  \n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2003/09/1305-Image.html\">Taken by Hubble's</a>\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys in 2002,\nthis image is rendered in artificial \"Easter-Egg\" colors coded to \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1997/11/475-Image.html\">highlight</a>\nthe orientation of\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/stem-ed-resources/polarization-of-light.html\">polarization</a>.",
