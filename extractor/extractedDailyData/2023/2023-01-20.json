  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe two dominant galaxies near center\nare far far away, 12 million light-years distant\ntoward the northern constellation of the Great Bear.\n\nOn the right, with grand spiral arms and bright yellow core is\n<a href=\"ap190417.html\">spiral galaxy M81</a>.\n\nAlso known as Bode's galaxy, M81 spans some 100,000\nlight-years.\n\nOn the left is cigar-shaped \n<a href=\"ap190723.html\">irregular galaxy M82</a>.  \n\nThe pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years.\n\n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-11-astronomers-stellar-halo.html\">Gravity\nfrom each galaxy</a> has profoundly affected the other during\na series of cosmic close encounters.  \n\nTheir last go-round lasted about 100 million years and\nlikely raised density waves rippling around \nM81, resulting in the richness of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0seVq5ydqzk\">M81</a>'s\nspiral arms.  \n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2001/news-2001-08.html\">M82</a>\nwas left  with violent star forming regions and \ncolliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/m82/\">glows in X-rays</a>.  \n\nIn the next few billion years, their\ncontinuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/31may_andromeda/\">single galaxy will remain</a>.\n\nThis extragalactic scenario also includes other members of the interacting\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/m81.html\">M81 galaxy group</a>\nwith NGC 3077 below and right of the large spiral, and\nNGC 2976 at upper right in the frame.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CnSTIpuLZFV/\">Captured under dark night skies</a>\nin the Austrian Alps, the foreground of\nthe wide-field image is filled with integrated flux nebulae.\n\nThose faint, <a href=\"ap160428.html\">dusty interstellar clouds</a>\nreflect starlight above the plane of our own Milky Way galaxy.",
