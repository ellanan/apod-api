  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's not the big ring that's attracting the most attention.\n\nAlthough the big planet-forming ring around the star \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Cslrr2koNvU\">PDS 70</a> \nis clearly imaged and itself quite interesting.\n\nIt's also not the planet on the right, just inside the \n<a href=\"ap041019.html\">big disk</a>, that’s being talked about the most. \n\nAlthough the planet \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDS_70\">PDS 70</a>c \nis a newly formed and, interestingly, similar in size and mass to \n<a href=\"ap190908.html\">Jupiter</a>.\n\nIt's the fuzzy patch around the \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7414/pds-70-c/\">planet PDS 70c</a> that's \n<a href=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/animals-looking-through-the-window-201.jpg\">causing the commotion</a>.\n\nThat fuzzy patch is thought to be a \n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2111/\">dusty disk</a> that is now forming into moons -- \nand that had never been seen before.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso2111b/\">featured image</a> was taken in 2021 by the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array\">Atacama Large Millimeter Array</a> (ALMA) of 66 \n<a href=\"ap140526.html\">radio telescopes</a> in the high \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/o5JfmFSBDgE\">Atacama Desert</a> of northern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>. \n\nBased on ALMA data, \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916L...2B/abstract\">astronomers infer</a> that the moon-forming \nexoplanetary disk has a radius similar to our Earth's orbit, \nand may one day form three or so \n<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Luna#Proper_noun\">Luna</a>-sized moons -- \nnot very different from our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/the-galilean-satellites\">four</a>.",
