  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDid you see an aurora over the past two nights?\n\nMany people who don't live in Earth's far north did. \n\n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/index.php?title=aurora\">Reports of aurora</a> came in not only from northern locales in the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> as \n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=195526\">Alaska</a>, but as far south as \n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=195569\">Texas</a> and \n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=195547\">Arizona</a>.\n\nA huge auroral oval extended over \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\">Europe</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia\">Asia</a>, too.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Crb33XXIX7E/\">Pictured</a>, an impressively \n<a href=\"https://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/4D.html\">red aurora</a> was captured last night near the town of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1ceres,_Spain\">Cáceres</a> in central \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>.\n\nAuroras were also reported in \n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=195528\">parts</a> of southern Spain.\n\nThe auroras resulted from a strong \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/what-is-a-coronal-mass-ejection\">Coronal Mass Event</a> (CME) that occurred on the Sun a few days ago.\n\nParticles from the CME crossed the inner \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> before colliding with the Earth's \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere\">magnetosphere</a>. \n\nFrom there, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron\">electron</a>s and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton\">proton</a>s spiraled down the \nEarth's northern magnetic field lines and collided with \noxygen and nitrogen in \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, causing \n<a href=\"ap230419.html\">picturesque</a> auroral \nglows.\n\nOur unusually active Sun may provide future\n<a href=\"ap230122.html\">opportunities</a> to see the \n<a href=\"ap180621.html\">northern lights</a> in \n<a href=\"ap031113.html\">southern skies</a>.",
