  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nComet ZTF has a distinctive shape.\n\nThe now bright comet visiting the inner \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> has been showing not only a common \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/anatomy-of-a-comet.en.jpg\">dust tail</a>,\n<a href=\"ap210308.html\">ion tail</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/science/why-comets-are-green.html\">green gas</a> coma, but also an uncommonly distinctive \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitail\">antitail</a>.\n\nThe antitail does not actually lead the comet -- it is just that the head of the comet is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitail#/media/File:Anti-tail.jpg\">seen superposed</a> on part of the fanned-out and trailing dust tail. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/\">giant dirty snowball</a> \nthat is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2022_E3_(ZTF)\">Comet C/2022 E3</a> (ZTF) has now passed its closest to the \n<a href=\"ap230114.html\">Sun</a> and tomorrow will pass its closest to the Earth.\n\nThe main panel of the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn1tZRBoXSF/\">featured triple image</a> \nshows how Comet ZTF looked last week to the unaided eye under a dark and clear sky over \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pAWvXFfI2yo\">Cáceres</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>. \n\nThe top inset image shows how the comet looked through \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars\">binoculars</a>, \nwhile the lower inset shows how the comet looked through \n<a href=\"https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/galileo.html\">a small telescope</a>. \n\nThe comet is \n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/ephemeris.php?objtxt=CK22E030\">now visible</a> all night long from northern latitudes but will \n<a href=\"https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sad-cat-eyes-1.jpg\">surely fade</a> from easy observation during the next few weeks.",
