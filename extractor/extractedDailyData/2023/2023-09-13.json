  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nGalaxy NGC 4632 hides a secret from optical telescopes. \n\nIt is surrounded by a ring of cool \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> \ngas orbiting at 90 degrees to its spiral disk. \n\nSuch <a href=\"ap990510.html\">polar ring galaxies</a> \nhave previously been discovered using starlight. \n\nHowever, NGC 4632 is among the first in which a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio</a> \n<a href=\"https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-telescopes/\">telescope</a> survey revealed a polar ring. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dkMr-D2719w\">featured composite image</a> \ncombines this gas ring, observed with the highly sensitive \n<a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/atnf/askap-radio-telescope\">ASKAP telescope</a>, with optical data from the \n<a href=\"https://subarutelescope.org/\">Subaru telescope</a>. \n\nUsing <a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details/ARC-1992-AC89-0437-6\">virtual reality</a>, astronomers separated out the \ngas in the main disk of the galaxy from the ring, \nand the subtle color gradient traces its orbital motion. \n\nWhy do \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar-ring_galaxy\">polar rings</a> exist? \n\nThey could be material \n<a href=\"https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/dog-playing-tug.jpg\">pulled</a> from one galaxy as it \n<a href=\"ap190811.html\">gravitationally interacts</a> with a companion. \n\nOr hydrogen gas flows along the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-H3WzaewdY\">filaments of the cosmic web</a> and accretes into a ring around a galaxy, \nsome of which gravitationally contracts into stars.",
