  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt was one of the most energetic particles ever known to strike the Earth -- but where did it come from? \n\nDubbed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu_particle\">Amaterasu</a> after the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto\">Shinto</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu\">sun goddess</a>, this particle, as do all \n<a href=\"https://www.auger.org/outreach/cosmic-rays/cosmic-ray-mystery\">cosmic rays</a> that strike the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-atmospheric-layers-3/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, caused an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_(physics)\">air shower</a> \nof electrons, protons, and other \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle\">elementary particles</a> to spray down onto the Earth below.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-39535.html\">featured illustration</a>, a cosmic ray \n<a href=\"ap060814.html\">air shower</a> is pictured striking the \n<a href=\"http://www.telescopearray.org/index.php/about/telescope-array\">Telescope Array</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>, \nwhich recorded the \n<a href=\"https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/cosmic-ray-2023/\">Amaterasu event</a> in 2021 May. \n\nCosmic ray air showers are common enough that you likely have been in a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/j-BBzWlOai0\">particle spray</a> yourself, \nalthough you likely wouldn't have noticed. \n\nThe origin of this energetic particle, likely the \n<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsnuclei\">nucleus of an atom</a>, remains a \n<a href=\"https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg\">mystery</a> in two ways.\n\nFirst, it is \n<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5095\">not known</a> how any single particle or atomic nucleus can practically acquire \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle\">so much energy</a>, and second, attempts to trace the particle back to \nwhere it originated did not indicate any likely potential source.",
