  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could stand on exoplanet LHS 475 b, what might you see?\n\nNo one knows for sure but pictured here is an \n<a href=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ws8MosQggVDs2RuK8Rs2oH-1200-80.jpg\">interesting guess</a> made by an Earth-based \n<a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/technology/artificial-intelligence-ai\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) engine.\n\nThe existence of the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-exoplanets/en/\">exoplanet</a> was indicated in data taken by the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess\">TESS satellite</a> but \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-webb-confirms-its-first-exoplanet\">confirmed and further investigated</a> only this year by the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6cUe4oMk69E\">near-Earth Sun-orbiting</a> \nJames <a href=\"https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html\">Webb Space Telescope</a>.\n\nWhat is known for sure is that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHS_475\">LHS 475</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHS_475_b\">b</a> \nhas a mass very similar to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/\">our Earth</a> and closely orbits a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf\">small red star</a> about 40 light years away.\n\nThe featured \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00107-z\">AI</a>-illustrated guess depicts a plausibly \n<a href=\"ap221213.html\">rugged</a> Earth-like landscape replete with \n<a href=\"ap210303.html\">molten lava</a> and with the central red star rising in the distance.\n\nWebb data does not as yet reveal, however, whether \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.com/2023/01/webb-discovers-lhs-475-b-an-earth-sized-rocky-planet.html\">LHS 475 b</a> has an atmosphere.\n\nOne of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/science/index.html\">Webb’s science objectives</a> \nis to follow up previous discoveries of distant\n<a href=\"ap220814.html\">exoplanets</a> to better discern their potential for \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/search-for-life/can-we-find-life/\">developing life</a>.",
