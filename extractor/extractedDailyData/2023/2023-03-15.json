  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was a sky to show the kids.\n\nEarly this month the two brightest planets in the night sky, \n<a href=\"ap230306.html\">Jupiter and Venus</a>, appeared to \n<a href=\"ap230304.html\">converge</a>.\n\nAt their closest, the \n<a href=\"ap230305.html\">two planets</a> \nwere separated by only about the angular width of the \n<a href=\"ap211010.html\">full moon</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151108.html\">spectacle</a> occurred just after sunset and was seen and \nphotographed all across \n<a href=\"ap220809.html\">planet Earth</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CpSqcLYslKQ/\">displayed image</a> \nwas taken near to the time of closest approach from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltingen\">Wiltingen</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>, and features the astrophotographer, spouse, and their two children. \n\nOf course, <a href=\"ap220306.html\">Venus</a> remains much closer to both the \n<a href=\"ap230222.html\">Sun</a> and the Earth than Jupiter -- \nthe apparent closeness between the planets in the sky of \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a> was only \n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/angles.html\">angular</a>. \n\nJupiter and <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">Venus</a> have passed and now appear increasingly far apart.\n\nSimilar <a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/article.php?term=conjunction&amp;year=2023&amp;tz=0#table\">planetary convergence</a> opportunities will \n<a href=\"https://www.dogalize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/happy-cat.jpg\">eventually arise</a>. \n\nIn a few months, for example, \n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20230701_15_100\">Mars and Venus</a> \nwill appear to congregate just as the Sun sets.",
