  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt seemed like the sky exploded.\n\nThe original idea was to photograph an \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/\">aurora</a> over a waterfall.\n\nAfter waiting for hours under opaque \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-are-clouds-58.html\">clouds</a>, though, hope was running out.\n\nOthers left.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, the clouds moved away.\n\nSuddenly, \n<a href=\"https://annex.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/happen.html\">particles</a> from a large solar magnetic storm were visible impacting the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's upper atmosphere</a> with full effect.\n\nThe night sky filled with \n<a href=\"ap170306.html\">colors</a> and motion in a \n<a href=\"https://www.petsworld.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Happy_Cat_Smiling.jpg\">thrilling</a> auroral display. \n\nStruggling to steady the camera from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rKUipxR3bDc\">high Earthly winds</a>, \nthe 34 exposures that compose the featured image were taken. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cto7pd9O_oD/\">resulting featured composite image</a> \nshows the photogenic Godafoss (Goðafoss) waterfall in northern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a> in front of a very \n<a href=\"ap130517.html\">active aurora</a> in late February.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap190526.html\">solar surface explosion</a> \nthat expelled the energetic particles occurred a \n<a href=\"https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?day=25&amp;month=02&amp;year=2023&amp;view=view\">few days before</a>. \n\nOur Sun is showing an impressive amount of \n<a href=\"ap141022.html\">surface activity</a> as it approaches \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum\">solar maximum</a>, \nindicating that more impressive auroras are likely to appear in Earth's \n<a href=\"http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211.fall2000.web.projects/Christina%20Shaw/WhereCanSee.html\">northern and southern sky</a> over the next few years.",
