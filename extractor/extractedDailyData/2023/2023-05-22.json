  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA nearby star has exploded and humanity's telescopes are turning to monitor it. \n\nThe supernova, dubbed \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2023ixf\">SN 2023ixf</a>, was discovered by Japanese astronomer \n<a href=\"https://www.smallstepstospace.com/content/2014/3/6/amateur-astronomer-koichi-itagaki-improves-supernova-research\">Koichi Itagaki</a> \nthree days ago and subsequently located on automated images from the \n<a href=\"https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/\">Zwicky Transient Facility</a> \ntwo days earlier. \n\nSN 2023ixf occurred in the photogenic \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_Galaxy\">Pinwheel Galaxy M101</a>, which, being only about 21 million light years away, makes it the closest supernova seen in the past five years, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82#2014_supernova\">second closest</a> in the past 10 years, and the \n<a href=\"ap110826.html\">second supernova</a> found \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_Galaxy#Supernovae_and_luminous_red_nova\">in M101</a> in the past 15 years. \n\nRapid follow up observations already indicate that SN 2023ixf is a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova\">Type II supernova</a>, an explosion that occurs after a \nmassive star runs out of nuclear fuel and collapses. \n\nThe featured image shows \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=m101\">home spiral galaxy</a> two days ago with the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/\">supernova</a> \nhighlighted, while the roll-over image shows the same galaxy a month before.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.wis-tns.org/astronotes/astronote/2023-119\">SN 2023ixf</a> will likely brighten and remain visible to telescopes for months. \n\nStudying such a close and young \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/t/Type+II+Supernova\">Type II supernova</a> may yield \n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/theverybesttop10.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Top-10-Best-Images-of-Surprised-Cats-8.jpeg\">new clues</a> about \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">massive stars and how they explode</a>.",
