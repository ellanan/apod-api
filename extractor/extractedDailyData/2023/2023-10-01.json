  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA good place to see a ring-of-fire eclipse, it seemed, would be from a desert.\n\nIn a desert, there should be relatively few obscuring clouds and trees. \n\nTherefore late December of 2019, a group of photographers traveled to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates\">United Arab Emirates</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali\">Rub al-Khali</a>, \nthe largest continuous sand desert in world, \nto capture clear images of an \n<a href=\"ap191228.html\">unusual eclipse</a> that would be passing over. \n\nA <a href=\"ap170301.html\">ring-of-fire eclipse</a> is an \nannular eclipse that occurs when \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> \nis far enough away on its elliptical orbit around \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a> \nso that it appears too small, angularly, to cover \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">the entire Sun</a>.\n\nAt the maximum of an \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question6.html\">annular eclipse</a>, the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2019\">This particular eclipse</a>, they knew, would peak \n<a href=\"ap191227.html\">soon after sunrise</a>. \n\nAfter <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2313450158759190&amp;type=3\">seeking out</a> such a dry and barren place, it turned out that some of the most \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/APOD.Sky/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2313450158759190\">interesting eclipse images</a> \nactually included \n<a href=\"ap181230.html\">a tree in the foreground</a>, because, in addition to the \n<a href=\"ap160119.html\">sand dune</a>s, \nthe tree gave the surreal background a contrasting sense of normalcy, scale, and \n<a href=\"ap170611.html\">texture</a>. \n\nOn Saturday, October 14, a new \n<a href=\"ap030605.html\">ring of fire</a> will be visible \nthrough clear skies from a thin swath crossing both \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#/media/File:Americas_(orthographic_projection).svg\">North and South America</a>.",
