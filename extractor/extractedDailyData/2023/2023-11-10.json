  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"ap230609.html\">Dominated by dark matter</a>,\nmassive cluster of galaxies Abell 2744 is known to some as\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-107\">Pandora's Cluster</a>.\n\nIt lies 3.5 billion light-years away toward the constellation Sculptor.\n\nUsing the galaxy cluster's enormous mass as a gravitational lens\nto warp spacetime and magnify even more distant objects\ndirectly behind it, astronomers\nhave found a background galaxy, UHZ1, at a\nremarkable\n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">redshift</a> of\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02750\">Z=10.1</a>.\n\nThat puts UHZ1 far beyond Abell 2744,\nat a distance of 13.2 billion light-years, seen when\nour universe was about 3 percent of its current age.\n\n<a href=\"https://chandra.si.edu/photo/2023/uhz1/\">UHZ1 is identified in\nthe insets</a>\nof this composited image combining X-rays (purple hues) from the \nspacebased Chandra X-ray Observatory and\ninfrared light from the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nThe X-ray emission from UHZ1 detected in the Chandra data is\nthe telltale signature of a growing supermassive black hole\nat the center of the ultra high redshift galaxy.  \n\nThat makes UHZ1's growing black hole the most\ndistant black hole ever detected in X-rays,\na result that now hints at how and when the first supermassive\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15458\">black holes in the universe formed</a>.",
