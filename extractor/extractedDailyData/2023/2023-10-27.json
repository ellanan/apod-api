  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nHistory's second known periodic comet is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke\">Comet Encke (2P/Encke)</a>.\n\nAs it swings through the inner\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/2p-encke/\">Solar System, Encke's</a>\norbit takes it from an aphelion, its greatest distance from the Sun,\ninside the orbit of Jupiter to a\nperihelion just inside the orbit of Mercury.\n\nReturning to its perihelion every 3.3 years, Encke has the shortest\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numbered_comets\">period of the Solar System's\nmajor comets</a>.\n\nComet Encke is also associated with\n(<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...605A..68S/abstract\">at least</a>)\ntwo annual meteor showers on\nplanet Earth, the\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/taurid-meteors-all-you-need-to-know/\">North and South Taurids</a>.\n\nBoth showers are active in late October and early November.\n\nTheir two separate radiants lie near bright star Aldebaran in the head-strong\nconstellation Taurus.\n\nA faint comet, Encke was captured in\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/jurom7/C/\">this telescopic field of view</a>\nimaged on the morning of August 24.\n\nThen, Encke's pretty greenish coma was close on the sky to \nthe young, embedded star cluster and light-years long,\n<a href=\"ap200618.html\">tadpole-shaped</a>\nstar-forming clouds in emission nebula IC 410.\n\n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/encke-info\">Now near bright star Spica</a>\nin Virgo Comet Encke passed its 2023 perihelion only five days ago,\non October 22.",
