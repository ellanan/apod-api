  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/pdco/index.html\">On the first planetary defense</a>\ntest mission from planet Earth,\nthe DART spacecraft captured this close-up on 26 September 2022,\nthree seconds before\n<a href=\"ap220929.html\">slamming</a> into the\nsurface of asteroid moonlet Dimorphos.\n\nThe spacecraft's outline with two long solar panels\nis traced at its projected\npoint of impact between two boulders.\n\nThe larger boulder is about 6.5 meters across.\n\nWhile the DART\n(<a href=\"https://dart.jhuapl.edu/\">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>)\nspacecraft had a mass of some 570 kilograms,\nthe estimated mass of Dimorphos,\nthe smaller member of a near-Earth binary asteroid system,\nwas about 5 <i>billion</i> kilograms.\n\nThe direct kinetic impact of the spacecraft measurably\naltered the speed of Dimorphos by a fraction of a percent,\nreducing its 12 hour\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02077\">orbital period</a> around its\nlarger companion\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/didymos/in-depth/\">asteroid 65803 Didymos</a>\nby about 33 minutes.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-dart-data-validates-kinetic-impact-as-planetary-defense-method\">Beyond successfully demonstrating</a>\na technique to change\nan asteroid's orbit that can prevent future asteroid\nstrikes on planet Earth,\nthe planetary-scale impact experiment\n<a href=\"ap221005.html\">has given</a> the\n150-meter-sized Dimorphos a\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01700\">comet-like tail of material</a>.",
