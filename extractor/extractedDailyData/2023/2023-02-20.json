  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere is nothing like this ball of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nThis is surprising because, at first glance, this \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mhozsarac/52639407387/in/dateposted/\">featured image</a> by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> suggests that star cluster \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1850\">NGC 1850</a>'s \nsize and shape are reminiscent of the many \n<a href=\"ap230130.html\">ancient</a> globular \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\">star clusters</a> \nwhich roam our own \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_halo\">Milky Way Galaxy's halo</a>. \n\nBut NGC 1850's stars are all too young, making it a type of star cluster with \n<a href=\"https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/4b87f4d2c84a7197cf9141e2e2295c4b.jpg\">no known counterpart</a> in the Milky Way. \n\nMoreover, <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2001/25/1093-Image.html\">NGC 1850</a> is also a \n<a href=\"ap221122.html\">double star cluster</a>, with a second, compact cluster of stars visible here just to the right of the large cluster's center. \n\nStars in the large cluster are estimated to be 50 million years young, \nwhile stars in the compact cluster are younger still, with an age of about 4 million years. \n\nA mere 168,000 <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a> distant, NGC 1850 is located near the outskirts of the \n<a href=\"ap200523.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> galaxy. \n\nThe glowing gas filaments across the image left, like \n<a href=\"ap220113.html\">supernova remnants</a> in our own galaxy, \ntestify to violent \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/\">stellar explosions</a> \nand indicate that short-lived massive \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> have recently been present in the region.",
