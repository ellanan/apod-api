  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would make a moon look like a walnut? \n\nA strange ridge that circles \n<a href=\"ap200419.html\">Saturn</a>'s moon \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/iapetus/in-depth/\">Iapetus</a>'s equator, visible near the bottom of the \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06166\">featured image</a>, \nmakes it appear similar to a popular \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QF20_XWL2Vs\">edible nut</a>. \n\nThe origin of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_ridge_on_Iapetus\">the ridge</a> remains unknown, though, with hypotheses including ice that welled up from below, a ring that crashed down from above, \nand structure left over from its formation perhaps 100 million years ago.\n\nAlso strange is that about half of \n<a href=\"ap180603.html\">Iapetus</a> is so dark that it can \nnearly disappear when viewed from Earth, while \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon)#Two-tone_coloration\">the rest</a> is, reflectively, quite bright.\n\nObservations \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..170..125V/abstract\">show</a> that the degree of darkness of the terrain is strangely uniform, \nas if a dark coating was somehow recently applied to an ancient and highly cratered surface. \n\nLast, several large impact basins occur around \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon)\">Iapetus</a>, with a 400-kilometer wide crater visible near the image center, surrounded by \n<a href=\"ap970218.html\">deep cliffs</a> that drop sharply to the crater floor. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06166\">featured image</a> was taken by the Saturn-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> during a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6EE2rDEUB-U\">flyby of Iapetus</a> at the end of 2004.",
