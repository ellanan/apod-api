  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those dark streaks in this composite image of a solar eclipse?\n\nThey are reversed shadows of mountains at the edge of the Moon. \n\nThe center image, captured from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke5nVmMxIwY\">Xiamen</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>, \nhas the Moon's center directly in front of the Sun's center.\n\n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">The Moon</a>, though, was \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/sites/eclipse.aas.org/files/Total-Annular-TQ.jpg\">too far</a> from \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a> to completely block the entire Sun. \n\nLight that streamed around the edges of the Moon is called a  \n<a href=\"ap200615.html\">ring of fire</a>.\n\nImages at each end of the sequence show \n<a href=\"ap170301.html\">sunlight that streamed</a> through lunar valleys. \n\nAs the Moon moved further in front of the Sun, left to right, \nonly the higher peaks on the Moon's perimeter could block sunlight. \n\nTherefore, the dark streaks are projected, \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/69/ff/c4/69ffc42ba1c739e25ed76fcaa6555a0e.jpg\">distorted</a>, reversed, and magnified \n<a href=\"ap180507.html\">shadows of mountains</a> at the Moon's edge. \n\nBright areas are called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads\">Baily's Beads</a>.\n\nOnly people in a narrow swath across Earth's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Hemisphere\">Eastern Hemisphere</a> \nwere able to view this full annular solar eclipse in 2020.\n\nNext month, though, a narrow swath crossing \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas\">both North and South America</a>\nwill be exposed to the \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html\">next</a> \nannular solar eclipse.\n\nAnd next April, a \n<a href=\"ap170912.html\">total solar eclipse</a> will be visible across \nNorth America.",
