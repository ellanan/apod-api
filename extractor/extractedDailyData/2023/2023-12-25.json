  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSingle shots like this require planning. \n\nThe first step is to realize that such an amazing \n<a href=\"ap150624.html\">triple-alignment</a> actually takes place.\n\nThe second step is to find the best location to photograph it.\n\nBut it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- \nand when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest.\n\nFive times over six years the photographer tried and found \n<a href=\"ap210613.html\">bad weather</a>. \n\nFinally, just ten days ago, the \n<a href=\"https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/weather-and-climate/\">weather</a> \nwas perfect, and a photographic dream was realized.\n\nTaken in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/oT5LB8wMNHI\">Piemonte</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>, \nthe cathedral in the foreground is the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Superga\">Basilica of Superga</a>, \nthe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Viso#/media/File:Monviso_-_panoramica_cresta_da_Ostanetta.jpg\">mountain</a> in the middle is \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ViA0MrOkv_Y\">Monviso</a>, and, well, \n<a href=\"https://post.bark.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/u4nf59H.png\">you know</a> which moon is in the background.\n\nHere, even though the \n<a href=\"ap200322.html\">setting Moon</a> was captured in a crescent \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/\">phase</a>, \nthe exposure was long enough for doubly reflected \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_(astronomy)\">Earthlight</a>, \ncalled the \n<a href=\"ap190926.html\">da Vinci glow</a>, to illuminate the entire top of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a>.",
