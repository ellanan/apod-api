  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSome 4 billion light-years away, massive galaxy cluster Abell 370\nis captured in this sharp\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2017/20/4024-Image.html\">Hubble Space Telescope snapshot</a>.\n\nThe cluster of galaxies only\nappears to be dominated by two giant elliptical galaxies\nand infested with faint arcs.\n\nIn reality, the fainter, scattered bluish arcs, along with the\n<a href=\"ap160828.html\">dramatic dragon arc</a>\nbelow and left of center, are images of galaxies that lie\nfar beyond Abell 370.\n\nAbout twice as distant, their otherwise undetected light is\nmagnified and distorted by the cluster's enormous gravitational mass,\noverwhelmingly dominated by unseen\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Galaxy_clusters\">dark matter</a>.\n\nProviding a\n<a href=\"http://webbtelescope.org/\">tantalizing glimpse</a>\nof galaxies in the early universe, the effect is known as gravitational\n<a href=\"ap151127.html\">lensing</a>.\n\nA consequence of warped\n<a href=\"http://www.black-holes.org/\">spacetime</a>, lensing was\npredicted by Einstein almost a century ago.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/videos/2017/20/953-Video.html\">Far beyond</a>\nthe spiky foreground Milky Way star at lower right,\nAbell 370 is seen toward the constellation Cetus, the Sea Monster.\n\nIt was the last of six galaxy clusters imaged in the\n<a href=\"https://frontierfields.org/\">Frontier Fields</a> project.",
