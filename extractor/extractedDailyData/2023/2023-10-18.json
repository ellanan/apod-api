  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's so big it is easy to miss.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"ap191031.html\">entire Veil Nebula</a> spans six times the diameter of the \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5048\">full moon</a>, \nbut is so dim you need \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars#/media/File:Binocularp.svg\">binoculars</a> to see it.\n\nThe nebula was created about \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_prehistory\">15,000 years ago</a> when a star in the \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/\">constellation</a> of the Swan \n(<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cygnus.html\">Cygnus</a>) exploded.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7zCPgdcdB5Q\">spectacular explosion</a> \nwould have \n<a href=\"ap211114.html\">appeared brighter</a> than even \n<a href=\"ap230915.html\">Venus</a> for a week - but there is \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/1a/62/d11a627b5fe41146b7afa313548c2119.jpg\">no known record</a> of it. \n\nPictured is the western edge of the still-expanding gas cloud.\n\nNotable gas filaments include the \n<a href=\"ap180408.html\">Witch's Broom Nebula</a> \non the upper left near the bright foreground star \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/52cyg.html\">52 Cygni</a>, \nand \n<a href=\"ap210727.html\">Fleming's Triangular Wisp</a> \n(formerly known as \n<a href=\"https://www.davidcortner.com/slowblog/20161113.php\">Pickering's Triangle</a>) running diagonally up the image middle. \n\nWhat is rarely imaged -- but seen in the featured long exposure across many color bands -- is the reflecting brown \n<a href=\"https://herscheltelescope.org.uk/science/infrared/dust/\">dust</a> that runs vertically up the image left, \ndust likely created in the cool atmospheres of massive \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/\">stars</a>.",
