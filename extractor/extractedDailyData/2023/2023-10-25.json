  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIn 60 seconds, this setting Sun will turn green.\n\nActually, the top of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">the Sun</a> \nalready appears not only green, but wavey -- along with all of its edges.\n\nThe Sun itself is unchanged -- both \n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">effects</a> are caused by \nlooking along hot and cold layers in <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nThe unusual color is known as a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash\">green flash</a> \nand occurs because these atmospheric layers not only shift background images but disperse colors into slightly different directions, like a \n<a href=\"https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/bending-light/latest/bending-light_en.html\">prism</a>. \n\nThe featured video was captured earlier this month off the coast of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/dB-qilyUX2Q\">Hawai</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii\">i</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a>.\n\nAfter <a href=\"https://i.cbc.ca/1.6583971.1663276172!/fileImage/httpImage/cat-boredom.jpg\">waiting</a> those 60 seconds, \nat the video's end, the upper part of \n<a href=\"ap230222.html\">the Sun</a> seems to hover alone in space, \nwhile turning not only \n<a href=\"ap230328.html\">green</a>, but \n<a href=\"ap110104.html\">blue</a>. \n\nThen suddenly, the Sun appears to shrink to nothing -- only to return tomorrow.",
