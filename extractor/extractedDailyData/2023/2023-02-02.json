  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/elvis/elnix.html\">The 1970s are</a>\nsometimes ignored by astronomers.\n\nFor example, this beautiful grouping of reflection nebulae\nin Orion - NGC 1977, NGC 1975, and NGC 1973 - is\nusually overlooked in favor of the substantial glow from the\nnearby stellar nursery better known as\n<a href=\"ap151229.html\">the Orion Nebula</a>.\n\nFound along Orion's sword just north\nof the bright Orion Nebula complex, these reflection nebulae are\nalso associated with Orion's giant molecular cloud about\n1,500 light-years away, but\nare dominated by the characteristic blue color of interstellar\n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/r/Reflection+Nebula\">dust reflecting</a>\nlight from hot young stars.\n\nIn this sharp color image\na portion of the Orion Nebula appears\nalong the bottom border with the cluster\n<a href=\"ap011228.html\">of reflection nebulae</a>\nat picture center.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...826L..15K/abstract\">NGC 1977</a>\nstretches across the field just below center,\nseparated from NGC 1973 (above right) and NGC 1975 (above left)\nby dark regions laced with faint red emission from\nhydrogen atoms.\n\nTaken together, the dark regions suggest the popular moniker, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh2-279\">Running Man Nebula</a>.\n\nAt the estimated distance of Orion's dusty molecular cloud this running man\nwould be about 15 light-years across.",
