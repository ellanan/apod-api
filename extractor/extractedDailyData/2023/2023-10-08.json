  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that in front of the Sun? \n\nThe closest object is an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_flying_machines\">airplane</a>, visible just below the Sun's center and caught purely by chance. \n\nNext out are numerous clouds in \n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, creating a series of darkened horizontal streaks.\n\nFarther out is \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Earth's Moon</a>, \nseen as the large dark circular bite on the upper right.\n\nJust above the airplane and just below the Sun's surface are sunspots.\n\nThe main sunspot group captured here, \n<a href=\"ap141025.html\">AR 2192</a>, was in 2014 \none of the largest ever recorded and had been \n<a href=\"ap141022.html\">crackling</a> and bursting with \nflares since it came around the edge of the Sun a week before.\n\nThis show of solar silhouettes was unfortunately short-lived.  \n\nWithin a few seconds the plane flew away.\n\nWithin a few minutes the clouds drifted off.\n\nWithin a few hours the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_October_23,_2014\">partial solar eclipse</a> of the Sun by the Moon was over.\n\nFortunately, when it comes to the Sun, even \n<a href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/1893/42812115870_c01b15d20b_b.jpg\">unexpecte</a>d  \na<a href=\"ap110115.html\">lignments</a> are \n<a href=\"ap130513.html\">surprisingly frequent</a>.\n\nPerhaps one will be imaged this Saturday when a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when/\">new partial solar eclipse</a> will be visible from much of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#/media/File:Americas_(orthographic_projection).svg\">North and South America</a>.",
