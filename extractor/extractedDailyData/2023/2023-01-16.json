  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOur Moon doesn't really look like this. \n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/in-depth/\">Earth's Moon</a>, Luna, doesn't naturally show this rich texture, \nand its colors are more subtle.\n\nBut this digital creation is based on reality. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ClT7OieMS3-/\">featured image</a> is a composite of multiple images and \n<a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/benson-cat-outfits-8.jpeg\">enhanced</a> to bring up real surface features. \n\nThe enhancements, for example, show more clearly craters that illustrate the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment\">tremendous bombardment</a> our Moon has been through during its \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/inside-and-out/overview/#otp_lunar_origins\">4.6-billion-year history</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare#/media/File:Moon_names.svg\">dark areas</a>, called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare\">maria</a>, \nhave fewer <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HTukFx17Ryg\">craters</a> and were once seas of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wiRdr5LzbwY\">molten lava</a>.\n\nAdditionally, the image \n<a href=\"ap210831.html\">colors</a>, although based on the \nmoon's real composition, are changed and exaggerated. \n\nHere, a blue hue indicates a region that is iron rich, \nwhile orange indicates a slight excess of aluminum. \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-moon/en/\">Moon</a> has shown the same side to the Earth for billions of years, \n<a href=\"ap140113.html\">modern technology</a> is allowing humanity to learn \n<a href=\"ap190717.html\">much more</a> about it -- and how it \n<a href=\"https://www.iop.org/explore-physics/moon/how-does-moon-affect-earth\">affects the Earth</a>.",
