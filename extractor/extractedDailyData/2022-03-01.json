  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are these two bands in the sky?\n\nThe more commonly seen band is the one on the right and is the central band of \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html\">our Milky Way galaxy</a>.\n\nOur <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> orbits in the disk of this \n<a href=\"ap170917.html\">spiral galaxy</a>, so that from inside, this disk \n<a href=\"ap170328.html\">appears as a band</a> \nof comparable brightness all the way around the sky.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap110710.html\">Milky Way band</a> \ncan also be seen all year -- if out \n<a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2017/02/09/light-pollution-changes-view-orion-constellation/\">away</a> from \n<a href=\"ap200408.html\">city lights</a>. \n\nThe less commonly seem band, on the left, is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light\">zodiacal light</a> -- \nsunlight reflected from dust orbiting the Sun in our Solar System. \n\n<a href=\"ap070925.html\">Zodiacal light</a> \nis brightest near the Sun and so is best seen just before sunrise or just after sunset. \n\nOn some evenings in the north, \nparticularly during the months of March and April, this ribbon of \n<a href=\"ap040825.html\">zodiacal light</a> \ncan appear quite prominent after sunset. \n\nIt was <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713..816N/abstract\">determined only this century</a> that \nzodiacal dust was mostly expelled by comets that have passed \n<a href=\"ap180226.html\">near Jupiter</a>. \n\nOnly on certain times of the year will the two bands be seen side by side, \nin parts of the sky, like this.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://twanight.org/gallery/dueling-lights/\">featured image</a>, including the \n<a href=\"ap220119.html\">Andromeda galaxy</a> and a meteor, \nwas captured in late January over a frozen lake in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/l0K7t1VcMtU\">Kanding</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan\">Sichuan</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>.",
