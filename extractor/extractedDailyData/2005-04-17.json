  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nRocks from space hit Earth every day.  \n\nThe larger the rock, though, the less often Earth is struck.  \n\nMany kilograms of space dust pitter to Earth daily. \nLarger bits appear initially as a bright <a href=\"\nhttp://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a>.  \n\nBaseball-sized rocks and ice-balls \nstreak through our atmosphere daily, \nmost evaporating quickly to nothing.  \n\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/\">Significant threats</a> do exist for rocks near \n100 meters in diameter, which \n\n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">strike the Earth</a> \nroughly every 1000 years.  \n\nAn object this size could cause significant \ntsunamis were it to strike an ocean, \npotentially devastating even distant shores. \n\nA collision with a <a href=\"ap040619.html\">Massive asteroid</a>, \nover 1 km across, <a href=\"ap980313.html\">is more rare</a>, \noccurring typically millions of years apart, but \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/doc/sentry.html\">could have truly global consequences</a>. \n\nMany asteroids remain \n<a href=\"http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/\">undiscovered</a>.  \n\nIn fact, one was discovered in 1998 as the long blue streak in the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1998/10/\">above archival image</a> taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/\">In 2002 June</a>,\nthe small 100-meter asteroid \n<a href=\"http://SkyandTelescope.com/news/current/article_641_1.asp\">2002 MN</a> was discovered only after it \nwhizzed by the Earth, passing well within the orbit of the Moon. \n \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2002mn.html\">2002 MN</a> passed closer than any asteroid since\n<a href=\"http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/media/press/1.htm\">1994 XM1</a>, but not as close as \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news149.html\">2004 MN4</a> will pass in 2029. \n\nA <a href=\"ap050308.html\">collision</a> with a large asteroid  \nwould not affect Earth's orbit so much as raise dust that would <a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/asteroid_impact_020626.html\">affect Earth's climate</a>.  \n\nOne likely result is a global extinction of many species of life, \npossibly dwarfing the ongoing \n<a href=\"http://www.ran.org/info_center/factsheets/03b.html\">extinction occurring now</a>.",
