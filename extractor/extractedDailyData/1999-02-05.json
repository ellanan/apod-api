  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThese are not false-color renderings of the latest observations of\n<a href=\"ap980424.html\">Saturn's magnificent rings</a>.\n\nInstead, the panels show a strikingly similar\nsystem on a much larger scale -\na ring around the young, Vega-like star,\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/03/b.html\">HR 4796A</a>, located about 200 light-years from Earth.\n\nProbably composed of dusty debris ground from colliding planetesimals,\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/03/content/9903c.jpg\">this ring is confined</a> to a zone less than 17 AU wide\n(1 AU equals the Earth-Sun distance) and\ngirdles the star at a radius  of about 70 AU,\nroughly twice the orbital radius of Neptune.\n\nIn analogy with the relationship\n<a href=\"http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/reference/abstracts/cuzzi1984_01.html\">of Saturn's rings and moons</a>,\nthis circumstellar ring could be held in place by\nforces due to planets - shepherding\nplanetary bodies or the gravitational influence of larger planets\norbiting closer to the parent star.\n\nIn any event, because the ring would not survive long without something\nto keep it there, astronomers consider its presence strong\n<a href=\"http://www.generation.net/~mariob/astro/xtrasol.htm\">evidence for unseen planetary bodies</a> around HR 4796A.\n\nThe top panels show\n<a href=\"http://nicmosis.as.arizona.edu:8000/AAS99/hr4796_postrev5.ps\">the false-color images</a> at two infrared wavelengths\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope's\n<a href=\"http://nicmos.as.arizona.edu/\">NICMOS instrument</a>,\nand the bottom panels trace the corresponding image contours.\n\nAt the center of each,\nthe overwhelming light of HR 4796A has been masked\nto reveal the fainter circumstellar ring.",
