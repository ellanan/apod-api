  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does this galaxy have so many big black holes?\n\nNo one is sure.\n\nWhat is sure is that\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_U42PDKstQ\">NGC 922</a> is a ring galaxy created by the collision of a large and small galaxy about \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic\">300 million years ago</a>.\n\nLike a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9QwiBFN9gI\">rock thrown into a pond</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap981219.html\">ancient collision</a> sent ripples of\nhigh density gas out from the impact point near the center that partly condensed into stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/45/\">Pictured above</a> is NGC 922 with its beautifully complex ring along the left side, as imaged recently by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nObservations of <a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2012/ngc922/\">NGC 922</a> with the \n<a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/about/\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>, however, show several glowing <a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2012/ngc922/ngc922_xray.jpg\">X-ray knots</a> that are likely large black holes.\n\nThe high number of <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/podcasts/ts/ts061212_hd.html\">massive black holes</a> was\n<a href=\"http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoIIOgmOeBjFjLOtah-cK6OkgRk5PiGfdUSPxvZA_TUXw5DiXL\">somewhat surprising</a> as the gas composition in \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atu4XOlXiMM\">NGC 922</a> -- rich in heavy elements -- should have discouraged almost anything so massive from forming.  \n\nResearch is sure to continue.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_922\">NGC 922</a>\nspans about 75,000 light years, lies about 150 million light years away, and can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of the furnace (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax\">Fornax</a>).",
