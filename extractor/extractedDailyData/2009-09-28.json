  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWater has been discovered on the surface of the Moon.  \n\nNo lakes have been found, but rather NASA's\n<a href=\"http://m3.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Moon Mineralogy Mapper</a> aboard India's new\n<a href=\"http://www.isro.org/chandrayaan/htmls/home.htm\">Chandrayaan-1</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs-04UvCcfQ\">lunar orbiter</a> radios back that parts of the Moon's surface absorb a very specific color of light identified previously only with water.\n\nCurrently, scientists are trying to fit this with other facts about the\n<a href=\"ap060216.html\">Moon</a> to figure out how much water is there, and even what form this water takes.  \n\nUnfortunately, even the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/moon20090924.html\">dampest scenarios</a> leave our moon dryer than the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert\">driest of Earth's deserts</a>.  \n\nA fascinating clue being debated is whether the\n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002118/\">water signal rises and falls</a> during a single lunar day.    \n\nIf true, the <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/24/water-on-the-moon-yup-its-real/\">signal might be</a> explainable by hydrogen flowing\n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">out from the Sun</a> and interacting with\n<a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/10/1019_051019_moon_oxygen.html\">oxygen in the lunar soil</a>.  \n\nThis could leave an extremely thin\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolayer\">monolayer</a>\nof water, perhaps only a few molecules thick.\n\nSome of the resulting water might subsequently evaporate away in bright sunlight.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark3.html\">Pictured above</a>, the area near a crater on the\n<a href=\"ap070225.html\">far side of the Moon</a> shows a\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090924-moon-water-reaction.html\">relatively high</a> abundance of water-carrying minerals in false-color blue.  \n\nNext week, the new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCROSS\">LCROSS satellite</a> will release an\n<a href=\"ap050705.html\">impactor</a> that will strike a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/news/2009-01-16_radar_first_look.html\">permanently shadowed crater</a>\nnear the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgM-StiCiI\">lunar south pole</a> to see if any hidden water or ice sprays free there.",
