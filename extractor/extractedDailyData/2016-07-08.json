  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAt the core of the\n<a href=\"ap150816.html\">Crab Nebula</a> lies a city-sized, magnetized\n<a href=\"ap030201.html\">neutron star</a> spinning 30 times a second.\n\nKnown as the Crab Pulsar, it's actually the rightmost of two bright\nstars, just below a central swirl in this\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/\n2016/26/\">stunning Hubble snapshot</a> of the nebula's core.\n\nSome three light-years across, the spectacular picture frames\nthe glowing gas, cavities and swirling filaments bathed in\nan eerie blue light.\n\nThe blue glow is visible radiation given off by electrons spiraling in a\nstrong magnetic field at nearly the speed of light.\n\nLike a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/chronicle/0201/vela.html\">cosmic\ndynamo</a> the <a href=\"ap010602.html\">pulsar powers</a> the\nemission from the nebula, driving a shock wave through surrounding\nmaterial and accelerating the spiraling electrons.\n\nWith more mass than\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=mass+of+the+sun\">the Sun</a>\nand the density of an <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/\nnuclear/nucuni.html\">atomic nucleus</a>,\nthe spinning pulsar is the collapsed core of a massive star\nthat exploded.\n\nThe Crab Nebula is the expanding remnant of the star's outer layers.\n\nThe supernova explosion was witnessed on planet Earth in\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/more/m001_sn.html\">the year 1054</a>.",
