  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe Milky Way doesn't look quite this colorful and bright to the eye,\nbut a rocket launch does.\n\nSo a separate deep exposure with a sensitive digital camera was used in\nthis composite skyscape to bring out our galaxy's central crowded\nstarfields and cosmic dust clouds.\n\nIn the scene from Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, a nine\nminute long exposure begun about 20 minutes after the\nMiky Way image recorded a rocket\n<a href=\"ap180704.html\">launch</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/47593269202/\">landing</a>.\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket, named for the Millennium Falcon of Star Wars fame,\nappropriately launched a\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/\nspacex-dragon-heads-to-space-station-with-nasa-science-cargo\">Dragon\nresupply ship</a> to the International Space Station\nin the early morning hours of May the 4th.\n\nThe plume and flare at the peak of the launch arc mark the rocket's\nfirst stage boost back burn.\n\nTwo shorter diagonal streaks are the rocket engines bringing the Falcon 9 stage\nback to an offshore landing on autonomous drone ship\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nList_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series\">Of course I Still Love You</a>.",
