  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nNGC 1748 cannot contain all the new stars it has formed.  \n\nThe young stars, the most massive of which are \n<a href=\"ap010207.html\">bright blue</a>, \nemit so much energy they are pushing out and dispersing the \ngas and \n<a href=\"http://eta.pha.jhu.edu/~danforth/superfit/superfit.html\">dust</a>\nthat comprise \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/2001/11/pr-photos.html\">this\nstar forming nebula</a>.  \n\nWithin only the past hundred thousand years, \nthese stars have altered the \n<a href=\"ap981118.html\">bubble-like shape</a> of the nebula and will \nlikely destroy the nebula over the next few million years.  \n\n<a href=\"http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103414\">Of\nparticular interest</a> is a bright region surrounded by a pink \nring of \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> and gas visible on the left of the \n<a href=\"http://hubble.esa.int/hubble/news/index.cfm?oid=26615\">above\nrecently released picture</a> by the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nThe center of this region is being evacuated by the \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">wind</a>\nof the brightest star in the nebula.  \n\nA lane of cooler dust connects NGC 1748 to a larger \nmore diffuse nebula seen on the right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/2001/11/fastfacts.html\">NGC\n1748</a> spans about 25 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> in diameter and can be found in our \ngalactic neighbor: the \n<a href=\"ap000222.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.",
