  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis color \"picture\" of\n<a href=\"ap000922.html\">globular star cluster M55</a>\nmay not look like any star cluster you've ever seen.\n\nStill, it shows a most fundamental view for students\nof stellar astronomy.\n\nIn the picture, a\n<a href=\"http://lodestar.phys.unm.edu/astro111/\nClusters/page2.htm\">Color Magnitude Diagram</a> (CMD),\nM55's individual stars\nare represented as dots whose\n<a href=\"ap961202.html\">color</a> indicates relative temperature,\nred (cool) to blue (hot).\n\nPosition in the CMD does not correspond to a star's location\nin the sky, though.\n\nInstead, it corresponds to a measured\n<a href=\"http://astrwww.cwru.edu/nassau/reference/\nphotometry.html\">astronomical color</a>,\n(B-V color) read off the bottom scale, and a\nbrightness in\n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/\nMAG.HTML\">magnitudes</a> (M) on the left hand scale.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/\ntmp.html\">temperature</a> for each star can also be found by\nreading the equivalent scale at the top, where\nthe Sun would have a temperature of 6,000\n<a href=\"http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/temps.htm\">kelvins</a> (K).\n\nBrightness relative to the Sun's luminosity (Sun = 1)\nis given on the scale at the right.\n\nThe globular cluster <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/\nscience/know_l2/stars.html\">stars</a> clearly fall into\ndistinct groups dramatically visible in this CMD.\n\nThe broad swath extending diagonally from the lower right is\nthe cluster's <i>main sequence</i>.\n\nA sharp turn toward the upper right hand corner follows the\n<i>red giant branch</i> while the\n<i>blue giants</i> are found grouped in the upper left.\n\nM55's stars were formed at the same time and at\nfirst were all located along the main sequence by mass,\nlower mass stars at the lower right.\n\nOver time, higher mass stars\n<a href=\"http://plabpc.csustan.edu/astro/stars/Stars.htm\">have\nevolved off</a> the main sequence\ninto red, then blue giants <a href=\"ap980415.html\">and beyond</a>.\n\nThe exact position of the sharp turn-off from the\nmain sequence to the red giant branch\n<a href=\"http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/~jka/Globular/\">measures</a>\nthe cluster's age.",
