  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nStaring up into the martian sky, the\n<a href=\"ap140125.html\">Opportunity rover</a>\ncaptured an image at 11:02 AM local mean\ntime nearly every 3rd sol, or martian day, for 1 martian year.\n\nOf course, the result is this\n<a href=\"ap061230.html\">martian analemma</a>,\na curve tracing the Sun's motion through the\nsky in the course of a year (668 sols)\n<a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/allison_02/\">on\nthe Red Planet</a>.\n\nSpanning Earth dates from July, 16, 2006 to June 2, 2008 the images\nare shown composited in\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/mars/\nmars-analemma-opportunity.html\">this zenith-centered, fisheye projection</a>.\n\nNorth is at the top surrounded by a\n<a href=\"http://marswatch.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/\nlyell_pan.html\">panoramic sky and landscape</a> made in\nlate 2007 from inside Victoria crater.\n\nThe tinted martian sky is blacked\nout around the analemma images to clearly show the Sun's positions.\n\n<a href=\"ap140320.html\">Unlike Earth's</a> figure-8-shaped analemma,\n<a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/allison_02/\">Mars'\nanalemma is pear-shaped</a>, because of its similar axial tilt\nbut more elliptical orbit.\n\nWhen Mars is farther from the Sun, the Sun progresses slowly in\nthe martian sky creating the pointy top of the curve.\n\nWhen close to the Sun and moving quickly, the apparent solar motion\nis stretched into the rounded bottom.\n\nFor several sols some of the frames are missing due to\n<a href=\"http://tamutimes.tamu.edu/2014/05/06/\nanother-word-for-mars-is-dust/\">rover operations and dust storms</a>.",
