  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would the sky look like a giant target?\n\nAirglow.\n\nFollowing a giant thunderstorm over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh\">Bangladesh</a> \nin late April, giant circular ripples of glowing air appeared over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet\">Tibet</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>, as \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdai/14845763849/\">pictured above</a>.\n\nThe unusual \n<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-bullseye-in-the-sky-over-texas/360705/\">pattern is created by</a> atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_484.html\">gravity waves</a>, waves of alternating air pressure that can grow with height as the air thins, in this case about 90 kilometers up. \n\nUnlike <a href=\"ap140714.html\">auroras</a> powered by collisions with energetic charged particles and seen at high latitudes, airglow is due to \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow2.htm\">chemiluminescence</a>, \nthe production of light in a chemical reaction. \n\nMore typically seen near the horizon, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow\">airglow</a> keeps the night sky from ever being completely dark.",
