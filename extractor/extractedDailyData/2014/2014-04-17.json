  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nRecorded on April 15th, this <a href=\"ap140416.html\">total\nlunar eclipse</a> sequence looks south down icy Waterton Lake from the\n<a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/waterton/index.aspx\">Waterton\nLakes National Park</a> in Alberta, Canada, planet Earth.\n\nThe most distant horizon includes peaks in\n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm\">Glacier National Park</a>,\nUSA.\n\nAn exposure every 10 minutes captured the Moon's position and\neclipse phase, as it arced, left to right, above the rugged skyline\nand Waterton town lights.\n\nIn fact, the sequence effectively measures the roughly 80 minute\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYPUfzzux3E\">duration\nof the total phase</a> of the\n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/LEprimer.html\">eclipse</a>.\n\nAround 270 BC, the Greek astronomer\n<a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/\nMathematicians/Aristarchus.html\">Aristarchus</a>\nalso measured the duration of lunar eclipses - though probably without\nthe benefit of <a href=\"http://itotd.com/articles/297/\nrevenge-of-the-analog-clock/\">digital clocks</a> and cameras.\n\nStill,\n<a href=\"http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Shipprc2.htm\">using geometry, he\ndevised</a> a simple and impressively accurate way to calculate\nthe Moon's distance, in terms of the radius of planet Earth,\nfrom the eclipse duration.\n\nThis modern eclipse sequence also tracks the successive positions of Mars,\nabove and right of the Moon, bright star Spica next to the reddened\nlunar disk, and Saturn to the left and below.",
