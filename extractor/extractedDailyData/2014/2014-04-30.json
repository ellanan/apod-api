  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you look closely, you will see something quite unusual about this setting Sun.\n\nThere are birds flying to the Sun's left, but that's \n<a href=\"ap090621.html\">not</a> \n<a href=\"ap120319.html\">so</a> \n<a href=\"ap110420.html\">unusual</a>.\n\nA dark sea covers the Sun's bottom, and dark clouds cover parts of the middle, but they are also \n<a href=\"ap130814.html\">not</a> \n<a href=\"ap120613.html\">very</a> \n<a href=\"ap091223.html\">unusual</a>.\n\nMore unusual is the occulted piece at the top right.\n\nAnd that's no occulting cloud -- \n<a href=\"ap131104.html\">that's</a> \n<a href=\"ap130513.html\">the</a> \n<a href=\"ap120520.html\">Moon</a>.\n\nYesterday the Moon moved in front of part of the Sun as visible from \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a>, and although many locations reported annoying clouds, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_29,_2014\">partially eclipsed</a> Sun would occasionally peek through as it set.\n\nThe above image was captured yesterday on the western horizon of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide,_South_Australia\">Adelaide</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia\">South Australia</a>.\n\nThe maximum eclipse was visible only from a small part of \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/antarctica/\">Antarctica</a> \nwhere the entire Moon could be seen covering the \nentire center of the Sun in what is known as an \n<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/annular-solar-eclipse.html\">annular eclipse</a>, leaving only a \n<a href=\"ap130511.html\">ring of fire</a> from the Sun \n<a href=\"http://cdn.cutestpaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/l-Double-trouble.jpg\">peeking out</a> around the edges.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_October_23,_2014\">next solar eclipse</a> will be another \n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">partial eclipse</a>, \nwill occur on 2014 October 23, and will be visible from most of \n<a href=\"http://www.ilike2learn.com/ilike2learn/northamerica.html\">North America</a> \nnear sunset.",
