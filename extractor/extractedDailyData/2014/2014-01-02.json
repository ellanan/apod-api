  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nCatching sight of\n<a href=\"http://mirrorproject.com/\">your reflection</a> in\na store window or shiny hubcap can be\nentertaining and occasionally even inspire a\n<a href=\"http://io9.com/5971306/\nwhy-do-mirrors-reverse-left-and-right-but-not-top-and-bottom\">thoughtful\nmoment</a>.\n\nSo consider <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/\nshuttle/sts-121/html/iss013e49644.html\">this reflective view</a>\nfrom 300 kilometers <a href=\"ap060713.html\">above planet Earth</a>.\n\nThe picture is actually a <a href=\"ap060121.html\">self-portrait</a>\ntaken by astronaut\nMichael Fossum on July 8, 2006 during a space walk or extravehicular\nactivity while the\n<a href=\"ap120419.html\">Discovery orbiter</a> was docked with the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/\nmultimedia/index.html\">International Space Station</a>.\n\nTurning his camera to snap a picture of his own helmet visor,\nhe also recorded the reflection of his fellow\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/\nindex.html\">mission</a> specialist,\nPiers Sellers, near picture center and one of the space station's\ngold-tinted solar power arrays arcing across the top.\n\nOf course, the horizon of\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">our fair planet</a>\nlies in background.",
