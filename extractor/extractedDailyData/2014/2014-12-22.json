  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's creating methane on Mars?\n\nRecent measurements from the robotic \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/overview/\">Curiosity rover</a> \ncurrently rolling across Mars indicate a \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4413\">surprising 10-fold increase</a> in atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> \nbetween measurements only months apart.\n\nLife is a major \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogenesis\">producer</a> of methane on Earth, and so speculation is rampant that some sort of \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal1/\">life</a> -- \npossibly microbial life -- is creating \n<a href=\"ap090119.html\">methane</a> beneath the surface of Mars.\n\nOther possibilities do exist, though, with a leading model being the sudden release of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars#Methane\">methane</a> \nproduced by the mixing of specific soil chemicals with underground water. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/117384/nasas-curiosity-rover-detects-methane-organics-on-mars/\">Proposed origins</a> of Martian methane are depicted in the \n<a href=\"http://astrobiology.gsfc.nasa.gov/research1.html\">featured illustration</a>.\n\nThe origin of Mars' methane is a very active area of research, \nwith missions like \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeK_V5JLCk\">Curiosity</a> and India's <a href=\"http://www.isro.gov.in/pslv-c25-mars-orbiter-mission\">Mars Orbiter Mission</a> searching for clues by measuring methane abundance changes and possible byproducts of different methane-producing processes.",
