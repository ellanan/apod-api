  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDespina is a tiny moon\n<a href=\"http://nineplanets.org/neptune.html\">of Neptune</a>.\n\nA mere 148 kilometers across,\n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/\nprofile.cfm?Object=Nep_Despina\">diminutive Despina</a> was\ndiscovered in 1989, in images from the\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/\nplanetary.html\">Voyager 2</a> spacecraft\ntaken during its encounter with the solar system's most\ndistant gas giant planet.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002035/\">But looking\nthrough the Voyager 2 data 20 years later</a>, amateur image processor\nand philosophy professor Ted Stryk discovered something no\none had recognized before -- images that show the shadow of Despina\nin transit across <a href=\"ap020922.html\">Neptune's blue cloud tops</a>.\n\nHis composite view of Despina and its shadow is composed of four\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html\">archival</a>\nframes taken on August 24, 1989, separated by nine minutes.\n\nDespina itself has been artificially brightened to make it easier\nto see.\n\nIn ancient Greek mythology,\n<a href=\"http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/\n100191sci-nasa-neptune.html\">Despina is</a> a daughter of Poseidon,\nthe Roman god Neptune.",
