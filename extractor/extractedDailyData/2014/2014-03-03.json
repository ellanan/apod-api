  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs Earth the only known world that can support life?\n\nIn an effort to find life-habitable worlds outside our \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System\">Solar System</a>,\nstars similar to our Sun are being monitored for slight light decreases that indicate \n<a href=\"ap120605.html\">eclipsing planets</a>.\n\nMany previously-unknown planets are being found, including \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/digital-press-kit-kepler-planet-bonanza/\">over 700 worlds recently</a> uncovered by NASA's Kepler satellite.\n\n<a href=\"http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/results\">Depicted above</a> in artist's illustrations are twelve extrasolar planets \nthat orbit in the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST101/habzone.html\">habitable zones</a> \nof their parent stars.\n\nThese <a href=\"http://exoplanets.org/\">exoplanets</a> \nhave the right temperature for water to be a liquid on their surfaces, \nand so water-based life on Earth might be able to survive on them. \n\nAlthough technology cannot yet detect resident life, finding \n<a href=\"http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog\">habitable exoplanets</a> is a step that helps humanity to <a href=\"http://www.herbblockfoundation.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/body_image/drupal_uploads/cartoons/4.19.1955albert_einstein_lived_here.jpg\">better understand</a> its place in the cosmos.",
