  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that in front of the Sun? \n\nThe closest object is an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_flying_machines\">airplane</a>, visible just below the Sun's center and caught purely by chance. \n\nNext out are numerous clouds in \n<a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, creating a series of darkened horizontal streaks.\n\nFarther out is Earth's Moon, seen as the large dark circular bite on the upper right.\n\nJust above the airplane and just below the Sun's surface are sunspots.\n\nThe main sunspot group captured here, \n<a href=\"ap141025.html\">AR 2192</a>, is one of the largest ever recorded and has been \n<a href=\"ap141022.html\">crackling</a> and bursting with \nflares since it came around the edge of the Sun early last week.\n\nTaken last Thursday, this show of solar silhouettes was unfortunately short-lived.  \n\nWithin a few seconds the plane flew away.\n\nWithin a few minutes the clouds drifted off.\n\nWithin a few hours the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_October_23,_2014\">partial solar eclipse</a> of the Sun by the Moon was over.\n\nOnly the sunspot group remains, but within a few more days even AR 2192 will disappear around the edge of the Sun.\n\nFortunately, when it comes to the Sun, even \n<a href=\"ap110115.html\">unexpected alignments</a> are \n<a href=\"ap130513.html\">surprisingly frequent</a>.",
