  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere should <i>Philae</i> land?\n\nAs ESA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Europe_s_comet_chaser\">spacecraft Rosetta</a> circles toward \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>, a decision must eventually be made as to where its mechanical lander should attempt to touch-down. \n\n<a href=\"ap140811.html\">Reaching the comet</a> earlier this month, \nRosetta is sending back detailed pictures of the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/08150814-finding-my-way-around-cg.html\">comet's unusual nucleus</a> from which a smooth landing site will be selected.   \n\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/08/Comet_on_7_August_b\">Pictured above</a>, near the image top, the head of the comet's nucleus shows rugged grooves, while near the image bottom, the body shows a patch-work of areas sometimes separated by \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/08/Rosetta_s_comet_in_3D\">jagged</a> hills. \n\nSome of the patch-work areas apparent on both the \n<a href=\"ap140807.html\">head and body</a> seem to have fields of relatively smooth terrain.\n\nIn the connecting area called the neck, however, visible across the image center, a relatively large swath of light-colored smooth terrain appears, punctuated occasionally by \n<a href=\"ap110619.html\">large boulders</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Rosetta</a> is scheduled to release \n<i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_(spacecraft)\">Philae</a></i> toward the \n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/1OF5OEK.jpg\">dark mountain-sized</a> \ncomet nucleus with an anticipated landing date in November.",
