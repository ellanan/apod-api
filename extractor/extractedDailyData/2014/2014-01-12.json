  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does the universe look like on small scales?\n\nOn large scales?  \n\n<a href=\"ap100725.html\">Humanity</a> is discovering that the universe is a very different place on every proportion that has been explored.\n\nFor example, so far as we know, every tiny proton is\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles\">exactly the same</a>, but every\n<a href=\"ap120107.html\">huge galaxy</a> is different.\n\nOn more familiar scales, a small glass table top to a human is a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage\">vast plane</a> of strange smoothness to a\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47CIdUld8eQ\">dust mite</a> -- possibly\n<a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/where-does-dust-come-from.htm\">speckled</a> with cell boulders.\n\nNot all scale lengths are\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKjF7OumYo\">well explored</a> -- what happens to the smallest mist droplets you sneeze, for example, is a topic of active research -- and possibly useful to know to help\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease\">stop the spread</a> of disease.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://htwins.net/scale2/\">above interactive flash animation</a>, a modern version of the classic video\n<a href=\"ap110201.html\">Powers of Ten</a>,\nis a new window to many of the\n<a href=\"ap100120.html\">known scales</a> of our universe.  \n\nBy moving the scroll bar across the bottom, you can explore a\n<a href=\"http://www.kruger-2-kalahari.com/images/the-long-the-tall-and-the-short-21373953.jpg\">diversity of sizes</a>, while clicking on different items will bring up descriptive information.",
