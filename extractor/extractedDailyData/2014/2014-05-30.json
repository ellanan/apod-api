  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe gorgeous, gaseous shroud of a dying sunlike star,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a>\nAbell 36 lies a mere 800 light-years away in the constellation of Virgo.\n\nAt that distance it spans over 1.5 light-years in\n<a href=\"http://skycenter.arizona.edu/gallery/Nebulae/Abell36\">this\nsharp telescopic view</a>.\n\nShrugging off its outer layers, the nebula's central star\nis contracting and becoming hotter, evolving towards a final\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/white_dwarfs.html\">white\ndwarf phase</a>.\n\nIn fact, in Abell 36, the central star is estimated to have a\nsurface temperature of over 73,000 K, compared to the Sun's present 6,000\n<a href=\"http://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/\nthermal/kelvin_temperature_scale.html\">K temperature</a>.\n\nAs a result, the intensely hot star is much brighter in\nultraviolet light, compared to its visual appearance here.\n\nThe invisible ultraviolet light ionizes hydrogen and oxygen atoms\nin the nebula and ultimately powers the beautiful visible light glow.",
