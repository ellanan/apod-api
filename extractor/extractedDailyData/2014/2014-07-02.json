  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSpiral galaxy NGC 4651 is a mere 62 million light-years distant,\ntoward the well-groomed northern constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices\">Coma\nBerenices</a>.\n\nAbout the size of our Milky Way, this island universe is seen to have\na faint umbrella-shaped structure that\nseems to extend (left) some 100 thousand light-years\nbeyond the bright galactic disk.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_ngc4651.html\">The\ngiant cosmic umbrella</a> is now known to be composed of\n<a href=\"ap080619.html\">tidal star streams</a> -\nextensive trails of stars\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/main.html\">gravitationally\nstripped</a>\nfrom a smaller satellite galaxy.\n\nThe small galaxy was eventually\ntorn apart in repeated encounters as\nit swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5511\">In fact</a>,\nthe picture insert zooms in on the smaller galaxy's remnant core,\nidentified in an extensive\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\nsmall_gabany-halo_streams_in_the_umbrella_galaxy-ngc4651.html\">exploration\nof the system</a>,\nusing data from the large Subaru and Keck telescopes\non Mauna Kea.\n\nWork begun by a remarkable collaboration of amateur and professional\nastronomers to image faint structures around bright galaxies\nsuggests that\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4860\">even in nearby galaxies</a>,\ntidal star streams are common markers of\nsuch galactic mergers.\n\nThe result is\n<a href=\"http://www.cosmotography.com/images/\ncosmological_modeling_overview.html\">explained by models</a>\nof galaxy formation that also apply to\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703601\">our own</a>\nMilky Way.",
