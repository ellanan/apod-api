  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat if a rock that looked like a jelly donut suddenly appeared on Mars?\n\nThat's just what happened in front of the \n<a href=\"http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html\">robotic Opportunity rover</a> currently exploring the red planet.\n\nThe unexpectedly placed rock, \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17761\">pictured above</a>, \nwas imaged recently by Opportunity after <i>not</i> \nappearing in other images taken as recently as twelve Martian days \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols\">sols</a>) before.\n\nGiven the intriguing mystery, the leading explanation is somewhat \n<a href=\"https://www.ipoll.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Dogs-and-Cats.jpg\">tame</a> -- the rock was recently scattered by one of the rover's tires.\n\nEven so, the rock's unusual light tones surrounding a red interior created interest in its \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_Mars\">composition</a> -- \nas well as causing it to be nicknamed \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_donut\">Jelly Donut</a>. \n\nA subsequent chemical \n<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/science/mysterious-mars-rock-looks-jelly-doughnut-defies-explanation-2D11972899\">analysis showed</a> the rock has twice the abundance of \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/25.shtml\">manganese</a> \nthan any other rock yet examined -- an unexpected clue that doesn't yet fit into humanity's understanding of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Mars\">Martian geologic</a> history. \n\n<a href=\"ap140125.html\">Opportunity</a>, just passing its \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/mer/mer-news-20140123/index.html\">10th\nanniversary</a> on \n<a href=\"ap040127.html\">Mars</a>, continues to explore the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/murray-ridge-on-mars/\">Murray Ridge</a> section of the rim of 22-kilometer wide \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavor_crater\">Endeavor Crater</a>.",
