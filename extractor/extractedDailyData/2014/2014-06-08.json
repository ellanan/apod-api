  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nJewels don't shine this bright -- only stars do.  \n\nLike gems in a jewel box, though, the stars of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster\">open cluster</a> \nNGC 290 glitter in a \n<a href=\"ap010618.html\">beautiful display</a> of brightness and color.   \n\nThe photogenic cluster, \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/17/image/a\">pictured above</a>, was captured recently by the orbiting \n<a href=\"ap021124.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  \n\nOpen clusters of stars are younger, contain few stars, \nand contain a much higher fraction of blue stars than do \n<a href=\"globular_clusters.html\">globular clusters</a> of stars.  \nNGC 290 lies about 200,000 \n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> \ndistant in a neighboring galaxy called the \n<a href=\"ap050617.html\">Small Cloud of Magellan</a> (SMC).    \n\nThe <a href=\"ap060109.html\">open cluster</a> contains hundreds of stars \nand spans about 65 light years across.  \n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSSA5lXgtwI\">NGC 290</a> \nand other open clusters are good laboratories for studying how \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution\">stars of different masses evolve</a>, \nsince all the open cluster's stars were born at about the same time.",
