  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes it is hard to believe what you see in the sky.\n\nWhile leading his annual \n<a href=\"http://www.galacticimages.com/galactic_trips.html\">aurora tour</a> last month near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbanks,_Alaska\">Fairbanks</a> in central \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska\">Alaska</a>, astrophotographer \n<a href=\"http://galacticimages.com/blog/\">John Chumack</a> and his company saw a \n<a href=\"ap121003.html\">most unusual aurora</a>.\n\nThis bright <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora\">aurora</a> appeared to change into the shape of a \n<a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2012/02/dog1_mini.jpg\">jumping dog</a>, complete with a curly \n<a href=\"http://www.dogsbestlife.com/home-page/dog-tail/\">tail</a>.\n\nHe was able to capture the fleeting natural apparition in the \nabove image with a 15-second exposure through a wide-angle lens.\n\nBy coincidence, he also captured a background sky filled with familiar highlights.\n\nPlanets visible include bright \n<a href=\"ap001212.html\">Jupiter</a> through the dog's front legs and \n<a href=\"ap140402.html\">reddish Mars</a> below the dog's \n<a href=\"http://www.just-one-liners.com/uncategorized/56259\">hind leg</a>s.\n\nStars visible include the \n<a href=\"ap130421.html\">Big Dipper</a> stars above the dog's midsection and reddish \n<a href=\"ap100106.html\">Betelgeuse</a> shining on the far right.\n\nThis dog would not be following him home, however, and within a few minutes \n<a href=\"ap110328.html\">morphed</a> into other shapes before the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm\">geomagnetic storm</a> \nparticles that created it shifted to strike the Earth elsewhere.",
