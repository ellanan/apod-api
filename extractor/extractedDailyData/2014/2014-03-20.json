  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nToday is the <a href=\"ap140319.html\">equinox</a>.\n\nThe Sun crosses the celestial equator heading north at 16:57 UT, marking\nthe northern hemisphere's first day of spring.\n\nTo celebrate, consider this remarkable image following the Sun's\nyearly trek through planet Earth's sky, the first\n<a href=\"http://www.analemma.com/\">analemmas</a>\nexposed every day through the technique of\n<a href=\"ap120121.html\">solargraphy</a>.\n\nIn fact, three analemma curves were captured using a\ncylindrical <a href=\"http://www.pinholephotography.org/\">pinhole camera</a>\nby daily making three, separate, one minute long\nexposures for a year,\nfrom March 1, 2013 to March 1, 2014,\non a single piece of black and white photographic paper.\n\n<a href=\"http://analemma.pl/english-version\">The well-planned\ndaily exposures began</a> at 10:30, 12:00, and 13:30, CET\nfrom a balcony looking south from the Kozanów district\nin Wrocław, Poland.\n\nThat year's two equinoxes on March 20 and\n<a href=\"ap130922.html\">September 22</a> correspond to\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Analemma_Earth.png\">the\nmid-points</a>, not the cross-over points,\nalong the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0765\">figure-8\nshaped curves</a>.\n\nApparent gaps in the curves are due to cloudy days.\n\nTwo solid lines at the lower left were both caused by a timer switch failure\nthat left the pinhole shutter open.",
