  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFixed to a tripod and looking east across the Kennedy Space\nCenter's Turn Basin,\n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/108563/\nstunning-astrophoto-captures-awe-inspiring-nasa-rocket-launch-amidst-star-trails/\">a camera captured</a> these star trails\nas a series of short exposures\nover a three hour period on the evening of January 23rd.\n\nPositioned just a few miles from  Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape\nCanaveral Air Force Station, it also captured a spectacular night\nlaunch of an Atlas V rocket carrying NASA's\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdrs/index.html\">Tracking\nand Data Relay Satellite TDRS-L</a>.\n\nCreating the trails,\n<a href=\"ap070519.html\">the apparent motion</a> of the stars through the\nsky is just a reflection of the daily rotation of planet Earth on its axis.\n\nBut that rotation is also the reason the\n<a href=\"ap130201.html\">rocket streak</a>\nfollows a path arcing east across the Atlantic.\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/launch-windows/en/\">Launching toward</a>\nthe east, in the direction of Earth's rotation,\nadds the rotation velocity to the rocket\nand reduces the fuel needed to reach orbit.\n\nA little ironically, TDRS-L is destined for a\n<a href=\"ap100220.html\">geostationary orbit</a>.\n\nFrom there, 36,000 kilometers or so above the\nequator, its orbital period will match Earth's rotation\nand the satellite will hang motionless\n<a href=\"ap120411.html\">in planet Earth's sky</a>.",
