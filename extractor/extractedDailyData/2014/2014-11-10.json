  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does this giant disk have gaps?\n\nThe exciting and probable answer is: planets.\n\nA mystery is how planets massive enough to create these gaps formed so quickly, since the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL_Tauri\">HL Tauri</a> \nstar system is only about one million years old.\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/110940294\">The picture</a> on which the \n<a href=\"http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/771-revolutionary-alma-image-reveals-planetary-genesis\">gaps were discovered</a> was taken with the new \n<a href=\"http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma\">Atacama Large Millimeter Array</a> \n(<a href=\"ap140526.html\">ALMA</a>) of telescopes in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.\n\nALMA imaged the protoplanetary disk, which spans about 1,500 light-minutes across, in \n<a href=\"https://public.nrao.edu/news/pressreleases/planet-formation-alma\">unprecedented detail</a>, resolving features as small as 40 light minutes. \n\nThe low energy light used by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array\">ALMA</a> \nwas also able to peer through an intervening haze of gas and dust.\n\nThe HL Tauri system lies about 450 \n<a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light years</a> from Earth.\n\nStudying <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...741....3K\">HL Tauri</a> \nwill likely give insight into \n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-system-formation/en/\">how our own Solar System formed</a> and evolved.",
