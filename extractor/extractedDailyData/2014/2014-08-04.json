  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does <a href=\"ap140406.html\">Enceladus</a> have ice plumes?\n\nThe discovery of jets spewing water vapor and ice was \n<a href=\"ap051205.html\">detected</a> by the Saturn-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens#Spacecraft_design\">Cassini spacecraft</a> in 2005. \n\nThe origin of the water feeding the jets, however, remained a \ntopic of research. \n\nA leading hypothesis held that the source might originate \nfrom a deep underground sea, \nbut another hypothesis indicated that it might just be ice melted off walls of deep rifts by the moon's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating\">tidal flexing</a> and heating. \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17184\">Pictured above</a>, \nthe textured surface of Enceladus is visible in the foreground, \nwhile rows of plumes rise from ice fractures in the distance. \n\nThese jets are made more visible by the \n<a href=\"ap120208.html\">Sun angle</a> and the encroaching shadow of night.\n\nRecent study of over a hundred images like this -- of geysers crossing \nEnceladus' South Pole, together with regional heat maps,  \n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45\">indicate that</a> \nthese plumes likely originate from a hidden sea,  \nincresaing the chance that this frosty globe might be \n<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/carolyn_porco_could_a_saturn_moon_harbor_life\">harboring life</a>.",
