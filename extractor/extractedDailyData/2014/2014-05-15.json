  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nCruising through the outer solar system, the Voyager 2\nspacecraft made its closest\n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/neptune.html\">approach\nto Neptune</a> on August 25, 1989,\nthe only spacecraft to visit the most distant\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant\">ice giant planet</a>.\n\nBased on the images recorded during its close encounter\nand in the following days,\n<a href=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/\nSolar-System/i-vjMHSxz\">this inspired composited scene</a> covers the\ndim outer planet, largest\n<a href=\"ap070304.html\">moon Triton</a>, and faint system of rings.\n\nFrom just beyond Neptune's orbit, the interplanetary perspective\nlooks back toward the Sun, capturing\nthe planet and Triton as thin\n<a href=\"ap130414.html\">sunlit crescents</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap100808.html\">Cirrus clouds</a> and a dark band\ncircle Neptune's south polar region,\nwith a cloudy vortex above the pole\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3240\">itself</a>.\n\nParts of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Neptune\">very\nfaint ring system</a> along with\nthe three bright ring arcs were first imaged by Voyager during the\nfly-by, though the faintest segments are modeled in this\ncomposited picture.\n\nSpanning 7.5 degrees, the background starfield is composed\nfrom sky survey data centered on the constellation Camelopardalis,\ncorresponding to the outbound Voyager's view of the\n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?\nObject=Neptune\">magnificent Neptunian system</a>.",
