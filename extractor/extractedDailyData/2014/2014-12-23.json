  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThese high cliffs occur on the surface of a comet.\n\nThey were discovered to be part of the dark nucleus of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet Churyumov�Gerasimenko</a> (CG) by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)\">Rosetta</a>, \na robotic spacecraft \n<a href=\"ap091123.html\">launched</a> by \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a> which began orbiting the comet in early August. \n\nThe ragged cliffs, as \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/12/Comet_on_10_December_2014_NavCam\">featured</a>  \n<a href=\"https://cumbriansky.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/the-cliffs-of-churyumov-gerasimenko/\">here</a>, were imaged by Rosetta about two weeks ago.\n\nAlthough towering about one kilometer high, the low surface gravity of \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/12/15/cometwatch-10-december/\">Comet CG</a> would likely make a \n<a href=\"ap140210.html\">jump</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap110404.html\">cliffs</a>, by a human, survivable. \n\nAt the foot of the cliffs is relatively smooth terrain dotted with \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/10/09/boulder-close-up/\">boulders</a> as large as 20 meters across.\n\nData from Rosetta indicates that the ice in Comet CG has a significantly different deuterium fraction -- and hence likely a <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_fuels_debate_on_origin_of_Earth_s_oceans\">different origin</a> -- than the water in Earth's oceans. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://rosetta.esa.int/\">Rosetta spacecraft</a> is scheduled to \ncontinue to accompany the comet as it makes its closest approach to the Sun in 2015 August.",
