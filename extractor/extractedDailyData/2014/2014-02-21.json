  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6792\">The Lighthouse nebula</a>\nwas formed by the wind of a pulsar,\na rapidly rotating, magnetized neutron star, as it\nspeeds through the interstellar medium at over 1,000 kilometers per\n<i>second</i>.\n\nSome 23,000 light-years distant toward the southern constellation\nCarina, pulsar and wind nebula (cataloged as IGR J1104-6103)\nare indicated at the lower right in\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/igrj11014/\">this\nremarkable image</a> from the Chandra\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/medxray.html\">X-ray</a>\nObservatory.\n\nEnergetic particles\n<a href=\"ap081227.html\">generated by the pulsar</a> are swept back into\nthe wind's comet-like tail trailing up and to the left, along the\ndirection of the pulsar's motion away from its\nparent supernova remnant.\n\nBoth runaway pulsar and expanding remnant debris field are\nthe aftermath of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nType_II_supernova\">core-collapse-explosion</a> of a massive\nstar, with the pulsar kicked out by the supernova explosion.\n\nAdding to the scene of exotic cosmic extremes is a\nlong, spiraling jet extending for almost 37 light-years,\nbut nearly at a right angle to the pulsar's motion.\n\nThe high-energy\n<a href=\"ap030703.html\">particle jet</a>\nis the longest known for any object in our Milky Way galaxy.",
