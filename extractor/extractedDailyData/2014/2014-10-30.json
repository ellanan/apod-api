  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/\nsdo-jack-o-lantern-sun/\">Frightening</a>\nforms and scary faces are a mark of the Halloween season.\n\nThey also haunt\n<a href=\"http://www.imagingdeepsky.com/Nebulae/NGC6995/NGC6995.htm\">this\ncosmic close-up</a> of the eastern Veil Nebula. \n\n<a href=\"ap100916.html\">The Veil Nebula</a> itself is a\nlarge supernova remnant, the expanding\ndebris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nWhile the Veil is roughly circular in shape and covers nearly 3 degrees\non the sky in the constellation Cygnus, this portion of the eastern\nVeil spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size\n<a href=\"ap130801.html\">of the Moon</a>.\n\nThat <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\nscale_distance.html\">translates</a> to 12 light-years at the Veil's\nestimated distance, a reassuring 1,400 light-years from planet Earth.\n\nIn the composite of image data recorded through broad and\n<a href=\"ap071102.html\">narrow band</a> filters,\nemission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong\nemission from oxygen atoms in blue-green hues.\n\nOf course, in the western part of the Veil lies another\nseasonal apparition,\n<a href=\"ap130529.html\">the Witch's Broom</a>.",
