  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLaunched on November 18, 2013, the MAVEN\n(<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/overview/index.html\">Mars\nAtmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN</a>)\nspacecraft completed its interplanetary voyage\nSeptember 21, captured into a wide, elliptical orbit around Mars.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/spacecraft/\nindex.html\">MAVEN's</a> imaging ultraviolet spectrograph has already begun\nits planned exploration of the Red Planet's upper atmosphere,\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/\nmaven-spacecraft-returns-first-mars-observations/index.html\">acquiring\nthis image data</a> from an altitude of 36,500 kilometers.\n\nIn false color, the three ultraviolet wavelength bands\nshow light reflected from atomic hydrogen (in blue), atomic oxygen (in green)\nand the planet's surface (in red).\n\nLow mass atomic hydrogen is seen to extend thousands of kilometers\ninto space, with the cloud of more massive oxygen atoms\nheld closer by Mars' gravity.\n\nBoth are by products of the breakdown of water and\ncarbon dioxide in Mars' atmosphere and the MAVEN data can\nbe used to determine the rate of water loss over time.\n\n<a href=\"http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/\">In fact, MAVEN is</a>\nthe first mission dedicated\nto exploring Mars' tenuous upper atmosphere, ionosphere and\n<a href=\"ap140904.html\">interactions</a> with the Sun and solar wind.\n\nBut the most recent addition to the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Exploration_missions\">fleet</a>\nof spacecraft from planet Earth now in\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/isromom\">martian orbit is MOM.</a>",
