  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLast January, telescopes in observatories around planet Earth\nwere eagerly used to watch the rise of SN 2014J,\na bright <a href=\"ap140124.html\">supernova in nearby galaxy M82</a>.\n\nStill, the most important observations may have been from orbit\nwhere the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/\">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>\nsaw <i>nothing</i>.\n\nIdentified as a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia\nsupernova</a>, the explosion of\nSN2014J was thought to be triggered\nby the buildup of mass on a white dwarf star steadily\n<a href=\"ap060726.html\">accreting material</a> from a companion star.\n\nThat model predicts X-rays would be generated\nwhen the supernova blastwave struck the material\nleft surrounding the white dwarf.\n\nBut no X-rays were seen from the supernova.\n\nThe mostly blank close-ups centered on the\nsupernova's position are shown\nin the before and after inset panels of\nChandra's false color\n<a href=\"http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2014/m82/\">X-ray image of\nthe M82</a> galaxy.\n\nThe stunning\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1488\">lack of X-rays</a>\nfrom SN 2014J will require astronomers to explore other models\nto explain what triggers these\n<a href=\"http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/science/\nSN1A.shtml\">cosmic explosions</a>.",
