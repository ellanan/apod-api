  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYesterday, a comet passed very close to Mars.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2013_A1\">Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring)</a> \npassed closer to the \n<a href=\"ap140511.html\">red planet</a> \nthan any comet has ever passed to Earth in recorded history.\n\nTo take advantage of this unique opportunity to study the close interaction of a comet and a planet, humanity currently has five active spacecraft orbiting Mars: NASA's \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/main/\">MAVEN</a>, \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/\">MRO</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/odyssey/\">Mars Odyssey</a>, \nas well as \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/mars-express/\">Mars Express</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://www.isro.org/\">India</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.isro.gov.in/mars/home.aspx\">Mars Orbiter</a>.\n\nMost of these spacecraft have now sent back information that they have \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/comets/sidingspring/\">not been damaged</a> \nby small pieces of the passing comet.\n\nThese spacecraft, as well as the two active rovers on the Martian surface -- NASA's \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/index.html\">Opportunity</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/\">Curiosity</a> -- \nhave taken data and images that will be downloaded to Earth for \nweeks to come and likely studied for years to come. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.damianpeach.com/deepsky/c2013_a1_2014_10_19dp.jpg\">featured image</a> \ntaken yesterday, however, was <i> not </i> taken from Mars but from Earth and shows \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/10171350-watching-siding-springs.html\">Comet Siding Spring</a> on the lower left as it passed Mars, on the upper right.",
