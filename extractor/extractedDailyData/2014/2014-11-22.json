  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/\none-giant-sunspot-6-substantial-flares/\">Solar active region AR2192</a>\nwas the largest recorded sunspot group of the last 24 years.\n\nBefore rotating off the\n<a href=\"ap141025.html\">Earth-facing side</a> of the Sun at the end of\nOctober, it <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/\nsunspot-ar2192-flare-family-portrait/\">produced a whopping</a>\nsix energetic X-class flares.\n\nIts most intense flare was captured on October 24 in this\nstunning view from the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>.\n\nThe scene is a\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/\nlight-wavelengths.html\">color combination</a> of\nimages made at three different wavelengths of\nextreme ultraviolet light;\n193 angstroms shown in blue, 171 angstroms in white, and 304 angstroms\nin red.\n\nThe emission, from highly ionized Iron and Helium atoms, traces\nmagnetic field lines looping through the hot\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29\">plasma</a>\nof the Sun's outer\n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml\">chromosphere</a>\nand corona.\n\nBeneath, the cooler solar photosphere appears dark at extreme ultraviolet\nwavelengths.\n\nThe exceptionally sharp composite image has been processed\nwith a new mathematical algorithm\n(<a href=\"http://www.zam.fme.vutbr.cz/~druck/Nafe/Index.htm\">NAFE</a>)\nthat adapts to noise and brightness in extreme ultraviolet\nimage data to reliably enhance small details.",
