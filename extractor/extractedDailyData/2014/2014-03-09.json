  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created this unusual hole in Mars?\n\n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023531_1840\">The hole</a> was discovered by chance in 2011 on images of the dusty slopes of Mars' \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavonis_Mons\">Pavonis Mons</a> volcano taken by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiRISE\">HiRISE</a> instrument aboard the robotic \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/overview/\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> \ncurrently circling Mars.\n\nThe hole appears to be an opening to an underground cavern, partly illuminated on the image right. \n\nAnalysis of this and follow-up images revealed the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Close-up_of_a_skylight_on_coastal_plain,_with_lava_stalactites_forming_on_the_roof_of_the_tube.jpg\">opening</a> to be about 35 meters across, while the interior \n<a href=\"ap110508.html\">shadow</a> angle indicates that the underlying cavern is roughly 20 meters deep.\n\nWhy there is a circular crater surrounding this hole remains a topic of \n<a href=\"http://www.lifeinthedoglane.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/puppy-head-tilt.jpg\">speculation</a>, \nas is the full extent of the underlying cavern.\n\n<a href=\"ap070528.html\">Holes</a> such as \n<a href=\"ap070928.html\">this</a> are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to \n<a href=\"http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2007/03/19/4349900-caves-on-mars\">contain Martian life</a>.\n\nThese pits are therefore prime targets for \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/\">possible future spacecraft, robots</a>, and even \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles\">human interplanetary explorers</a>.",
