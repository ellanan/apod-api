  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever seen an entire rainbow?\n\nFrom the ground, typically, only the top portion of a rainbow is <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/09/17/circular_rainbow_rare_optic_effect_seen_from_the_air.html\">visible because</a> directions toward the ground have fewer raindrops.\n\nFrom the air, though, the entire 360 degree circle of a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow\">rainbow</a> is more commonly visible.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.birdseyeviewphotography.com.au/blog/?p=1412\">Pictured here</a>, \na full circle rainbow was captured over \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJF0FjGGD0g\">Cottesloe Beach</a> near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth\">Perth</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> \nlast year by a helicopter flying between a setting sun and a downpour.\n\nAn observer-dependent \n<a href=\"http://scijinks.jpl.nasa.gov/rainbow/\">phenomenon</a> \nprimarily caused by the \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/orders.htm\">internal reflection</a> \nof sunlight by raindrops, the 84-degree diameter <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/bows.htm\">rainbow</a> \nfollowed the helicopter, intact, for about 5 kilometers.\n\nAs a <a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=33730\">bonus</a>, \na <a href=\"ap070912.html\">second rainbow</a> \nthat was more faint and color-reversed was visible outside the first.",
