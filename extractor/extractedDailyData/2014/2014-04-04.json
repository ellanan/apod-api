  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nDelicate in appearance, these filaments of shocked, glowing gas,\ndraped in planet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus,\nmake up the western part of\n<a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/spider/Misc/veil.html\">the Veil Nebula</a>.\n\nThe Veil Nebula itself is a large\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nsupernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a>, an expanding\ncloud born of the death explosion of a massive star.\n\nLight from the original supernova explosion likely reached\nEarth over 5,000 years ago.\n\nBlasted out in the cataclysmic event, the interstellar shock wave\nplows through space sweeping up and exciting interstellar material. \n\nThe glowing filaments are really more like long ripples in a sheet seen\nalmost edge on, remarkably well separated into\natomic hydrogen (red) and oxygen (blue-green) gas.\n\nAlso known as the Cygnus Loop, the\n<a href=\"http://archive.stsci.edu/fuse/scisumm/\nsci_cyglpstar.html\">Veil Nebula</a> now spans\nnearly 3 degrees or about 6 times the diameter of\nthe full Moon.\n\nWhile that translates to over 70 light-years\nat its estimated distance of 1,500 light-years, this wide\nimage of the western portion spans about  half that distance.\n\nBrighter parts of the western Veil are\nrecognized as separate nebulae, including The\n<a href=\"ap130529.html\">Witch's Broom</a>\n(NGC 6960) along the top of this view and\n<a href=\"ap080701.html\">Pickering's Triangle</a> (NGC 6979)\nbelow and right of center.",
