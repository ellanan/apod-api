  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan a gas cloud grab a galaxy?  \n\nIt's not even close.  \n\nThe \"claw\" of this odd looking \"creature\" in the \n<a href=\"http://cosmicphotos.com/gallery/image.php?fld_image_id=258&amp;fld_album_id=11\">above photo</a> is a gas cloud known as a \n<a href=\"http://www.public.iastate.edu/~sdk/fick/april.html\">cometary globule</a>. \n\nThis globule, however, has ruptured. \n\n<a href=\"ap131012.html\">Cometary globules</a> \nare typically characterized by \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dusty</a> heads and\nelongated <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...463L.105M\">tails</a>. \n\nThese features cause cometary \n<a href=\"ap081228.html\">globules</a> \nto have visual similarities to comets, \nbut in reality they are very much different. \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule\">Globules</a> \nare frequently the birthplaces of stars, \nand many show very young stars in their heads.\n\nThe reason for the rupture in the head of \n<a href=\"ap060314.html\">this object</a> is not completely known. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy\">galaxy</a> to the left of the globule\nis huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A%26A...293..493G\">CG4</a> by chance superposition.",
