  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy are the regions above sunspots so hot?\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot\">Sunspots</a> themselves are a bit cooler than the surrounding solar surface because the magnetic fields that create them reduce <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDUtS0IMws\">convective</a> heating. \n\nIt is therefore unusual that regions overhead -- even much higher up in the Sun's corona -- can be hundreds of times hotter.\n\nTo help find the cause, \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nasa\">NASA</a> directed the Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/page/about\">Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array</a> (NuSTAR) \nsatellite to point its very sensitive X-ray telescope at the Sun.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/news/nustar141222\">Featured above</a> is the Sun in ultraviolet light, \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=pia18906\">shown</a> \nin a red hue as taken by the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> (SDO). \n\nSuperimposed in false-colored green and blue is emission above sunspots detected by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuSTAR\">NuSTAR</a> in different bands of \nhigh-energy \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays.html\">X-rays</a>, \nhighlighting regions of extremely \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fuHzC9aTik\">high temperature</a>.\n\nClues about the Sun's atmospheric \n<a href=\"ap050814.html\">heating</a> \nmechanisms may not only come from this initial image, \nbut future NuSTAR images aimed at finding hypothesized \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoflares\">nanoflares</a>, \nbrief bursts of energy that may drive the unusual heating.",
