  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nAs you (safely!) watched the progress of yesterday's partial solar\neclipse, you probably also spotted a\n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/news/view/38/\n20141023-gentle-giant-sunspot-region-2192\">giant\nsunspot group</a>.\n\nCaptured in this sharp telescopic image from October 22nd\nthe complex AR 2192 is beautiful to see, a\nsprawling solar active region comparable in size\nto the diameter of Jupiter.\n\nLike other smaller sunspot groups,\n<a href=\"ap141022.html\">AR 2192</a> is now crossing the\n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Earth-facing side of the Sun</a>\nand appears dark in\nvisible light because it is cooler than the surrounding surface.\n\nStill, the energy stored in the region's twisted magnetic fields is\nenormous and has already generated powerful explosions, including\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/\noct-22-2014-third-substantial-solar-flare-in-2-days/index.html\">two\nX-class solar flares</a> this week.\n\nCoronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the flares have not\n<a href=\"ap140917.html\">affected planet Earth</a>, so far.\n\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\">The forecast</a>\nfor further activity from AR 2192 is still\nsignificant though, as it swings across the center of\nthe solar disk and Earth-directed CMEs become possible.",
