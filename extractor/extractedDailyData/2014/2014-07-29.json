  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTo some, it may look like a portal into the distant universe.\n\nTo others, it may appear as the eye of a giant.\n\nGiven <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poetic_licence\">poetic license</a>, both are correct.\n\nPictured above is a standard \n<a href=\"http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cameras-photography/tips/fisheye-lens-photography.htm\">fisheye</a> view of the \n<a href=\"ap090213.html\">sky</a> -- but with an unusual projection.\n\nThe view is from a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wjI7MH5qS8\">perch</a> in \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand\">New Zealand</a> called \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Mata_Peak\">Te Mata Peak</a>, a name that translates from the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language\">Maori language</a> \nas \"Sleeping Giant\".\n\nThe wondrous panorama shows the \n<a href=\"ap110710.html\">band</a> of our \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \nright down the center of the sky, with the \n<a href=\"ap131020.html\">Large and Small</a> Magellanic Clouds visible to the right.\n\nThe red hue is atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow1.htm\">airglow</a> \nthat surprised the photographer as it was better captured by the camera than the eye. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astronom.cz/horalek/?p=684\">above image</a> was taken two weeks ago as the photographer's sister, on the left, and an acquaintance  \n<a href=\"http://kuriositykilledthekat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Curious-cat.jpg\">peered</a> into the \n<a href=\"ap050413.html\">sky portal</a>.",
