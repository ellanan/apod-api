In fact, it's\nmuch bigger than all bread boxes put together.  <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1984ApJ%2E%2E%2E286%2E%2E422G\">Abell 2199</a>\nis huge.  In fact, it is a close, large <a href=\"lib/galaxy_clusters.html\">cluster of galaxies</a>,\ncontaining several <a href=\"http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jgodwin/a2199.htm\">thousands of galaxies</a>\ncentered around a central dominant galaxy.  \"Close,\"\nhowever, is only relative to other <a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>,\nsince light takes about 50 million years to reach us from\nA2199.  All of the fuzzy objects in the above picture are <a href=\"ap961009.html\">galaxies</a>,\nbut these galaxies do <i>not</i> contain most of the matter in\nthe cluster.  By studying clusters like A2199, astronomers conclude\nthat some form of <a href=\"http://physics7.berkeley.edu/group/directdet/pubs/sadoulet_lecture_nov95/dmtoc.html\">dark matter</a>\ndominates the motion of the bright galaxies.  What, exactly, this\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/matter.html\">dark matter</a>\nis poses one of the greatest astronomical puzzles of modern times.",
