  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis magnificent spiral galaxy is\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m064.html\">Messier 64</a>,\noften called the Black Eye Galaxy or the\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994AJ....107..173R\">Sleeping Beauty Galaxy</a>\nfor its\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CuoQujIPmiq/\">dark-lidded appearance</a>\nin telescopic views.\n\nThe spiral's central region,\nabout 7,400 light-years across, is pictured in this\nreprocessed image from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nM64 lies some 17 million light-years distant in the\notherwise well-groomed northern constellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/com/index.html\">Coma Berenices</a>.\n\nThe enormous dust clouds partially obscuring\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2004/04/1447-Image.html\">M64's central region</a>\nare laced with young, blue star clusters and the\nreddish glow of hydrogen associated with star forming regions.  \n\nBut imposing clouds of dust are not this galaxy's only peculiar feature.\n\nObservations show that M64 is actually\ncomposed of two concentric, counter-rotating systems.\n\nWhile all the stars in M64 rotate in the same direction as the\ninterstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, gas in the outer\nregions, extending to about 40,000 light-years, rotates in\nthe opposite direction.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-64-the-black-eye-galaxy\">The dusty eye</a>\nand bizarre rotation are likely the result of a\nbillion year old merger of two different galaxies.",
