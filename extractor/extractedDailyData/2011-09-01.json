  "title": "M27: Not a Comet",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhile hunting for comets in the skies above 18th century France,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/\nbiograph.html\">astronomer Charles Messier</a>\ndiligently kept a list of the things\nhe encountered that were definitely not comets.\n\nThis is number 27 on his\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/m-cat.html\">now\nfamous not-a-comet list</a>.\n\nIn fact, 21st century astronomers would identify it as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">planetary\nnebula</a>, but it's not a planet either, even though it may\n<a href=\"ap030614.html\">appear round</a> and\nplanet-like in a small telescope.\n\nMessier 27 (M27) is an excellent example of a\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/\">\ngaseous emission nebula</a> created\nas a <a href=\"ap100221.html\">sun-like star runs out</a>\nof nuclear fuel in its core.\n\nThe nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into\nspace, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying\nstar's intense but invisible\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nemspectrum.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.\n\nKnown by the popular name of the\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m027.html\">Dumbbell\nNebula</a>, the beautifully\nsymmetric interstellar gas cloud is over 2.5 light-years across and\nabout 1,200 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vul/index.html\">constellation\nVulpecula</a>.\n\nThis impressive color composite highlights details within\nthe well-studied central region and fainter, seldom imaged\nfeatures in the nebula's <a href=\"ap100509.html\">outer halo</a>.\n\nIt incorporates broad and narrowband images\n<a href=\"http://www.martinpughastrophotography.id.au/\nHeavens_Mirror.htm\">recorded using</a>\nfilters sensitive to emission from sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen atoms.",
