  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSoft hues, partially lit orbs, a thin trace of the ring, and slight shadows highlight this understated view of the majestic surroundings of the giant planet Saturn.  \n\nLooking nearly back toward the Sun, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens\">robot Cassini \nspacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn captured \n<a href=\"ap060618.html\">crescent phases</a> of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn\">Saturn</a> \nand its <a href=\"ap080513.html\">moon Rhea</a> in color a few years ago.\n\nAs striking as the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07806\">above image</a> is, it is but a single frame from a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Bg-9cors4\">60-frame silent movie</a> where Rhea can be seen gliding in front of its parent world.   \n\nSince Cassini was nearly in the plane of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&amp;Display=Rings\">Saturn's rings</a>, the normally impressive rings are visible here only as a \n<a href=\"ap051219.html\">thin line</a> across the image center.",
