  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBeautiful, luminous decorations on this pinyon pine tree\nare actually bright stars\nin the constellation <a href=\"ap140504.html\">Scorpius</a> and the\nfaint glow of the central Milky Way.\n\nCaptured in June from the north rim of the <a href=\"ap120330.html\">Grand\nCanyon</a> of planet Earth, the\nshallow, close focus image has rendered pine needles\non the tree branch sharp, but blurred the distant stars,\ntheir light smeared into remarkably colorful disks.\n\nOf course, temperature determines\n<a href=\"ap110211.html\">the color of a star</a>.\n\nMost of the\n<a href=\"ap040708.html\">out-of-focus</a> bright\nstars of Scorpius show a predominately blue hue,\ntheir surface temperatures much hotter than the Sun's.\n\nCooler and larger than the Sun, and noticably redder\non the scene, is giant star\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/antares.html\">Antares</a>\nat the heart of the scorpion.\n\nIn focused, telescopic views the whitish disk at the\nupper right would be immediately recognizable though,\nreflecting the Sun's light as ringed\n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/\">gas giant Saturn.</a>",
