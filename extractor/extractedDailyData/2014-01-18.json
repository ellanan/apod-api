  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis big, bright, beautiful Full Moon rose over\n<a href=\"ap120310.html\">Lick Observatory</a> Wednesday night.\n\nTraditionally a full moon in January might be called\n<a href=\"ap120120.html\">the Wolf Moon</a>.\n\nBut this moon reached its full phase on\nJanuary 16, 4:54 UT, within about 2 hours of apogee,\nthe most distant point in\n<a href=\"http://fourmilab.ch/earthview/moon_ap_per.html\">its\nelliptical orbit</a> around planet Earth.\n\nThat also makes it the\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/tonight/\nmicro-moon-years-smallest-full-moon-on-january-15-16\">smallest\nfull moon of 2014</a>.\n\nOf course the\n<a href=\"ap121129.html\">difference in\napparent size</a> between the largest and\nsmallest full moons is hard to see, because\nthe difference in distance between lunar apogee and perigee, or\nclosest point in the Moon's orbit, is only about 50,000 kilometers,\nwhile the Moon's average distance is around 385,000 kilometers.\n\nThough not by much,\n<a href=\"http://fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html\">this\napogee's full moon</a> was also the smallest full moon\nof the last 1,000 years.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Moon/8?\">It will keep</a>\nthat distinction until a slightly smaller full moon occurs\nclose to apogee in 2154.",
