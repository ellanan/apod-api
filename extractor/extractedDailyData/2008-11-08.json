  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn October 7, the early dawn over northern Sudan revealed this\ntwisted, high altitude trail.\n\nCaptured in a video frame, the long-lasting\n<a href=\"ap000428.html\">persistent train</a> is\nfrom the impact of a small asteroid cataloged as 2008 TC3.\n\nThat event was remarkable because it was the first time an asteroid\nwas detected in space\n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/30686199.html\">before\ncrashing</a> into planet Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIn fact, after astronomers discovered\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001684/\">2008 TC3,\nthe time and location</a>\nof its impact were predicted based on follow-up observations.\n\nLater, the impact predictions were confirmed by sensors, including a\n<a href=\"http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Media/Features/\n707785\">Meteosat-8 image</a> of a bright flash in the atmosphere.\n\nAstronomers are now\n<a href=\"http://asima.seti.org/\">hoping for more reports</a> of\nlocal ground-based observations of what must have\nbeen a <a href=\"ap081011.html\">brilliant meteor</a>\nstreaking through\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan\">Sudan's</a> night sky.\n\n<a href=\"http://asima.seti.org/\">Additional reports</a>\ncould improve the chances of recovering\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/meteorites.html\">meteorites</a>.",
