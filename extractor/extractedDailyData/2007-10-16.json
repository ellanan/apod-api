  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat could cause a bang this big?  \n\nThis \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova explosion</a> \nwas so inherently bright that it could be seen nearly 5 billion \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> away (a \n<a href=\"http://astsun.astro.virginia.edu/~jh8h/glossary/redshift.htm\">redshift</a> \nof 0.28) even with a small telescope.\n\nSpecific colors emitted during \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007arXiv0709.0302Q\">SN 2005ap</a> \nindicate that it was a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova\">Type II supernova</a>, \na breed of stellar explosion that results when a high mass star begins \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion\">fusing</a> \nheavy elements in or near its core.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/bmendez/ay10/2000/cycle/snII.html\">Type II supernovas</a> may be more powerful than their \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova\">Type Ia cousins</a>, \nbut they are not currently more useful cosmologically because \n<a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_14282_become-astronomer.html\">astronomers</a> don't understand how to accurately recover their \n<a href=\"http://astsun.astro.virginia.edu/~teacha/130_manual/node30.html\">intrinsic brightnesses</a>.  \n\nIt is therefore dimmer \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgfbjHz_UTo\">Type Ia supernova</a>s \nthat are used by astronomers to calibrate the \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/redshift.html\">distance scale</a> \nof the nearby universe.  \n\nWere Type II <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">supernova</a> \nbetter understood, astronomers might be able to \n<a href=\"ap061224.html\">probe distances</a> \nfurther into the universe, and so probe the stability of the strange \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy\">dark energy</a> that dominates the present universe.\n\n<a href=\"http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/news/releases/2007/1010.html\">Pictured above</a> \nin a digitally compressed image, the bright supernova SN 2005ap is \nvisible on the right where no exploding star had been seen on the \nleft less than three months before.",
