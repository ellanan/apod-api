  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDid you see it? \n\nOne of the more common questions during a \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/\">meteor shower</a> occurs because the time it takes for a \nmeteor to flash is similar to the time it takes for a head to turn. \n\nPossibly, though, the glory of seeing \n<a href=\"ap230809.html\">bright meteors</a> shoot across the sky -- \nwhile knowing that they were once small \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/facts/\">pebbles</a> on \n<a href=\"ap151118.html\">another world</a> -- might make it all worthwhile, \neven if your observing partner(s) can't always share in your experience.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CwrvN0Q9_Sg\">featured video</a> is composed of short clips taken in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1NnMJUvU1L0\">Inner Mongolia</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a> during the 2023 \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>.\n\nSeveral bright meteors were captured while \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/olq7Qr1H_PI\">live-reaction audio</a> was being recorded -- just as the \n<a href=\"ap181209.html\">meteors flashed</a>. \n\nThis year's \n<a href=\"ap240812.html\">2024 Perseids</a> also produced \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.488496753878907&amp;type=3\">many beautiful meteors</a>.\n\nAnother <a href=\"https://www.space.com/39469-best-meteor-showers.html\">good meteor shower</a> to watch for is the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids\">Geminids</a> which peak yearly in mid-December, \nthis year with relatively little competing glow from a nearly new Moon.",
