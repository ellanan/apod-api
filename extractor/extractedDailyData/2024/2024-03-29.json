  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nLooping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/\">Galileo spacecraft</a>\nrecorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered\nevidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides\na deep, global ocean.\n\nGalileo's Europa image data has been\n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/?IDNumber=PIA19048\">\nremastered here</a>, with improved calibrations to produce a\ncolor image approximating what the human eye might see.\n\nEuropa's long curving fractures\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa\">hint at the subsurface liquid water</a>.  \n\nThe tidal flexing the large moon experiences\nin its elliptical orbit\naround Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid.\n\nBut more\n<a href=\"ap140919.html\">tantalizing</a> is the possibility\nthat even in the\nabsence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to\nsupport life,\n<a href=\"ap160401.html\">making Europa</a>\none of the best places to look for life\nbeyond Earth.\n\nThe Juno spacecraft currently in Jovian orbit\nhas also made repeated flybys of the water world,\nreturning images along with data exploring\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/juno/nasas-juno-mission-measures-oxygen-production-at-europa/\">Europa's habitability</a>.\n\nThis October will see the launch of the NASA's\n<a href=\"https://europa.nasa.gov/\">Europa Clipper</a>\non a voyage of\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgWbeDNPD6o\">exploration</a>.\n\nThe spacecraft will make nearly 50 flybys,\napproaching to within 25 kilometers of Europa's icy surface.",
