  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBy starlight, this eerie visage shines in the dark\nwith a crooked profile evoking its popular name, the\n<a href=\"ap061211.html\">Witch Head Nebula</a>.\n\nIn fact, this entrancing\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/197697877@N05/53527999667/\">telescopic portrait</a>\ngives the impression that\na witch has fixed her gaze on Orion's bright supergiant\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel\">star Rigel</a>.\n\nMore formally known as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2118\">IC 2118</a>,\nthe Witch Head Nebula spans about 50 light-years and\nis composed of interstellar dust grains reflecting \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997MNRAS.290..521I/abstract\">Rigel's starlight</a>.\n\nThe color of the Witch Head Nebula is caused not only by Rigel's \nintense blue light, but because the\n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">dust grains scatter blue light</a> more efficiently than red.\n\nThe same\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html\">physical process</a>\ncauses\n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">Earth's daytime\nsky</a>\nto appear blue, although the scatterers in\nEarth's atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.\n\nRigel and this dusty cosmic crone are about 800 light-years away.\n\nYou may still see a few witches in your neighborhood tonight though,\nso have a safe and\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/immersive/galaxy-of-horrors/\">Happy Halloween!</a>",
