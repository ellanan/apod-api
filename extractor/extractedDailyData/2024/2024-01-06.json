  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nYou couldn't really be caught\nin this blizzard while standing by a cliff on\nperiodic comet\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/67p-churyumov-gerasimenko/in-depth/\">67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>.\n\nOrbiting the comet in June of 2016, the \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta\">Rosetta</a>\nspacecraft's narrow angle camera did record streaks of dust\nand ice particles similar to snow as they drifted across the\nfield of view close to the camera and\n<a href=\"ap170331.html\">above</a> the comet's surface.\n\nStill, some of the\n<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2167224-amazing-gif-shows-dust-and-cosmic-rays-raining-down-on-comet-67p/\">bright specks</a>\nin the scene are likely due to a rain\nof energetic charged particles or\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2016/ace-cosmic-ray\">cosmic rays</a>\nhitting the camera, and the dense background of\nstars in the direction of the constellation of the Big Dog \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major\">Canis Major</a>).\n\n<a href=\"image/1804/RosettaOsirisC67P_JacintRoger.gif\">In the video</a>, the background stars are easy to spot trailing from top to bottom.\n\nThe stunning movie was constructed from 33\n<a href=\"https://imagearchives.esac.esa.int/index.php?/category/410/start-72#top\">consecutive images</a>\ntaken over 25 minutes while Rosetta cruised some 13 kilometers from \n<a href=\"ap200127.html\">the comet's nucleus</a>.\n\nIn September 2016, the nucleus became the final\nresting place for the Rosetta spacecraft after its\nmission was ended with a successful controlled impact on\n<a href=\"ap211113.html\">67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>.",
