  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens when a black hole devours a star? \n\nMany details remain unknown, but observations are providing new clues.\n\nIn 2014, a \n<a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa6003\">powerful explosion</a> was recorded by the ground-based robotic telescopes of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml\">All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae</a> (Project ASAS-SN), \nwith followed-up observations by instruments including \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov\">NASA</a>'s Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Swift satellite</a>.\n\nComputer modeling of these emissions fit a star being \n<a href=\"https://thedoorguardian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DOG-14.jpg\">ripped apart</a> by a distant \n<a href=\"ap130312.html\">supermassive black hole</a>. \n\nThe results of such a collision are portrayed in the \n<a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2017/black-hole-choking-stardust-0315\">featured artistic illustration</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/black-holes/\">black hole</a> itself is a depicted as a tiny black dot in the center.\n\nAs matter falls toward \n<a href=\"ap220501.html\">the hole</a>, it collides with other matter and \n<a href=\"http://stronggravity.eu/public-outreach-tmp/accretion-disks/\">heats up</a>.\n\nSurrounding the black hole is an \n<a href=\"ap050312.html\">accretion disk</a> \nof hot matter that used to be the star, with a \n<a href=\"ap131120.html\">jet</a> emanating from the \n<a href=\"ap011029.html\">black hole's spin axis</a>.",
