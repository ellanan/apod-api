  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNine days ago, two quite different sky icons were imaged rising together.\n\nSpecifically, Earth's Moon shared the eastern \nsky with the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_(Greek_mythology)\">sister stars</a> of the Pleiades cluster, as viewed from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/COtpTM1MpAA\">Alberta</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>. \n\nAstronomical images of the\n<a href=\"ap221205.html\">well-known Pleiades</a>\noften show the star cluster's alluring blue \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/reflection-nebula/\">reflection nebula</a>s, but here they are washed-out by the \norange <a href=\"ap211010.html\">moonrise</a> sky.\n\nThe half-lit Moon, known as a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/moon-phases-fromsse.jpg\">quarter moon</a>, is overexposed, although \nthe outline of the dim lunar night side can be seen by illuminating \n<a href=\"ap211018.html\">earthshine</a>, light first reflected \nfrom the Earth.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1185547962683479\">featured image</a> is a composite of \n<a href=\"https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/cute-cat-kittens-sitting-each-other-order-dark-to-light-color-all-looking-towards-camera-isolated-white-297725989.jpg\">eight successive</a> exposures with \nbrightnesses adjusted to match what the \n<a href=\"https://www.geogebra.org/m/SjGyuKNs\">human eye</a> would see. \n\nThe Moon passes \n<a href=\"ap180319.html\">nearly</a> -- or \n<a href=\"ap100326.html\">directly</a> -- in front of \n<a href=\"ap240129.html\">the Pleaides</a> once a month.",
