  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo other stars have planets like our Sun?\n\nSurely they do, and evidence includes slight \nstar wobbles created by the gravity of orbiting \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/\">exoplanets</a> \nand slight star dimmings caused by orbiting planets moving in front.\n\nIn all, there have now been over 5,500 \n<a href=\"ap190710.html\">exoplanets</a> discovered, including \nthousands by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s space-based \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/kepler/\">Kepler</a> and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tess/\">TESS</a> missions, and over 100 by \n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/\">ESO</a>'s ground-based \n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/36/harps/\">HARPS</a> instrument. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.halcyonmaps.com/#/the-exoplanet-zoo/\">Featured here</a> is an illustrated guess \nas to what some of these \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/\">exoplanets</a> might look like.\n\n<a href=\"ap230527.html\">Neptune</a>-type planets occupy the middle and are \ncolored blue because of blue-scattering \n<a href=\"ap190422.html\">atmospheric methane</a> they might contain.\n\nOn the sides of the illustration, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>-type \nplanets are shown, colored tan and red from the \nscatterings of atmospheric gases that likely include small amounts of \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml\">carbon</a>. \n\nInterspersed are many Earth-type \n<a href=\"ap230201.html\">rocky planet</a>s of many colors.\n\nAs more \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_planets\">exoplanets</a> are discovered and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-webb-reveals-steamy-atmosphere-of-distant-planet-detail/\">investigated</a>, humanity is developing a \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cc/1f/d2/cc1fd22b9cd2bf70dc1068310a0a3067.jpg\">better understanding</a> of how common Earth-like planets are, and how common life might be in the universe.",
