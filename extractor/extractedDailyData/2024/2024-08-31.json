  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGalaxies of the NGC 7771 Group are featured in\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/wt7ct9/\">this intriguing skyscape</a>.\n\nSome 200 million light-years distant toward the constellation\nPegasus,\n<a href=\"ap090829.html\">NGC 7771 is</a> the large, edge-on\nspiral near center,\nabout 75,000 light-years across, with two smaller galaxies below it.\n\nLarge spiral NGC 7769 is seen face-on to the right.\n\nGalaxies of the NGC 7771 group are interacting, making\nrepeated close passages that will ultimately result\nin galaxy-galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale.\n\nThe interactions can be traced by\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2002/news-2002-22.html\">distortions</a>\nin the shape of the galaxies themselves\nand faint <a href=\"ap080619.html\">streams of stars</a>\ncreated by their mutual gravitational tides.\n\nBut a clear view of this galaxy group is difficult to come by as\nthe deep image also reveals extensive clouds of\n<a href=\"ap170627.html\">foreground dust</a> sweeping across the field\nof view.\n\nThe dim, dusty galactic cirrus clouds are known as Integrated Flux Nebulae.\n\nThe faint IFN reflect starlight from our own Milky Way Galaxy\nand lie only a few hundred light-years above the\n<a href=\"ap090613.html\">galactic plane</a>.",
