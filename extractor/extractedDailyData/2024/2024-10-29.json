  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe stars are destroying the pillars.\n\nMore specifically, some of the newly formed \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/types/\">stars</a> in the image center are emitting light so energetic that is \n<a href=\"ap231206.html\">evaporating</a> \nthe gas and dust in the surrounding \n<a href=\"ap201206.html\">pillars</a>.\n\nSimultaneously, the \n<a href=\"ap230110.html\">pillar</a>s themselves are still trying to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation\">form new stars</a>.\n\nThe whole setting is the star cluster \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_602\">NGC 602</a>, \nand this new vista was taken by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/\">Webb Space Telescope</a> in multiple \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/\">infrared</a> colors.\n\nIn comparison, a roll-over image shows the same star cluster in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/\">visible light</a>, taken previously by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nNGC 602 is located near the perimeter of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> (SMC), \na small satellite galaxy of our Milky Way galaxy. \n\nAt the estimated distance of the SMC, the \n<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2425c/\">featured picture</a> spans about 200 light-years.\n\nA <a href=\"https://cdn.animalchannel.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06062531/concerned_dog_featured-1.png\">tantalizing</a> assortment of \n<a href=\"ap210802.html\">background galaxies</a> are also visible -- mostly around the edges -- that are at least hundreds of millions of \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-year</a>s beyond.",
