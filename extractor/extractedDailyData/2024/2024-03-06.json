  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat kind of celestial object is this?\n\nA relatively normal galaxy -- but seen from its edge. \n\nMany disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, \nthe Spindle galaxy, \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/xhlow5/\">pictured here</a>, but are not \n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">seen edge-on</a> from our vantage point.  \n\nA perhaps more familiar galaxy seen edge-on is our own \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way galaxy</a>. \n\nAlso cataloged as M102, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866\">Spindle galaxy</a> \nhas numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, \nwhile many of the bright stars in the disk give it \na more blue underlying hue. \n\nThe blue disk of young \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/\">stars</a> \ncan be seen in this \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/\">Hubble</a> \nimage extending past the \n<a href=\"ap990919.html\">dust</a> in the extremely \n<a href=\"ap180725.html\">thin galactic plane</a>.\n\nThere is evidence that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_(textiles)#/media/File:Drop_spindles.jpg\">Spindle</a> galaxy has cannibalized \nsmaller galaxies over the past billion years or so, including \n<a href=\"ap180206.html\">multiple streams</a> of faint stars, \ndark dust that extends away from the main galactic plane, and a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866_Group\">surrounding group</a> \nof galaxies (not shown). \n\nIn general, many <a href=\"ap230531.html\">disk galaxies become thin</a> because the gas that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution\">forms them</a> collides with itself as it rotates about the gravitational center.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap160309.html\">Spindle galaxy</a> \nlies about 50 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light years</a> distant toward the constellation of the Dragon\n(<a href=\"http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/draco.htm\">Draco</a>).",
