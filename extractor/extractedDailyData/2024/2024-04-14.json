  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow does a total solar eclipse end?\n\nYes, the Moon moves out from fully\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/solar-eclipse-diagram/\">blocking the Sun</a>,\nbut in the first few seconds of transition,\n<a href=\"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24a2197245b616b1b04c4fbd4744c471-pjlq\">interesting things appear</a>.\n\nThe first is called a\n<a href=\"ap201218.html\">diamond ring</a>.\n\nLight might stream between mountains or through relative lowlands around the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_limb\">Moon's edge</a>,\nas seen from your location, making this sudden first light,\nwhen combined with the\n<a href=\"ap240402.html\">corona</a> that surrounds the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/\">Moon</a>, look like a\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Classic_Diamond_Engagement_Ring.jpg\">diamond ring</a>.\n\nWithin seconds other light streams appear that are called, collectively,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads\">Bailey's\nbeads</a>.\n\nIn the\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidduarte_astro/53645501807/in/pool-apods/\">featured video</a>, it may seem that the\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=413131944748722&amp;set=a.410844681644115\">pink triangular prominence</a> on the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>\nis somehow related to where the Sun begins to reappear, but it is not.\n\nObservers from other locations saw\n<a href=\"ap150328.html\">Bailey's beads</a>\nemerge from different places around the Moon,\naway from the iconic triangular\n<a href=\"ap230801.html\">solar prominence</a> visible to all.\n\nThe video was captured with specialized equipment from\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fo0tD-xNteQ?t=11\">New Boston</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> on April\n8, 2024.",
