  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow different are these two streaks? \n\nThe streak on the upper right is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS)\">Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas</a> showing an \n<a href=\"ap241111.html\">impressive dust tail</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/\">comet</a> is a large and dirty iceberg that entered the inner \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/\">Solar System</a> and is \n<a href=\"ap151118.html\">shedding</a> gas and dust \nas it is warmed by the Sun's light.\n\nThe streak on the lower left is a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/\">meteor</a> showing an impressive \n<a href=\"ap240714.html\">evaporation trail</a>. \n\nThe meteor is a small and cold rock that entered the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/\">Earth's atmosphere</a> and is shedding gas and dust as it is \n<a href=\"https://packaged-media.redd.it/v0wnspc5dg2e1/pb/m2-res_650p.mp4?m=DASHPlaylist.mpd&amp;v=1&amp;e=1732327200&amp;s=e59e3c622e0eebc98f47bd85e214ecb24461a327\">warmed</a> by molecular collisions. \n\nThe meteor was likely once part of a comet or \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/\">asteroid</a> -- perhaps later composing part of its tail. \n\nThe meteor was \n<a href=\"ap240826.html\">gone in a flash</a> \nand was only caught by coincidence during a \nseries of exposures documenting the \n<a href=\"ap241021.html\">comet's long tail</a>.\n\nThe featured image was captured just over a month ago from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/so00OtYwHJ8\">Sichuan Province</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>.",
