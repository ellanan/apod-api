  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if a rocket could return to its launch tower -- and be caught? \n\nThis happened for the first time 10 days ago, after a \n<a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/\">SpaceX Starship</a> rocket blasted off from its pad in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)\">Boca Chica</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nStarship then \n<a href=\"https://chert-poberi.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/proga/222/sasha-19october1619394239.jpg\">split</a>, as planned, \nwith its upper stage landing in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean\">Pacific Ocean</a>.\n\nThe big difference was the lower stage, \n<a href=\"https://starship-spacex.fandom.com/wiki/Booster_12_(B12)\">Super Heavy Booster 12</a>, was caught by its launch tower about \n<a href=\"https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1845442658397049011\">7 minutes later</a>.\n\nCatching a rocket for reuse is a new and \ninnovative way to help reduce the cost of \n<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacex-launches-fifth-starship-test-eyes-novel-booster-catch-2024-10-13/\">rocket flight</a> by making rockets more easily reusable. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship\">Starship</a> rockets may be used by \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> in the \nfuture to send spacecraft to <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/orbits/\">Earth orbit</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap190717.html\">Moon</a>, and even \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mars/\">other planet</a>s.",
