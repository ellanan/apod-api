  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNot one, but two comets appeared near the Sun during \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/april-8-total-solar-eclipse-through-the-eyes-of-nasa/\">last week's total solar eclipse</a>.\n\nThe expected comet was \n<a href=\"ap240408.html\">Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks</a>, \nbut it was disappointingly dimmer than many had hoped.\n\nHowever, relatively unknown <a href=\"https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/49697/20240411/sungrazer-comet-soho-5008-total-solar-eclipse.htm\">Comet SOHO-5008 also appeared</a> in long duration camera exposures.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/tiny-sungrazer-comet-discovered-photographed-and-destroyed-all-during-historic-total-solar-eclipse\">This comet</a> was the 5008th comet identified on images taken by \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a> &amp; \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s Sun-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/about/spacecraft.html\">SOHO spacecraft</a>. \n\nLikely much smaller, Comet SOHO-5008 was a sungrazer which \n<a href=\"https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2024/04/12/this-comet-did-not-survive-the-eclipse/\">disintegrated within hours</a> as it passed too \n<a href=\"ap240219.html\">near the Sun</a>. \n\nThe featured image is not only unusual for capturing \n<a href=\"ap171002.html\">two comets</a> during an eclipse, \nbut one of the <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/nicos-nextbots-fanmade/images/2/23/WOW_Three_Cats.png\">rare times</a> that a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungrazing_comet\">sungrazing comet</a> has been photographed from the Earth's surface.\n\nAlso visible in the image is the \n<a href=\"ap230516.html\">sprawling corona</a> of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">our Sun</a> and the planets \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/\">Mercury</a> (left) and \n<a href=\"ap220306.html\">Venus</a> (right). \n\nOf these planets and comets, only \n<a href=\"ap230306.html\">Venus</a> was easily visible to \n<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/millions-of-people-witness-rare-total-solar-eclipse-across-north-america\">millions of people</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap240324.html\">dark shadow of the Moon</a> that \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when\">crossed North America</a> on April 8.",
