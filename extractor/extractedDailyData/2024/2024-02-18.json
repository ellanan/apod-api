  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs this one galaxy or two?  \n\nThis question came to light in 1950 when astronomer\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Allen_Hoag\">Arthur Hoag</a>\nchanced upon this unusual extragalactic object.  \n\nOn the outside is a\n<a href=\"ap051022.html\">ring</a> dominated by bright blue stars,\nwhile near the center lies a ball of much redder stars\nthat are likely much older.  \n\nBetween the two is a\n<a href=\"ap040702.html\">gap</a> that appears almost completely dark.  \n\nHow <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...348..448W/abstract\">Hoag's Object</a> formed, including \nits nearly \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LvpCX89lHvU\">perfectly round ring</a> \nof stars and gas, remains unknown. \n\nGenesis hypotheses include a\n<a href=\"https://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Struck/frames.html\">galaxy collision</a>\nbillions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a\n<a href=\"ap080622.html\">central bar</a> that has\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010CeMDA.108...23F/\">since vanished</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/skeebg/D/?nc=user\">featured \nphoto</a> was taken by the\n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nand reprocessed using an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Image_Prior\">artificially intelligent de-noising algorithm</a>. \n\nObservations in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio waves</a> \nindicate that \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435..475B/\">Hoag's Object</a> has <i>not</i> \naccreted a smaller galaxy in the past billion years. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoag%27s_Object\">Hoag's Object</a> spans about 100,000\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> and lies about 600 million <a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> away toward the <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/\">constellation</a> of the Snake\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens_(constellation)\">Serpens</a>).  \n\nMany galaxies far in the distance are visible toward the right, while \n<a href=\"https://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/252026/slide_252026_1551499_free.jpg\">coincidentally</a>, visible in the gap at about seven o'clock, \nis another but more distant <a href=\"ap150419.html\">ring galaxy</a>.",
