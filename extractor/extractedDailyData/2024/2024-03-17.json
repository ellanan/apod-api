  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs this galaxy jumping through a \n<a href=\"ap150419.html\">giant ring of stars</a>? \n\nProbably not. \n\nAlthough the precise \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...589..157S/abstract\">dynamics behind</a> \nthe featured image is yet unclear, what is clear is that the pictured galaxy, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIBcXo-oXo\">NGC 7714</a>, \nhas been stretched and distorted by a recent collision with a neighboring galaxy.\n\nThis smaller neighbor, \n<a href=\"http://faculty.etsu.edu/smithbj/captions/n7714cap.html\">NGC 7715</a>, \nsituated off to the left of the frame, is thought to have \n<a href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/5250/5228406300_27e05d74b7_b.jpg\">charged</a> right through \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1503/\">NGC 7714</a>.\n\nObservations indicate that the golden \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rudypohl/32588157757/in/photostream/\">ring pictured</a> is composed of millions of older Sun-like stars \nthat are likely co-moving with the \n<a href=\"ap221205.html\">interior bluer stars</a>.\n\nIn contrast, the bright center of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7714\">NGC 7714</a> \nappears to be undergoing a burst of new star formation. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/399094/J/?nc=user\">featured image</a> \nwas captured by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nNGC 7714 is located about 130 million \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/faq/26/what-is-a-light-year/\">light years</a> \naway toward the constellation of the Two Fish \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation)\">Pisces</a>). \n\nThe <a href=\"ap150212.html\">interactions</a> between these galaxies \nlikely started about 150 million \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_natural_history\">years ago</a> \nand should continue for several hundred million \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future\">years more</a>, after which a \n<a href=\"ap220606.html\">single central galaxy</a> may result.",
