  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMajestic on a truly cosmic scale, M100 is appropriately known as a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_design_spiral_galaxy\">grand design</a> spiral galaxy. \n\nThe large galaxy of over 100 billion stars has\nwell-defined spiral arms, similar to our own \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html\">Milky Way</a>. \n\nOne of the brightest members of the \n<a href=\"ap110422.html\">Virgo Cluster</a> of galaxies, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_100\">M100</a>,\nalso known as NGC 4321 is 56 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light-years</a> \ndistant toward the well-groomed constellation\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices\">Coma Berenices</a>. \n\nIn this telescopic image, the face-on grand design spiral shares \na nearly 1 degree wide field-of-view with slightly less conspicuous\nedge-on spiral NGC 4312 (at upper right).\n\nThe 21 hour long equivalent exposure from a dark sky site near\nFlagstaff, Arizona, planet Earth,\nreveals M100's bright blue star clusters and intricate winding \ndust lanes which are hallmarks of this class of galaxies. \n\nMeasurements of variable stars in \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-100\">M100</a> \nhave played an important role in determining the \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate96.html\">size and age of the Universe</a>.",
