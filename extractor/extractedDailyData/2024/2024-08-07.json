  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTo some, they look like battlements, \nhere protecting us against the center of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way</a>.\n\nThe Three \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlon\">Merlon</a>s, \nalso called the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre_Cime_di_Lavaredo\">Three Peaks of Lavaredo</a>, stand tall today because they are made of dense dolomite rock which has better resisted \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-43_HBy9huc\">erosion</a> \nthan surrounding softer rock.\n\nThey formed about \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/timeline-of-a-mass-extinction/\">250 million years ago</a> and so are comparable in age with one of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/the-great-dying/\">great extinctions</a> of life on \n<a href=\"ap240324.html\">Earth</a>.\n\nA leading hypothesis is that this great \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/could-recent-supernovae-be-responsible-for-mass-extinctions/\">extinction</a> \nwas triggered by an \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/\">asteroid</a> about 10-km across, larger in size than \n<a href=\"ap110417.html\">Mount Everest</a>, impacting the Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/history/the-human-desire-for-exploration-leads-to-discovery/\">Humans</a> have gazed up at the stars in the \n<a href=\"ap170726.html\">Milky Way</a> and beyond for centuries, \nmaking these battlefield-like formations, based in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexten_Dolomites\">Sexten Dolomites</a>, a popular place for \n<a href=\"https://skywiseunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/scoper_05.jpg\">current</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy\">ancient astronomers</a>.",
