  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it look like to return home from outside our galaxy?\n\nAlthough designed to answer \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGri4YNggoc\">greater questions</a>, \ndata from ESA's robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Gaia_overview\">Gaia mission</a> is helping to provide a uniquely \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/milky-way-mapper-6-ways-the-gaia-spacecraft-will-change-astronomy-1.20569\">modern perspective</a> on humanity's place in the universe. \n\nGaia \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit\">orbits</a> the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun\">Sun</a> near the \n<a href=\"ap220206.html\">Earth</a> and resolves \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT0Xh1BizSI\">stars' positions</a> so precisely that it can determine a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z_O66Z4l6Y\">slight shift</a> from its changing vantage point over the course of a year, a shift that is proportionately smaller for more \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/solar_neighborhood.html\">distant stars</a> -- and so \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder\">determines distance</a>. \n\nIn the first sequence of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XORui0wFKnE\">the video</a>, \nan illustration of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/milky-way-our-location/\">Milky Way</a> is shown that soon \n<a href=\"ap111018.html\">resolves</a> into a three-dimensional \n<a href=\"https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/outreach/gaiasky/\">visualization of Gaia star data</a>. \n\nA few notable stars are labelled with their \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/starname.html\">common names</a>, while others stars are labelled with numbers from a \n<a href=\"http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1\">Gaia catalog</a>.\n\nEventually, the \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">viewer arrives</a> in our stellar neighborhood \nwhere many stars were tracked by Gaia, and soon at our home star Sol, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KQetemT1sWc\">the Sun</a>.\n\nAt the video's end, the reflective glow of Sol's third planet becomes visible: \n<a href=\"ap100713.html\">Earth</a>.",
