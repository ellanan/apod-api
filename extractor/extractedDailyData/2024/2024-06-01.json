  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGet out your\nred/blue glasses and float next to Helene,\nsmall, icy moon of Saturn.\n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/helene/in-depth/\">Appropriately named, Helene</a>\nis a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-a-lagrange-point/\">Lagrange point</a>.\n\nA Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position\nnear two massive bodies, in this case\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/overview/\">Saturn\nand larger moon Dione</a>.\n\nIn fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers)\nHelene orbits at Dione's leading Lagrange point while\nbrotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione's trailing Lagrange\npoint.\n\n<a href=\"http://space-3d-images.blogspot.com/2011/06/\nhelene-3d-cassini-cattura-la-regina-del.html\">The sharp stereo\nanaglyph</a> was constructed from two\nCassini images captured during\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/\">a\nclose flyby</a> in 2011.\n\nIt shows part of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Helene\nmottled with craters and gully-like features.",
