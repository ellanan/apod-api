  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis kilometer high cliff occurs on the surface of a comet. \n\nIt was discovered on the dark nucleus of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko</a> (CG) by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)\">Rosetta</a>, \na robotic spacecraft \n<a href=\"ap091123.html\">launched</a> by \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>, \nwhich orbited the comet from 2014 to 2016. \n\nThe ragged cliff, as <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/12/Comet_on_10_December_2014_NavCam\">featured</a>  \n<a href=\"https://cumbriansky.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/the-cliffs-of-churyumov-gerasimenko/\">here</a>, was imaged by Rosetta early in its mission.\n\nAlthough towering about one kilometer high, the low surface gravity of \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/12/15/cometwatch-10-december/\">Comet CG</a> would likely make a \n<a href=\"ap140210.html\">jump</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap110404.html\">cliffs</a> by a human survivable. \n\nAt the foot of the cliffs is relatively smooth terrain dotted with \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/10/09/boulder-close-up/\">boulders</a> as large as 20 meters across.\n\nData from \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/farewell-rosetta-esa-mission-to-end-on-comet-surface/\">Rosetta</a> indicates that the ice in \nComet CG has a significantly different \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium\">deuterium</a> fraction -- \nand hence likely a <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_fuels_debate_on_origin_of_Earth_s_oceans\">different origin</a> -- than the water in Earth's oceans. \n\nThe probe was named after the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone\">Rosetta Stone</a>, a rock slab featuring the \nsame text written in three different languages \nthat helped humanity \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/00/84/ce/0084ce9d4e75ac0725816da10f42c2f8.jpg\">decipher</a> ancient Egyptian writing.",
