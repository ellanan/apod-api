  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/wasp-43-b/\">A mere 280 light-years from Earth</a>,\ntidally locked, Jupiter-sized exoplanet WASP-43b\norbits its parent star once every 0.8 Earth days.\n\nThat puts it about 2 million kilometers\n(less than 1/25th the orbital distance of Mercury)\nfrom a small, cool sun.\n\nStill, on a dayside always facing its parent star, temperatures\napproach a torrid 2,500 degrees F as measured at\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-117\">infrared wavelengths by the MIRI</a>\ninstrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/117/01HW67W24KX2ZP8M56MSCG6NDY\">In this illustration</a>\nof the hot exoplanet's orbit, Webb\nmeasurements also show nightside temperatures remain above 1,000 degrees F. \nThat suggests that strong equatorial\nwinds circulate the dayside\natmospheric gases to the nightside before they can completely cool off.\n\nExoplanet WASP-43b is now\n<a href=\"https://wasp-planets.net/tag/wasp-43/\">formally known as</a>\nAstrolábos, and its K-type parent star has been christened Gnomon.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02230-x\">Webb's infrared spectra</a>\nindicate water vapor is present on the nightside as well as\nthe dayside of the planet, providing information about\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-maps-weather-on-planet-280-light-years-away/\">cloud cover on Astrolábos</a>.",
