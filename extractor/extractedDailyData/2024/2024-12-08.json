  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAre Saturn's auroras like Earth's? \n\nTo help answer this question, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/about-the-mission/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> monitored Saturn's North Pole simultaneously during \n<a href=\"ap170125.html\">Cassini's final orbits</a> \naround the gas giant in September 2017. \n\nDuring this time, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/\">Saturn</a>'s tilt caused its North Pole to be \n<a href=\"ap150621.html\">clearly visible</a> from Earth.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1815a/\">featured image</a> is a composite of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet images</a> of auroras and optical images of\n Saturn's clouds and rings, all taken by Hubble.  \n\nLike on Earth, Saturn's northern auroras can make \n<a href=\"ap081119.html\">total or partial rings</a> around the pole.\n\nUnlike on Earth, however, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Saturn#Aurorae\">Saturn's auroras</a> are frequently spirals -- \nand more likely to \n<a href=\"https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1097010202/photo/portrait-of-a-funny-cat-looking-out-of-the-box.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=xhduCYxVsageM8F5_Ot0JFFwB6edgD5pLHoc6gmj3bU=\">peak</a> in brightness just before midnight and dawn. \n\nIn contrast to \n<a href=\"ap220830.html\">Jupiter's auroras</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1815/\">Saturn's auroras</a> appear better related to connecting \nSaturn's internal magnetic field to the nearby, variable, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind\">solar wind</a>. \n\n<a href=\"ap050219.html\">Saturn's southern auroras</a> \nwere similarly imaged back in 2004 when the \n<a href=\"ap050222.html\">planet's South Pole</a> was clearly visible to Earth.",
