  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe tails of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS were a sight to behold.\n\nPictured, C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS) was captured near peak impressiveness last week over the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wMXS2p3Knzk?t=47\">Eastern Sierra</a> Mountains in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>. \n\nThe comet not only showed a \n<a href=\"ap210308.html\">bright tail</a>, but a distinct \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/comet-a3-has-an-anti-tail-can-you-see-it/\">anti-tail</a> pointing in nearly the opposite direction.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/star-clusters-inside-the-universes-stellar-collections/\">globular star</a> cluster \n<a href=\"ap190509.html\">M5</a> can be seen on the right, far in the distance. \n\nAs it approached, it was unclear if this \n<a href=\"ap150203.html\">crumbling iceberg</a> would \n<a href=\"ap230903.html\">disintegrate</a> completely \nas it warmed in the bright sunlight.\n\nIn reality, the comet survived to become brighter than \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars\">any star</a> in the night (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude#List_of_apparent_magnitudes\">magnitude</a> -4.9), but unfortunately was then so \n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/picjumbo.com/wp-content/uploads/dog-with-sunglasses-on-a-paddleboard-free-photo.jpg?w=2210&amp;quality=70\">nearly in front of the Sun</a> that it was hard for many \ncasual observers to locate.\n\nWhether \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=APOD.Sky&amp;set=a.516503464411569\">Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas</a> becomes known as the \n<a href=\"ap220408.html\">Great Comet</a> of 2024 now depends, \nin part, on how impressive \n<a href=\"http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/005400/CBET005453.txt\">incoming</a> comet \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_S1_(ATLAS)\">C/2024 S1 (ATLAS)</a> becomes over the next two weeks.",
