  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWhile hunting for comets in the skies above 18th century France,\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/people/explore-the-night-sky-hubbleatms-messier-catalog-bio/\">astronomer Charles Messier</a>\ndiligently kept a list of the things\nencountered during his telescopic expeditions\nthat were definitely not comets.\n\nThis is number 27 on his\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/history/m-cat.html\">now famous not-a-comet list</a>.\n\nIn fact, 21st century astronomers would identify it as a\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/planetar.html\">planetary\nnebula</a>, but it's not a planet either, even though it may\n<a href=\"ap030614.html\">appear round</a> and\nplanet-like in a small telescope.\n\nMessier 27 (M27) is an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula\ncreated as a <a href=\"ap100221.html\">sun-like star runs out</a>\nof nuclear fuel in its core.\n\nThe nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into\nspace, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying\nstar's intense but invisible\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/\nemspectrum1.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.\n\nKnown by the popular name of the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-27/\">Dumbbell Nebula</a>,\nthe beautifully symmetric interstellar gas cloud\nis over 2.5 light-years across and about 1,200 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vul/index.html\">constellation\nVulpecula</a>.\n\nThis impressive color image highlights details within\nthe well-studied central region and fainter, seldom imaged\nfeatures in the nebula's <a href=\"ap100509.html\">outer halo</a>.",
