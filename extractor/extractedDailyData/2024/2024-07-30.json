  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTo some, it looks like a penguin.\n\nBut to people who study the universe, it is an interesting example of two big galaxies interacting.\n\nJust a few hundred million years ago, the upper NGC 2936 was likely a \n<a href=\"ap130416.html\">normal spiral galaxy</a>: \nspinning, creating stars, and minding its own business. \n\nThen it got too close to the massive \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a> \nNGC 2937, below, and took a dive. \n\nTogether known as <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/124/01J06XYGEDEE86D1H9N5EJ9EG0\">Arp 142</a>, they are \n<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/news/weic2420/\">featured</a> \nin this new \n<a href=\"https://webb.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html\">Webb</a> \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/\">infrared</a> image, while a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/\">visible light</a> \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/\">Hubble</a> \nimage appears in comparison. \n\nNGC 2936 is not only being deflected, but \n<a href=\"ap240320.html\">distorted</a>, by this close gravitational interaction. \n\nWhen massive galaxies \n<a href=\"ap130825.html\">pass near</a> each other, \ngas is typically condensed from which \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/exploring-the-birth-of-stars/\">new stars form</a>. \n\nA <a href=\"https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/group-kittens-are-sitting-together-one-which-is-labeled-as-cat_900958-25003.jpg\">young group</a> of stars appears as the nose of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#/media/File:Penguin_in_Antarctica_jumping_out_of_the_water.jpg\">penguin</a> toward the right of the upper galaxy, while in the center of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral</a>, \nbright stars together appear as an eye. \n\nBefore a billion years, the \n<a href=\"ap220606.html\">two galaxies will likely merge</a> into one larger galaxy.",
