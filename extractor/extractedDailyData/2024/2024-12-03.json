  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could stand on Mars -- what might you see? \n\nYou might look out over a \n<a href=\"ap180404.html\">vast orange landscape</a> covered with rocks under a dusty orange sky, \nwith a blue-tinted \n<a href=\"ap200802.html\">Sun</a> over the horizon, \nand odd-shaped water clouds hovering high overhead.\n\nThis was just \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1108810870821013\">the view</a> captured last March by NASA's rolling explorer,  \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/\">Perseverance</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/69-Why-is-Mars-reddish\">orange coloring</a> is caused by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust\">rusted</a> iron in the Martian dirt, \nsome of which is small enough to be \n<a href=\"ap231107.html\">swept up by winds</a> into the atmosphere.\n\nThe blue tint near the rising Sun is caused by \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/\">blue light</a> being preferentially scattered out from the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> by the floating dust.\n\nThe light-colored clouds on the right are likely composed of \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/mars-water-ice-clouds-are-key-to-odd-thermal-rhythm/\">water-ice</a> and appear high in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars\">Martian atmosphere</a>. \n\nThe shapes of some of these clouds are \n<a href=\"https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/scared-surprised-cat-face.jpg\">unusual</a> for Earth and remain a topic of research.",
