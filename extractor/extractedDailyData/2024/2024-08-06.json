  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat makes this storm cloud so colorful? \n\nFirst, the \n<a href=\"https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/\">cloud</a> itself is composed of millions of tiny droplets of water and ice. \n\nIts bottom is almost completely flat -- but this isn't unusual. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-01/flat-bottom-clouds-and-the-science-behind-them/12591230\">Bottom flatness in clouds</a> is generally caused by \n<a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/interactives/atmosphere-altitude/vertpro_comet.jpg\">air temperature</a> \ndropping as you go up, and that above a specific height, \nwater-saturated air condenses out water droplets. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap040218.html\">shape of the cloud</a> \nmiddle is caused by a \nwater-droplet-laden column of air being blown upward. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.seadna.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hilariously-Surprised-Dogs.jpg\">Most unusual</a>, though, are the orange and yellow colors. \n\nBoth <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/clouds/color-of-clouds\">colors are caused</a> by the cloud's water drops reflecting sunlight.\n\nThe orange color in the cloud's middle and bottom \nsections are reflections of a nearly \n<a href=\"ap170120.html\">red sunset</a>. \n\nIn contrast, the yellow color of the cloud's top results from \n<a href=\"ap180613.html\">reflection of light from a not-yet-setting Sun</a>,\nwhere some -- but less -- \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">blue light is being scattered away</a>.\n\nAppearing to \n<a href=\"ap230514.html\">float above</a> the plains in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CO_y-rKhqhK/\">featured impressive image</a> of a dynamic \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud\">cumulonimbus cloud</a> was \n<a href=\"https://laurarowe.smugmug.com/About-Laura-Rowe\">captured in 2021</a> while investigating a \n<a href=\"ap200517.html\">tornado</a>.",
