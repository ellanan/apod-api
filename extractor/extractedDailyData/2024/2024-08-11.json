  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere do Perseid meteors come from?\n\nMostly small bits of stony grit, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/\">Perseid meteoroids</a> were once expelled from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a> and continue to follow this comet's orbit as they slowly disperse.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/Perseids\">featured animation</a> depicts the entire meteoroid stream as it orbits \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">our Sun</a>. \n\nWhen the Earth nears this stream, as it does every year, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a> occurs. \n\nHighlighted as bright in the animation, \n<a href=\"ap240106.html\">comet debris</a> \nthis size is usually so dim it is practically undetectable. \n\nOnly a small fraction of this debris will enter the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, heat up and \n<a href=\"ap011118.html\">disintegrate brightly</a>. \n\nTonight and the next few nights promise some of the better skies to view \nthe <a href=\"ap170818.html\">Perseid shower</a> \nas well as <a href=\"http://cams.seti.org/FDL/\">other active showers</a> \nbecause the \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/54/phases-of-the-moon/\">first quarter moon</a> will be \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FindTheSniper/comments/1chffk6/find_the_cat/\">absent</a> from \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/\">the sky</a> from \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-perseid-meteor-shower/\">midnight onward</a>.",
