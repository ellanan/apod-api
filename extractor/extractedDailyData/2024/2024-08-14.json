  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis was an unusual night.\n\nFor one thing, the night sky of August 11 and 12, \nearlier this week, occurred near the peak of the annual \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a>.\n\nTherefore, meteors streaked across the \ndark night as small bits cast off from \n<a href=\"ap960219.html\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a> came crashing into the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.\n\nEven more unusually, for central \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a> \nat least, the night \n<a href=\"ap240612.html\">sky glowed purple</a>.\n\nThe red-blue hue was due to aurora caused by an \n<a href=\"ap180902.html\">explosion of particles</a> from the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> a few days before.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/severe-g4-geomagnetic-storms-observed-12-aug-2024\">This auroral storm</a> was so intense that it \nwas seen as far south as \n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=211318\">Texas</a> and \n<a href=\"https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=211357\">Italy</a>, in Earth's northern hemisphere. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-k4uM-NtSP/\">featured image</a> composite was built from 7 exposures \ntaken over 26 minutes from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/7SylqzpjQfA\">Ense</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>.\n\nThe Perseids occur \n<a href=\"https://mrwallpaper.com/images/high/cute-yet-bored-funny-cat-e2ftbgrfxrbazqsb.webp\">predictably</a> every August, \nbut auroras visible this far south are more unusual and less predictable.",
