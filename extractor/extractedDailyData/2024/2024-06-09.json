  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is that light in the sky?\n\nThe answer to one of humanity's more common questions \nmay emerge from a few quick observations. \n\nFor example -- is it moving or blinking?\n\nIf so, and if you live near a \n<a href=\"ap200624.html\">city</a>, \nthe answer is typically an airplane, \nsince planes are so numerous and so few stars and \n<a href=\"ap080604.html\">satellites</a> are bright enough \nto be seen over the glare of \n<a href=\"https://darksky.org/what-we-do/international-dark-sky-places/\">artificial city lights</a>.\n\nIf not, and if you live far from a city, that bright light is likely a planet such as \n<a href=\"ap210317.html\">Venus</a> or \n<a href=\"ap180709.html\">Mars</a> -- \nthe former of which is constrained to appear near the horizon just before dawn or after dusk. \n\nSometimes the low apparent motion of a distant \n<a href=\"ap190212.html\">airplane</a> near the horizon makes it hard to tell from a \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/space/why-dont-planets-twinkle-as-stars-do\">bright planet</a>, \nbut even this can usually be discerned by the plane's motion over a few minutes.\n\n<a href=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/9uuqXXT7VYo/hqdefault.jpg\">Still unsure?</a>   \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.leagueoflostcauses.com/blog/2013/08/astronomy-101.html\">featured chart</a> gives a sometimes-humorous but mostly-accurate assessment. \n\nDedicated sky enthusiasts will likely note -- and are \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=211114\">encouraged to provide</a> -- polite corrections.",
