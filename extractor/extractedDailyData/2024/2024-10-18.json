  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn October 14 it was hard to capture a full view of\nComet C/2023 A3\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-climbs-brightens-and-delights/\">Tsuchinshan-ATLAS</a>.\n\nTaken after the comet's closest approach to our fair planet,\n<a href=\"https://www.adamblockphotos.com/c2023-a3-2024-10-14.html\">this evening skyview almost does though</a>.\n\nWith two telephoto frames combined, the image stretches about 26 degrees\nacross the sky from top to bottom,\nlooking west from Gates Pass, Tucson, Arizona.\n\nComet watchers that night could even\n<a href=\"image/2410/olbersM5detail.jpg\">identify</a>\nglobular star cluster M5\nand the faint apparition of periodic comet 13P Olbers near the\nlong the path of Tsuchinshan-ATLAS's whitish dust tail\nabove the bright comet's coma.\n\n<a href=\"ap230127.html\">Due to perspective</a>\nas the Earth is crossing the comet's orbital plane,\nTsuchinshan-ATLAS also has a pronounced antitail.\n\nThe antitail is composed of dust previously released\nand fanning out away from the Sun along the comet's orbit,\nvisible as a needle-like extension below the bright coma toward\nthe rugged western horizon.",
