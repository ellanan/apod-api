  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow far can black hole jets extend?\n\nA \n<a href=\"https://www.keckobservatory.org/porphyrion/\">new record was found</a> \njust recently with the discovery of a 23-million \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/\">light-year</a> long jet pair from a black hole active billions of years ago. \n\nDubbed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrion\">Porphyrion</a> for a mythological Greek giant, \nthe impressive jets were created by a type of \n<a href=\"ap240507.html\">black hole</a> that does not usually create long jets -- \none that is busy creating radiation from infalling gas.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VYjCQ--wEVk\">featured animated video</a> \ndepicts what it might look like to circle around this powerful \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/\">black hole</a> \nsystem. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/science/space/black-hole-m87-energy.html\">Porphyrion</a> is shown as a fast stream of \n<a href=\"https://www.iar.unlp.edu.ar/biblio/htdocs/artic/contri/1610.pdf\">energetic particles</a>, \nand the bright areas are where these particles are \nimpacting surrounding gas.\n\nThe discovery was made using data from the \n<a href=\"https://www.keckobservatory.org/\">Keck</a> and \n<a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/nicholas-mayall-4m-telescope/\">Mayall</a>  \n(<a href=\"https://www.desi.lbl.gov/DESI\">DESI</a>) \noptical observatories as well as \n<a href=\"https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/en/lofar\">LOFAR</a>\nand the \n<a href=\"http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/gmrt\">Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope</a>. \n\nThe existence of \n<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/science/massive-black-hole-jets-porphyrion/index.html\">these jets</a> demonstrates that \nblack holes can affect not only their \n<a href=\"ap030501.html\">home galaxies</a> but \n<a href=\"https://wallpapers.com/images/featured/galaxy-cat-kyz6xesjaq5wq8y2.jpg\">far out</a> into the surrounding \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-the-universe/\">universe</a>.",
