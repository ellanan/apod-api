  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFound among the rich starfields of the Milky Way,\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n7789.html\">star\ncluster NGC 7789</a> lies about 8,000 light-years away\ntoward the constellation Cassiopeia.\n\nA late 18th century deep sky discovery of astronomer\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/in-caroline-herschels-footsteps/\">Caroline Lucretia Herschel</a>,\nthe cluster is also known as Caroline's Rose.\n\nIts\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/explore-caroline-herschels-celestial-showpieces/\">visual appearance</a>\nin small telescopes, created by\nthe cluster's complex of stars and voids,\nis suggestive of nested rose petals.\n\nNow estimated to be 1.6 billion years young, the\ngalactic or open\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/universe-uncovered/hubble-star-clusters/\">cluster of stars</a>\nalso shows its age.\n\nAll the stars in the cluster were likely born\nat the same time, but the brighter and more massive ones have more\nrapidly exhausted the hydrogen fuel in their\ncores.\n\nThese have evolved from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence\">main sequence</a>\nstars like the Sun into the many red giant stars shown with a \nyellowish cast in this color composite.\n\nUsing measured <a href=\"ap010223.html\">color and brightness</a>,\nastronomers can model the mass and hence the age of\nthe cluster stars just starting to \"turn off\" the main sequence\nand become <a href=\"ap110408.html\">red giants</a>.\n\nOver 50 light-years across,\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu//full/1848MNRAS...8...64./\n0000064.000.html\">Caroline's Rose</a> spans about\nhalf a degree (the angular size of the Moon) near the center of\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/4qk8jq/0/\">the sharp telescopic image</a>.",
