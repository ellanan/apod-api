  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAre these two galaxies really attracted to each other?\n\nYes, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity\">gravitationally</a>, and the result appears as an \n<a href=\"ap220214.html\">enormous</a> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_symbol\">iconic heart</a> -- at least for now.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.kentbiggs.com/images/galaxies/N4038.htm\">Pictured</a> is the pair of galaxies cataloged as \n<a href=\"ap180523.html\">NGC 4038</a> and NGC 4039,known as the \n<a href=\"ap220331.html\">Antennae Galaxies</a>. \n\nBecause they are only 60 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light years</a> away, close by \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">intergalactic standards</a>, \nthe pair is one of the best studied \n<a href=\"ap191120.html\">interacting galaxies</a> on the night sky.\n\nTheir \n<a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travelling-cuddling-stray-cats-istanbul-orin-fb12-png__700.jpg\">strong attraction</a> \nbegan about a billion years ago \nwhen they passed unusually close to each other. \n\nAs the two \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/\">galaxies</a> interact, their \n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/\">stars</a> rarely collide, but new stars are \nformed when their interstellar gases crash together. \n\nSome new stars have already formed, for example, in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(biology)#/media/File:Rosalia_alpina_side.JPG\">long antennae</a> seen extending out from the sides of the dancing duo.\n\nBy the time the \n<a href=\"http://astronomyonline.org/Cosmology/GalaxyMergers.asp\">galaxy merger</a> is complete, likely over a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future\">billion years from now</a>, billions of new stars may have formed.",
