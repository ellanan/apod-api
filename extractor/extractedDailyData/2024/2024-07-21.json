  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis rock structure is not only surreal -- it's real. \n\nPerhaps the reason it's not more famous is that it is \nsmaller than one might guess: the capstone rock overhangs only a \n<a href=\"https://liveloveruntravel.com/king-of-wings-new-mexico/\">few meters</a>. \n\nEven so, the \n<a href=\"https://www.summitpost.org/king-of-wings/1010769\">King of Wings</a> outcrop, located in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico\">New Mexico</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/\">USA</a>, is a fascinating example of an unusual type of rock structure called a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)\">hoodoo</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap200813.html\">Hoodoo</a>s may \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)#Formation\">form</a> when a layer of hard rock overlays a layer of \n<a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/erosion/\">eroding</a> \nsofter rock.\n\nFiguring out the details of incorporating \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/OcWAkbG_YLo\">this hoodoo</a> \ninto a night-sky photoshoot took over a year.\n\nBesides \n<a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/funny-cat-tired-boring-lying-260nw-1447517609.jpg\">waiting for a suitably picturesque night</a> \nbehind a sky with few clouds, the foreground had to be \n<a href=\"ap230308.html\">artificially lit</a> \njust right relative to the \n<a href=\"https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/news-display.cfm?News_ID=745\">natural glow</a> of the background. \n\nAfter much planning and waiting, the final shot, \n<a href=\"http://waynepinkstonphoto.com/WhatsNew/i-Trxjrp7/A\">featured here</a>, \nwas taken in May 2016.\n\nMimicking the horizontal bar, the background sky features the band of our \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> stretching overhead.",
