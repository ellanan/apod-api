  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes a river of hot gas flows over your head.\n\nIn this case the river created a \nStrong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEVE\">STEVE</a>) \nthat glowed bright red, white, and pink.\n\nDetails of <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018GeoRL..45.7968G/abstract\">how STEVEs work</a> remain a topic of research, but recent evidence holds that their glow results from a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEVE#Research_into_cause\">fast-moving river of hot ions</a> \nflowing over a hundred kilometers up in the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>: the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/10-things-to-know-about-the-ionosphere/\">ionosphere</a>.\n\nThe more expansive dull red glow might be related to the flowing \n<a href=\"ap210505.html\">STEVE</a>, but alternatively might be a \n<a href=\"https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2021/11/22/3308/\">Stable Auroral Red</a> (SAR) arc, a \n<a href=\"ap240103.html\">more</a> general heat-related glow.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBKEFJlMLPo/\">featured picture</a>, taken earlier this month in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/66ATFjFDjoY?t=129\">Côte d'Opale</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France\">France</a>, \nis a wide-angle digital composite made as the \n<a href=\"ap171014.html\">STEVE arc</a> formed nearly overhead. \n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"ap231022.html\">apparition</a> lasted only a few minutes, \nthis was long enough for the \n<a href=\"https://static2.bigstockphoto.com/0/7/4/large1500/470325001.jpg\">quick-thinking</a> astrophotographer to get in the picture -- \ncan you find him?",
