  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThere is a\n<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aao7228\">quiet pulsar</a>\nat the heart of CTA 1.\n\nThe supernova remnant was\n<a href=\"https://www.deepskycorner.ch/obj/cta1.en.php\">discovered</a> as a\nsource of emission\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves/\">at radio wavelengths</a>\nby astronomers in 1960\nand since identified as the result of the\ndeath explosion of a massive star.\n\nBut no radio pulses were detected from the expected pulsar, the\n<a href=\"ap240723.html\">rotating neutron star</a>\nremnant of the massive star's collapsed core.\n\nSeen about 10,000 years after the initial supernova explosion,\nthe interstellar debris cloud is faint at optical wavelengths.\n\nCTA 1's visible wavelength\nemission from still expanding shock fronts is revealed in\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/3vfxec/0/\">this deep telescopic image</a>,\na frame that spans about 2 degrees across a\nstarfield in the northern constellation of Cepheus.\n\nWhile no pulsar has since been found at radio wavelengths,\nin 2008 the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/fermi\">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a>\ndetected pulsed emission from CTA 1,\nidentifying the supernova remnant's\nrotating neutron star.\n\nThe source has been recognized as the first\nin a growing class of pulsars that are quiet at radio wavelengths but\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/goddard/nasas-fermi-telescope-discovers-first-gamma-ray-only-pulsar/\">pulse in high-energy gamma-rays</a>.",
