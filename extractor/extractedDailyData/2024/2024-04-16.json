  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe explosion is over, but the consequences continue. \n\nAbout eleven thousand years ago, a star in the constellation of \n<a href=\"ap190110.html\">Vela</a> could be seen to \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY\">explode</a>, \ncreating a strange point of light briefly visible to \nhumans living near the beginning of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting\">recorded history</a>. \n\nThe outer layers of the star crashed into the \n<a href=\"ap130924.html\">interstellar medium</a>, driving a \n<a href=\"ap210414.html\">shock wave</a> that is still visible today. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noirlab2406a/\">featured image</a> \ncaptures some of that filamentary and gigantic shock in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/\">visible light</a>.\n\nAs gas flies away from the detonated star, it \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/observatories/satellite/compton/snr.html\">decays</a> and reacts with the interstellar medium, \nproducing light in many different colors and energy bands.\n\nRemaining at the center of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Supernova_Remnant\">Vela Supernova Remnant</a> is a \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/neutron_stars1.html\">pulsar</a>, a star as dense as nuclear matter that \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jv2rEa7iqhA\">spins around</a> \nmore than ten times in a single second.",
