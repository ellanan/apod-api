  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow was the Crescent Nebula created? \n\nLooking like an emerging space \n<a href=\"ap231224.html\">cocoon</a>, the Crescent Nebula, \nvisible in the center of the \n<a href=\"https://astroaro.fr/en/en_ngc-6888/\">featured image</a>, was created by the brightest star in its center.  \n\nA leading progenitor hypothesis has the \n<a href=\"ap230904.html\">Crescent Nebula</a> \nbeginning to form about 250,000 years ago.  \n\nAt that time, the massive central star had evolved to become a \n<a href=\"ap200308.html\">Wolf-Rayet star</a> (WR 136), \nshedding its outer envelope in a strong \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\">stellar wind</a>, ejecting the equivalent of our \nSun's mass every 10,000 years. \n\nThis wind impacted surrounding gas left over from a \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/redsup.html\">previous phase</a>, compacting it into a series of \n<a href=\"ap240107.html\">complex shells</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://delavanlakesvet.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/195/2022/03/smiling-cat-for-web.jpg\">lighting it up</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AJ....119.2991M/abstract\">Crescent Nebula</a>, also known as NGC 6888, lies about 4,700 \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/\">light-year</a>s away in the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)\">Cygnus</a>. \n\nStar <a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/w/wolf-rayet+star\">WR</a> 136 \nwill probably undergo a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY\">supernova</a> \nexplosion sometime in the next million years.",
