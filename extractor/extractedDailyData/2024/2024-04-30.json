  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe star system GK Per is known to be associated \nwith only two of the three nebulas \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/ocm8rv/\">pictured</a>. \n\nAt 1500 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light years</a> distant, \nNova Persei 1901 \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GK_Persei\">GK Persei</a>) \nwas the second closest \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova\">nova</a> yet recorded.\n\nAt the very center is a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/types/#white-dwarfs\">white dwarf star</a>, the surviving core of a former Sun-like star.\n\nIt is surrounded by the circular \n<a href=\"ap980704.html\">Firework nebula</a>, gas that was ejected by a \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/11e8XyUBqRQ\">thermonuclear explosion</a> \non the white dwarf's surface -- a nova -- as \n<a href=\"https://www.aavso.org/vsots_gkper\">recorded in 1901</a>.\n\nThe red glowing gas surrounding the Firework nebula \nis the atmosphere that used to surround the central star.\n\nThis gas was expelled before the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zYmd8EETy74\">nova</a> and appears as a diffuse \n<a href=\"ap230416.html\">planetary nebula</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://deepskycollective.com/gkpersei/lrgbhoo\">faint gray gas</a> running across is \n<a href=\"https://www.cosmotography.com/images/galactic_cirrus.html\">interstellar cirrus</a> that seems to be \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10332\">just passing through</a> \ncoincidently.\n\nIn 1901, GK Per's nova \n<a href=\"https://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/BGR_News/scared-surprised-cat-face.jpg\">became brighter</a> than \n<a href=\"ap200511.html\">Betelgeuse</a>.\n\nSimilarly, star system \n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2024/02/27/view-nova-explosion-new-star-in-northern-crown/\">T CrB</a> is expected to \nerupt in a nova later this year, \nbut we don't know exactly when nor \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Coronae_Borealis\">how bright</a> it will become.",
