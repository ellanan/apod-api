  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis popular group leaps into the early evening sky around the March\nequinox and\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-vernal-or-spring-equinox\">the northern hemisphere spring</a>.\n \nFamous as the\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/more/m066gr.html\">Leo Triplet</a>,\nthe three magnificent galaxies found in the prominent\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/leo-heres-your-constellation\">constellation Leo</a>\ngather here in one astronomical field of view.\n\nCrowd pleasers when imaged with even modest\ntelescopes, they can be introduced individually as\nNGC 3628 (left), M66 (bottom right), and M65 (top).\n\nAll three are large\n<a href=\"http://cass.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/Galaxies.html\">spiral galaxies</a> but\ntend to look dissimilar, because their galactic disks are\ntilted at different angles to our line of sight.\n\n<a href=\"ap140508.html\">NGC 3628</a>,\nalso known as the Hamburger Galaxy,\nis temptingly seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes\ncutting across its puffy galactic plane.\n\nThe disks\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-66/\">of M66</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-65/\">M65 are</a>\nboth inclined enough to show off their spiral structure. \n\nGravitational interactions between galaxies in the group\nhave left telltale signs, including the tidal tails and\nwarped, inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.starrywonders.com/leotripletasi294small.html\">This gorgeous view</a>\nof the region spans over 1 degree (two full moons) on the sky\nin a frame that covers over half a million light-years at the\ntrio's estimated distance of 30 million light-years.",
