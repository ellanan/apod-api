  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe new comet has passed its closest to the Sun and is now moving closer to the Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS)\">C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS)</a> is currently moving out from inside the orbit of \n<a href=\"ap210317.html\">Venus</a> and on track to \n<a href=\"ap200504.html\">pass</a> its nearest to the \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">Earth</a> in about two weeks. \n\nComet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/babaktafreshi/p/DAOfV4tPaCe/\">pronounced \"Choo-cheen-shahn At-less,\"</a>, is near naked-eye \nvisibility and easily picked up by long-exposure cameras. \n\nThe comet can also now be found by observers in \nEarth's northern hemisphere as well as the south. \n\nThe featured image was captured just a few days ago above \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JiIIAFeW56E\">Zacatecas</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\">Mexico</a>.\n\nBecause clouds were obscuring much of the pre-dawn sky, \nthe astrophotographer released a \n<a href=\"https://www.ctia.org/news/up-up-and-away-how-do-drones-work\">drone</a> to take pictures from higher up, \nseveral of which were later merged to enhance the comet's visibility.\n\nAlthough the future brightness of comets is \n<a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/small-gray-cat-lies-on-600nw-2165991979.jpg\">hard to predict</a>, there is increasing hope that \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/c2023a3-info\">Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS</a> \nwill further brighten as it enters the early evening sky.",
