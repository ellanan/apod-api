  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does a supernova remnant sound like?\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"https://method-behind-the-music.com/mechanics/physics/\">sound</a> is a compression wave in matter and does not carry into \n<a href=\"ap151206.html\">empty space</a>, \n<a href=\"ap201216.html\">interpretive sound</a> \ncan help listeners appreciate and \nunderstand a visual image of a <a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/supernova_remnants.html\">supernova remnant</a> in a new way.\n\nRecently, the Jellyfish Nebula \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_443\">IC 443</a>) \nhas been sonified quite creatively. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2024/sonify8/\">featured sound-enhanced video</a>, \nwhen an imaginary line passes over a star, \n<a href=\"https://plus.nasa.gov/video/listen-to-the-universe/\">the sound</a> of a drop falling into water is played, \na sound particularly relevant to the nebula's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish\">aquatic namesake</a>. \n\nAdditionally, when the descending line crosses gas that glows red, \na low <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tone\" :=\"\">tone</a> is played, while green sounds a middle tone, \nand blue produces a tone with a relatively high \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)\">pitch</a>.\n\nLight from the supernova that created the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ysZK_tNeh38\">Jellyfish Nebula</a> \nleft approximately 35,000 years ago, when \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">human</a>ity was in the \n<a href=\"https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4261235446_1ab55b702b_o.png\">stone age</a>. \n\nThe nebula will slowly disperse over the next million years, \nalthough the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY\">explosion</a> \nalso created a dense \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/neutron-stars-are-weird/\">neutron star</a> which will remain indefinitely.",
