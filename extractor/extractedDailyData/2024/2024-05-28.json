  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's back.\n\nThe famous active region on the Sun that created \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.431368006258449&amp;type=3\">auroras visible</a> around the Earth \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms\">earlier this month</a> \nhas survived its rotation around the far side of the Sun -- and returned. \n\nYesterday, as it was beginning to reappear on the Earth-facing side, \nthe region formerly labeled \n<a href=\"ap240511.html\">AR 3664</a> \nthrew another \n<a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/x28-flare-old-region-3664\">major solar flare</a>, again in the highest-energy \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10109/\">X-class</a> range.\n\nThe featured video shows the emerging <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/get-involved/citizen-science/be-a-solar-active-region-spotter/\">active region</a> \non the lower left, as it was captured by NASA's Earth-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> \nyesterday in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/\">ultraviolet light</a>.\n\nThe video is a time-lapse of the entire \n<a href=\"ap200819.html\">Sun rotating</a> over 24 hours.  \n\nWatch the lower-left region carefully at \nabout the 2-second mark to see the powerful \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/space-weather/solar-flares/what-is-a-solar-flare/\">flare</a> burst out.\n\nThe energetic particles from that flare and \n<a href=\"https://spaceweather.com/images2024/27may24/farsidecme.gif\">associated CME</a> are not expected to directly \nimpact the Earth and trigger impressive auroras, but scientists will keep a \n<a href=\"https://www.mediastorehouse.com/p/617/tabby-kitten-looking-pot-plant-9446207.jpg.webp\">close watch</a> on this unusually \n<a href=\"https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=28&amp;month=05&amp;year=2024\">active region</a> over the next two weeks, \nas it faces the Earth, to see what develops.",
