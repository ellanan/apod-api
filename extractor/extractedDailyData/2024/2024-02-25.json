  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAll of the other aurora watchers had gone home.\n\nBy 3:30 am in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a>, \non a quiet September night, much of that night's auroras had died down.\n\nSuddenly, unexpectedly, a new burst of particles streamed down from space, lighting up the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> once again.\n\nThis time, surprisingly, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia\">pareidolia</a>cally, \nthe night lit up with an  \n<a href=\"ap140429.html\">amazing</a> \n<a href=\"ap121003.html\">shape</a> reminiscent of a giant \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)\">phoenix</a>.\n\nWith camera equipment at the ready, two quick sky images were taken, \nfollowed immediately by a third of the land. \n\nThe mountain in the background is \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BuhpUn0LsE\">Helgafell</a>, \nwhile the small foreground river is called Kaldá, \nboth located about 30 kilometers north of Iceland's capital \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-5exa7svE5Y\">Reykjavík</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7071/7180595308_f6ba60d0b8_b.jpg\">Seasoned skywatchers</a> \nwill note that just above the mountain, toward the left, is the \n<a href=\"ap101117.html\">constellation of Orion</a>, while the \n<a href=\"ap140225.html\">Pleiades</a> \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18009\">star cluster</a> is also visible just above the frame center. \n\nThe 2016 <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/\">aurora</a>, \nwhich lasted only a minute and was soon gone forever --  \nwould possibly be dismissed as a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_tale\">fanciful fable</a> -- were it not captured in the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Icelandic.Photos/photos/pb.1859684057503918.-2207520000.1458064624./2130278890444432/\">featured, digitally-composed, image mosaic</a>.",
