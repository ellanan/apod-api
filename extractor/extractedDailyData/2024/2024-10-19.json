  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThese six panels follow daily apparitions of comet\n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/c2023a3-info\">C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS</a>\nas it moved away from our\nfair planet during the past week.\n\nThe images were taken with the same camera and lens at the\nindicated dates and locations from California, planet Earth.\n\nAt far right on October 12\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153444/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-arrives-from-afar\">the visitor</a>\nfrom the distant Oort cloud\nwas near its closest approach, some 70 million kilometers (about 4\nlight-minutes) away.\n\nIts bright coma and long dust tail were \nclose on the sky to the setting Sun but still easy to spot against\na bright western horizon.\n\nOver the following days, the outbound comet steadily climbs\nabove the ecliptic and north\ninto the darker western evening sky, but begins to fade from view.\n\nCrossing the Earth's orbital plane around October 14,\nTsuchinshan-ATLAS exhibits a noticeable\n<a href=\"ap241018.html\">antitail</a> extended toward the western horizon.\n\nHigher in the evening sky at sunset by October 17 (far left)\nthe comet has faded and reached a distance of around 77 million\nkilometers from planet Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-climbs-brightens-and-delights/\">Hopefully you enjoyed</a>\nsome of Tsuchinshan-ATLAS's bid to become\nthe best comet of 2024.\n\n<a href=\"https://planetarium.wvu.edu/mountaineer-skies-blog/2024/10/11/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas\">This comet's</a>\ninitial orbital period estimates were a mere 80,000 years, but\n<a href=\"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=C%2F2023%20A3&amp;view=OPC\">in fact</a>\nit may never return to the inner Solar System.",
