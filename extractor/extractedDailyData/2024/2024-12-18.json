  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat kind of strange galaxy is this?\n\nThis rare structure is known as a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar-ring_galaxy\">polar ring galaxy</a>, and it seems to have two different rings of stars. \n\nIn this galaxy, \n<a href=\"ap141108.html\">NGC 660</a>, one ring of bright stars, \ngas, and dark dust appears nearly vertical, \nwhile another similar but shorter ring runs diagonally from the upper left. \n\nHow polar ring galaxies \n<a href=\"ap231024.html\">obtain</a> their striking appearance remains a \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/68/54/15/685415485a101db87fa6023548eec83f.jpg\">topic of research</a>, but a leading theory \nholds that it is usually the result of two galaxies \nwith different central ring planes \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">colliding</a>. \n\nNGC 660 spans about 50,000 light years and is located about 40 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/\">light years</a> \naway toward the constellation of the Fish \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation)\">Pisces</a>). \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://throughlightandtime.com/ngc-660-lrgb-rev-1-crop-cdk-1000-22-nov-2024-2/\">featured image</a> was captured recently from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/S4rFdr2Qmjk\">Observatorio El Sauce</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.",
