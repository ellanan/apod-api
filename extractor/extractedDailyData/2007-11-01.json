  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA cosmic bridge of stars, gas, and dust stretches\nfor over 75,000 light-years and joins this\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html\">peculiar</a>\npair of galaxies\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2007/36/\nindex.html\">cataloged as Arp 87</a>.\n\nThe bridge is strong evidence\nthat these two immense star systems have\n<a href=\"ap020506.html\">passed close</a> to each other\nand experienced violent tides induced by\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/main.html\">mutual\ngravity</a>.\n\nAs further evidence, the face-on spiral galaxy on\nthe right, also known as NGC 3808A,\nexhibits many young blue star clusters produced in a burst\nof star formation.\n\nThe twisted edge-on spiral on the left (NGC 3808B) seems to be wrapped\nin the material <a href=\"ap061111.html\">bridging the galaxies</a> and\nsurrounded by a curious\n<a href=\"ap070216.html\">polar ring</a>.\n\nWhile such interactions are drawn out over billions of years, repeated\n<a href=\"http://www.npaci.edu/online/v4.9/galaxies2.html\">close\npassages</a> should ultimately result in\nthe merger of this pair of galaxies into a larger single\ngalaxy of stars.\n\nAlthough\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?\nbibcode=1972ApJ...178..623T&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=3c862d41db22593\">this\nscenario</a> does look peculiar, galactic mergers are thought\nto be common, with Arp 87 representing a stage in\n<a href=\"http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jhibbard/MergeSeq/mergeseq.html\">this\ninevitable process</a>.\n\nThe Arp 87 pair are\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/36/\nfastfacts/\">about 300 million light-years</a>\ndistant toward the constellation Leo.\n\nThe prominent edge-on spiral at the far left\nappears to be a more distant background galaxy and\nnot involved in the on-going merger.",
