  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs star AE Aurigae on fire?  \n\nAlthough surrounded by what may look like \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/question43.htm\">smoke</a>, the object known as the \"flaming star\" \ncreates energy primarily by \n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart.html\">nuclear fusion</a>, like other stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=fire\">Fire</a>, typically defined as the rapid molecular acquisition of \n<a href=\"http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/O/key.html\">oxygen</a>, happens only when sufficient \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/8.html\">oxygen</a> is present and is not important in such high-energy, \nlow-oxygen environments such as stars.  \n\nThe material that appears as smoke is mostly \n<a href=\"ap010113.html\">interstellar hydrogen</a>, but does \ncontain smoke-like dark filaments of carbon-rich \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust grains</a>.  \n\nThe AE <a href=\"http://www3.pei.sympatico.ca/brian.gorveatt/auriga.html\">Aurigae</a> region was imaged by the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/kpno/\">KPNO</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/0.9m/manual.html\">0.9-meter telescope</a> and is \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0686.html\">shown above</a> in false but representative colors.  \n\nThe star \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999PASP..111..809H\">AE Aurigae</a> itself is very bright, young, blue, \nand known as a \n<a href=\"ap971203.html\">runaway star</a> \nsince it appears to have been ejected from the \n<a href=\"ap010130.html\">Orion Nebula</a> \nregion about 2.7 million years ago.",
