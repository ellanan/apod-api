  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOne of the most spectacular solar sights is an erupting prominence.\n\nIn 2011, NASA's Sun-orbiting\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sdo\">Solar Dynamic Observatory</a> spacecraft imaged an\n<a href=\"ap030223.html\">impressively large prominence</a>\nerupting from the surface.\n\nThe dramatic explosion was captured in ultraviolet light in the\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/PBL1RBj-P1g\">featured time lapse video</a> covering 90 minutes, where a \nnew frame was taken every 24 seconds.  \n\nThe scale of the prominence is huge -- the entire <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a> would easily fit under the flowing  \n<a href=\"ap011203.html\">curtain</a> of hot gas.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Program/hfilament.html\">solar prominence</a> is channeled and sometimes held above the\nSun's surface by the Sun's\n<a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml\">magnetic field</a>.\n\nA quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month and may erupt in a\n<a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml\">Coronal Mass Ejection</a> (CME)\n<a href=\"ap010924.html\">expelling hot gas</a> into the\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nThe energy \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...343..971V/abstract\">mechanism</a> that creates a\n<a href=\"ap030707.html\">solar prominence</a> is a continuing topic of\n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/62/75/3062756a297f1e3c22e35f3fe89b3ecc.jpg\">research</a>.  \n\nOur Sun is again near \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/solar-cycle-25-is-here-nasa-noaa-scientists-explain-what-that-means/\">solar maximum</a> and so very active, \nfeaturing numerous erupting prominences and CMEs, one of which resulted in \n<a href=\"ap240814.html\">picturesque</a> \n<a href=\"ap240815.html\">auroras</a> just over the past week.",
