  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere is NASA's rover Curiosity going on Mars?\n\nIts geographical goals are on the slopes of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sharp\">Mount Sharp</a>, whose \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1906\">peak is seen</a> in the background on the right. \n\nA key <a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/objectives/\">scientific goal</a>, however, remains to better assess when and where conditions on Mars were once suitable for life, in particular microbial life. \n\nTo further this goal, \n<a href=\"ap150329.html\">Curiosity</a> was directed to cross the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI69jN_P3IA\">rugged terrain</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6452\">Nautkluft Plateau</a>, visible in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20332\">featured image</a> on the foreground left. \n\n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/\">Curiosity is</a> crossing toward smoother uphill sites with rocks containing \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite#Mars\">hematite</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703706020114\">sulfates</a>, sites that could give the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)\">rolling rover</a> new clues on how long this part of Mars was wet -- and hence more favorable for life -- before \n<a href=\"http://f.tqn.com/y/dogs/1/L/J/H/0/-/dog-food-bowls-10175581-resized.jpg\">drying out</a>. \n\nOf recent concern, however, is \n<a href=\"ap130603.html\">Curiosity's aluminum wheels</a>, which are showing increasing \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20334\">signs of wear</a>. \n\nAlthough already \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4734\">fulfilling the goals</a> \nof its two year study, Curiosity's mission has been \n<a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/files/msl/2014-MSL-extended-mission-plan.pdf\">extended</a> as it continues to uncover valuable information about the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Mars\">extraordinary past of Mars</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap150512.html\">next planet out</a> from the Sun from Earth.",
