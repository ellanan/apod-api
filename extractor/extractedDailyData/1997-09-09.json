  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMany think it is just a myth.  \nOthers think it is true but its cause isn't known.  \nAdventurers pride themselves on having seen it.  It's a <a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/StarDateDB.FM$RETRIEVE?value=03/31/1995&amp;field=ScriptAirDate&amp;html=Test+Request+Date\">green flash</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a>.  \nThe truth is the \n<a href=\"http://www.eastnc.coastalnet.com/weather/nwsmhx/sky.htm\">green flash</a> does exist and its cause is well understood.  \nJust as the setting \n<a href=\"lib/sun.html\">Sun</a> disappears completely from view, \na last glimmer appears startlingly green.  \nThe effect is typically visible only from locations with a low, \ndistant horizon, and lasts just a few seconds.  A \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/software/programs/gflash.bas\">green flash</a> is also visible for a rising \n<a href=\"ap970226.html\">Sun</a>, but takes better timing to spot.  \nA slight variant of this was caught in the above photograph, \nwhere much of the \n<a href=\"ap970106.html\">Sun</a> was still visible, \nbut the very top appeared momentarily green.  The \n<a href=\"ap970108.html\">Sun</a> itself does <i> not </i> turn \npartly green, the effect is caused by layers of the \n<a href=\"http://www.waterw.com/~science/blue.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> acting like a <a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~coalitn/sciedoutreach/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/prism.html\">prism</a>.",
