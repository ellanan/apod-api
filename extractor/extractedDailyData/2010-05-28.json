  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA moonlit chapel stands in the foreground of this\nnight-scape from the historic Greek\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes\">island of Rhodes</a>.\n\nThe tantalizing sky above features a colorful\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/cormoon.htm\">lunar corona</a>,\nwhere bright moonlight is diffracted by water droplets in the thin clouds\ndrifting in front of the lunar disk.\n\nCaptured in the early\n<a href=\"ap100521.html\">evening on May 17</a>, the image is a composite\nof 9 exposures in sequence, each 20 seconds long.\n\nIt shows <a href=\"ap100311.html\">star trails</a> too, including\nthe very bright trail of planet Venus setting, below the Moon, near the right\nedge of the frame.\n\n<a href=\"ap080604.html\">Arcing from the horizon</a>\non the right to the picture's left edge is\na surprisingly colorful trail produced by space shuttle\n<a href=\"ap100508.html\">orbiter Atlantis</a>\ndocked with the\n<a href=\"ap100303.html\">International Space Station</a>.\n\nSome 350 kilometers above Earth's surface, the\n<a href=\"ap100523.html\">orbiter and station</a>\npair are still bathed in sunlight.\n\nThough it might seem more appropriate when seen in skies over Rhodes,\nthe shuttle orbiter Atlantis\nwasn't directly named for the legendary\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis\">island of Atlantis</a>.\n\nInstead, it was named for 1930s vintage sailing ship\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Atlantis\">RV Atlantis</a>,\nthe first research vessel operated by the Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institute.",
