  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would you do if you saw the Sun disappear? \n\nQuite possibly: cheer.  \n\nThat's what many exuberant sky watchers did across \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia\">Indonesia</a> during a total\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html\">eclipse of the Sun</a> last week.\n\nThere and then, the land and sky \n<a href=\"ap150315.html\">went dark</a> during the day as \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/tv/index.php?project=10&amp;program=1735&amp;type=clip\">our Sun disappeared</a> for a few minutes behind our Moon. \n\nMany people watching knew they were witnessing a rare event, and their joyous exclamations can be heard on the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlobrbSWwI\">featured video</a>.\n\nWhat a far cry this reaction is from \n<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar-eclipse-history.html\">centuries ago</a>, \nwhen more typical \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhistory/SEhistory.html\">eclipse reactions</a> derived from \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm\">fear</a> and \n<a href=\"http://ithinkmymomscrazy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gary1.jpg\">worry</a>. \n \nThe video shows first shows a Sun only \n<a href=\"ap130513.html\">partly eclipsed</a> by the Moon as totality approached. \n\nFrom <a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=35703\">many locations</a>, \nforeground clouds on our Earth either obscured the view or made the view \n<a href=\"ap030618.html\">more interesting</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11pasachoff.html\">total eclipse</a> was only visible from a \n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=20160309\">narrow swath of Earth</a> that included several Indonesian islands.\n\nAt the same time, in the opposite direction, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic.html\">EPIC camera</a> aboard \n<a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/\">NOAA</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/\">DSCOVR satellite</a> captured the \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">shadow</a> of the Moon \n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=87675&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=iotd_image\">moving across</a> the Earth.",
