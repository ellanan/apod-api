  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did the \n<a href=\"http://www.nauts.com/astro/apollo.html\">astronauts</a> \nget back from the \n<a href=\"lib/moon.html\">Moon</a>? The \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/APOLLO/LMordered.html\">Lunar Module</a> \nthat landed two astronauts on the Moon actually came apart.  The top part\ncontaining the astronauts carried additional rocket fuel which allowed it\nto blast away, leaving the bottom part on the Moon forever. The top part\nwould later meet up with the \n<a href=\"http://nauts.com/histpace/vehiclesNT/histapolloNT.html\">Command \nModule</a> and its astronaut pilot, which\nwere continually orbiting the Moon.  All would then return to Earth\ntogether. The \n<a href=\"http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS16/10075870.htm\">above \npicture</a> was taken by a robot TV camera left on the Moon\nby the crew of \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16j.html\">Apollo 16</a>.  \nThe frame above captures the top part of the\nLunar Module just at it was blasting off.",
