Strong evidence that the\nanswer is \"yes\" was provided in\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/94/24.html\">this 1994 image</a> made by the <a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> .  \nA close-up of the <a href=\"ap951121.html\">Orion Nebulae</a>,\nit reveals what seem to be disks of dust and gas surrounding\nnewly formed stars.\nThese fuzzy blobs, called\n\"<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/OrionProplyds.txt\">proplyds</a>\",\nappear to be infant <a href=\"ap960119.html\">solar systems in the\nprocess of formation</a>.\nOf the five stars in this field which spans about 0.14 light years,\nfour appear to have associated proplyds - three bright ones and one dark one\nseen in silhouette against the bright nebula.\nA more complete survey of 110 stars in the region\nfound 56 with proplyds.\nIf extra-solar planetary systems are common place,\n<a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/\"> are there extra-terrestrial \ncivilizations out there as well?</a>",
