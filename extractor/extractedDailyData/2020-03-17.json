  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening in the center of nearby spiral galaxy M77?\n\nThe face-on galaxy lies a mere 47 million \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> away toward the constellation of the Sea Monster \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus\">Cetus</a>). \n\nAt that estimated distance, this gorgeous \n<a href=\"https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Gordon/Gordon2.html\">island universe</a> is about 100 thousand light-years across. \n\nAlso known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_77\">NGC 1068</a>, \nits compact and very bright core is \nwell studied by astronomers exploring the mysteries of \n<a href=\"ap130312.html\">supermassive black holes</a> in active \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyfert_galaxy\">Seyfert galaxies</a>. \n\nM77 and its active core glows bright at \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">x-ray</a>, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet</a>, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible</a>, \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio</a> wavelengths. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/15679524440/\">featured sharp image</a> of M77 was taken by the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and is dominated by the (visible) \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomyknowhow.com/hydrogen-alpha.htm\">red light</a> \nemitted by <a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a>. \n\nThe image shows details of the spiral's \n<a href=\"ap161109.html\">winding spiral arms</a> as traced by \n<a href=\"ap130831.html\">obscuring dust clouds</a>, \nand red-tinted star forming regions close in to the galaxy's luminous core.",
