  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created the strange spiral structure on the left?  \n\nNo one is sure, although it is likely related to a star in a \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star</a> system entering the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> phase, when its outer atmosphere is ejected.\n \nThe <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/static/archives/releases/science_papers/potw1020.pdf\">huge spiral</a> spans about a third of a \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light year</a> across and, winding four or five complete turns, has a regularity that is without precedent.  \n\nGiven the expansion rate of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral\">spiral</a> gas, a new layer must appear about every 800 years, a close match to the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other.\n\nThe star system that created it is most commonly known as LL Pegasi, but also AFGL 3068.  The unusual structure itself has been cataloged as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS_23166%2B1655\">IRAS 23166+1655</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1020a/\">above image</a> was taken in near-<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared</a> light by the \n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nWhy the <a href=\" http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo//Applets/Spiral/Spiral330.html\">spiral glows</a> is itself a mystery, \nwith a leading hypothesis being illumination by light reflected from nearby stars.",
