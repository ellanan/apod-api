  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLocated some 7,000 light-years away toward the constellation\nPerseus, <a href=\"ap051011.html\">this pair</a> of open\nor galactic star clusters really\nis visible to the unaided eye and was cataloged in 130 BC\nby Greek astronomer <a href=\"http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/\nhipparchus.html\">Hipparchus</a>.\n\nNow known as\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n0869.html\">h and\nchi Persei</a> (NGC 869/884), the clusters\nthemselves are separated by a few hundred light-years and\ncontain stars much younger, and hotter than the Sun. \n\nBut what if this famous double star cluster were closer,\nsay only 700 light-years distant from our fair solar system,\n<a href=\"ap031213.html\">crowding</a> our sky with stars?\n\nAstrophotographer Jose Suro also imagines a\n<a href=\"ap040923.html\">clear, moonless,</a>\ndark night sky on a warm evening near tranquil waters.\n\nThe foreground is illuminated by starlight in\n<a href=\"http://jsuro.smugmug.com/gallery/1166044/1/53187221/\nMedium\">his composited</a>\ndreamlike image of the cluster pair.\n\nHe notes that while the solar system is not in the\nvicinity of such rich clusters of stars,\n<a href=\"http://www.darksky.org/index\">dark night skies</a>\nand warm evenings\n<a href=\"http://www.baltastro.org/AstroPoetry.html#NewestListed\">can\nstill</a> be inspiring\n<a href=\"http://www.darksky.org/resources/arpomuns\">on planet Earth</a>.",
