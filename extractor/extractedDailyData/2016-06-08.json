  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhile drifting through the cosmos, \na magnificent interstellar dust cloud became sculpted by \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">stellar winds</a> and radiation to assume a \nrecognizable shape. \n\nFittingly named the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula\">Horsehead Nebula</a>, it is embedded in the vast and complex Orion Nebula (M42). \n\nA potentially rewarding but difficult object to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UovzI_c5Uz4\">view personally</a> \nwith a small telescope, the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/12/image/a/\">above gorgeously detailed image</a> was \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVjrPp38YE#!\">taken</a> in 2013 in \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a> by the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nin honor of the 23rd anniversary of \n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble</a>'s launch.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap120129.html\">dark molecular cloud</a>, roughly 1,500 \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light years</a> distant, is cataloged as Barnard 33 and is seen above primarily because it is backlit by the nearby massive star \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Orionis\">Sigma Orionis</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap031007.html\">Horsehead Nebula</a> will slowly shift its \napparent shape over the next few million years and will eventually be destroyed by the \nhigh energy starlight.",
