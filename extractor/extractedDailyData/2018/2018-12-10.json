  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYour arm on Mars has unusual powers. \n\nFor one thing \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight101.com/insight/insight-instruments/\">it</a> is nearly 2 meters long, has a scoop and grapple built into \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/140817/insights-robot-arm-is-ready-to-go-to-work/\">its</a> hand, and has a camera built into \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ESASP.718E..14F\">its</a> forearm.  \n\nFor another, it will soon deploy your ear -- a \n<a href=\"https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/public-2/seis-instrument/sp-seismometer\">sensitive seismometer</a> that will listen for distant rumblings -- \nonto the surface of Mars. \n\nYour \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>momet-ear is the orange box in the foreground, \nwhile the gray dome behind it will be its protective cover. \n\nYour arm is attached to the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/about-the-lander/\">InSight robotic lander</a> that touched down on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> two weeks ago.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, your ear has \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7300\">already heard something</a> -- \nslight vibrations caused by the \n<a href=\"ap150303.html\">Martian wind</a> flowing over the solar panels. \n\nLight from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a> is being collected by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/solarcells\">solar panels</a>, part of one being visible on the far right.\n\nActually, at the present time, you have \n<a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sxuayziz716y.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=097b903cf1661ce23891d7153406f37ab413f46b\">two arms</a> operating on Mars, but they are separated by about 600 kilometers.\n\nThat's because your \n<a href=\"ap120827.html\">other active arm</a> is connected to the \n<a href=\"ap180623.html\">Curiosity rover</a> exploring a distant crater. \n\nTaken a week ago, \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/2004/040503/full/news040503-6.html\">rusty soil</a> and rocks are visible in the \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22871\">featured image</a> beyond Insight, as well as the \n<a href=\"http://serious-science.org/what-color-is-the-sky-on-mars-7310\">orange sky of Mars</a>.",
