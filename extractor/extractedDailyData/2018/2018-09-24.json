  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTwo small robots have begun hopping around the surface of asteroid Ryugu.\n\nThe rovers, each the size of a small \n<a href=\"ap130401.html\">frying pan</a>, \nmove around the low gravity of kilometer-sized \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162173_Ryugu\">162173 Ryugu</a> by hopping, \nstaying aloft for about 15 minutes and \ntypically landing again several meters away. \n\nOn Saturday, Rover 1A returned an \n<a href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20180922e/\">early picture</a> of its \n<a href=\"ap180822.html\">new home world</a>, on the left, \nduring one of its first hops.\n\nOn Friday, lander \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/minerva-ii1-successful-landing.html\">MINERVA-II-1</a> detached from its mothership \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa2\">Hayabusa2</a>, \ndropped Rovers 1A and 1B, and \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkvEgvzAw0o\">then landed</a> on Ryugu.\n\n<a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/article/2014/interview/vol88/\">Studying Ryugu</a> could \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa\">tell humanity</a> \nnot only about Ryugu's surface and interior, \nbut about what materials were available in the early \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> for the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\">development of life</a>. \n\nTwo more hopping rovers are \n<a href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/topics/mission_schedule_e/\">planned</a> for release, and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/services/missions/universe/Hayabusa2.html\">Hayabusa2</a><a> itself is scheduled to collect a surface sample from \n</a><a href=\"ap180625.html\">Ryugu</a> and return it to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> for detailed analysis before 2021.",
