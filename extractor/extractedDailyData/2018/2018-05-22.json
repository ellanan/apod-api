  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does the right part of this image of the Moon stand out? \n\nShadows.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)\">terminator</a> line -- the line between light and dark -- occurs in the featured image so that just over half \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a>'s face is illuminated by sunlight.\n\nThe lunar surface appears different nearer \n<a href=\"ap150427.html\">the terminator</a> because there \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> is nearer the horizon and therefore causes \n<a href=\"ap180320.html\">shadows to become increasingly long</a>. \n\nThese shadows make it easier for us to discern \n<a href=\"ap161210.html\">structure</a>, giving us \n<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/11/19/cool-visual-illusions-the-powe/\">depth cues</a> so that the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space\">two-dimensional</a> image, when dominated by shadows, appears almost \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space\">three-dimensional</a>.\n\nTherefore, as the \n<a href=\"ap120205.html\">Moon fades</a> from light to dark, \n<a href=\"ap170717.html\">shadows</a> not only tell us the high from the low, \nbut become noticeable for increasingly shorter structures.\n\nFor example, many craters appear near the terminator because their height makes them easier to discern there. \n\nThe image was taken two weeks ago when the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ZHdzl6ZWg\">lunar phase</a> was \n<a href=\"https://bobmoler.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/waxing-waning-moon_nasa-bill-dunford.png\">waning gibbous</a>.\n\nThe next \n<a href=\"ap180328.html\">full moon</a>, a Moon without shadows, \nwill occur one week from today.",
