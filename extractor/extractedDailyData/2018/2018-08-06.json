  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCosmic rays from outer space go through your body every second. \n\nTypically, they do you no harm.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://nusoft.fnal.gov/nova/public/\">featured image</a> shows some of these fast moving particles as streaks going through Fermilab's \n<a href=\"http://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/how-does-nova-work/\">NOvA Far Detector</a> located in Ash River, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota\">Minnesota</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>. \n\nAlthough the image updates every 15 seconds, it only shows \n<a href=\"http://astro.fnal.gov/what-are-these-cosmic-rays/\">cosmic rays</a> that occurred over a (changing) small fraction of that time, and mostly shows only one type of particle: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon\">muon</a>s.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/\">NOvA</a> \nFar Detector's main purpose is not to detect cosmic rays, though, but rather \n<a href=\"http://neutrinophysics.fnal.gov/\">neutrinos</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://www-numi.fnal.gov/\">NuMI</a> \nbeam shot through the Earth from \n<a href=\"http://www.fnal.gov/\">Fermilab</a> near \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMJ7KwqiO8c\">Chicago</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois\">Illinois</a>, USA, \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2rFVgvc41E\">810 kilometers away</a>. \n\nOnly a few \n<a href=\"ap980605.html\">neutrino</a> events are expected in NOvA per week, though.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuMI\">NuMI</a> / \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOvA\">NOvA</a> experiment is allowing humanity to better explore the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe4veClYxkE\">nature of neutrinos</a>, \nfor example how frequently they change type during their trip. \n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/mystery-of-high-energy-cosmic-rays-news\">Cosmic rays</a> themselves were \n<a href=\"https://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/hist_1900.html\">discovered</a> \nonly about 100 years ago and can not only \n<a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/17/02/19/2330251/serious-computer-glitches-can-be-caused-by-cosmic-rays\">alter computer memory</a>, \nbut may have helped to create \n<a href=\"ap120821.html\">DNA</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/accidents-human-evolution/\">mutations</a> that resulted in, eventually, \n<a href=\"ap160815.html\">humans</a>.",
