  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nFrom our vantage point in the\n<a href=\"ap080606.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, we see\nNGC 3344 face-on.\n\nNearly 40,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/spir.html\">spiral galaxy</a>\nis located just 20 million light-years away in the\nconstellation of Leo Minor.\n\nThis multi-color Hubble Space Telescope\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1803a/\">close-up\nof NGC 3344</a> includes remarkable details from near infrared to\nultraviolet wavelengths.\n\nThe frame extends some 15,000 light-years across the\nspiral's central regions.\n\nFrom the core outward,\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1803a/\">the galaxy's\ncolors change</a> from the yellowish\nlight of old stars in the center to young blue star\nclusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented\nspiral arms.\n\nOf course, the bright stars with a spiky appearance\nare in front of NGC 3344 and lie well within our own Milky Way.",
