  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe comet PanSTARRS also known as\n<a href=\"ap180118.html\">the blue comet</a> (C/2016 R2)\nreally is near the lower left edge of this stunning, wide field view\nrecorded on January 13.\n\nSpanning nearly 20 degrees on the sky,\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/141707873@N03/38795439545/\">the\ncosmic landscape</a> is explored by well-exposed and processed frames\nfrom a sensitive digital camera.  \n\nIt consists of colorful clouds and dusty dark nebulae otherwise\n<a href=\"ap090411.html\">too faint</a> for your eye to see, though.\n\nAt top right, the\n<a href=\"ap160112.html\">California</a> Nebula (aka NGC 1499) does have a\nfamiliar shape.\n\nIts coastline is over 60 light-years long and lies\nsome 1,500 light-years away.\n\nThe nebula's pronounced reddish glow is from hydrogen atoms ionized\nby luminous blue star Xi Persei just below it.\n\nNear bottom center, the famous\n<a href=\"ap150617.html\">Pleiades</a> star cluster is some 400\nlight-years distant and around 15 light-years\nacross.\n\nIts spectacular blue color is due to the reflection of starlight\nby interstellar dust.\n\nIn between are hot stars of the Perseus OB2\nassociation and dusty,\n<a href=\"ap160314.html\">dark nebulae</a> along the edge of the nearby,\nmassive Taurus and Perseus molecular clouds. \n\nEmission from unusually abundant ionized carbon monoxide (CO+)\nmolecules fluorescing in sunlight\nis largely responsible for the telltale blue tint of the\n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/index.php?title=2016%20r2\">remarkable\ncomet's tail</a>.\n\nThe comet was about 17 light minutes\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/comets\">from Earth</a>.",
