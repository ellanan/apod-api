  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is this neutron star off-center?\n\nRecently a lone neutron star \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01006\">has been found within the debris</a> \nleft over from an old \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic0515a/\">supernova explosion</a>.\n\nThe \"lonely neutron star\" in question is the \nblue dot at the center of the red nebula near the bottom left of \n<a href=\"ap090905.html\">E0102-72.3</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2018/e0102/\">featured image composite</a>, blue represents X-ray light captured by NASA's \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/\">Chandra Observatory</a>, \nwhile red and green represent optical light captured by \n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/\">ESO</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap000707.html\">Very Large Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a> and NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in orbit. \n\nThe displaced position of this \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star\">neutron star</a> \nis unexpected since the dense star is thought to be the \ncore of the star that exploded in the supernova and created the \n<a href=\"ap000414.html\">outer nebula</a>. \n\nIt could be that the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzF1zQ-4vwo\">neutron star in E0102</a> was pushed away from the nebula's center by the supernova itself, but then it seems odd that the smaller red ring remains centered on the \n<a href=\"ap170501.html\">neutron star</a>. \n\nAlternatively, the \n<a href=\"ap991209.html\">outer nebula</a> \ncould have been expelled during a different scenario -- \nperhaps even involving \n<a href=\"ap991219.html\">another star</a>.  \n\nFuture observations of \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2018/e0102/e0102_BU.mp4\">the nebulas and neutron star</a> appear likely to resolve the situation.",
