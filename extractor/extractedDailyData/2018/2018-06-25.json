  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt looks like a big space diamond -- but with craters.\n\nIt's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162173_Ryugu\">162173 Ryugu</a> \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%ABg%C5%AB-j%C5%8D\">Dragon's Castle</a>), and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>'s robotic \n<a href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/\">Hayabusa2 mission</a> \nis now arriving at this \n<a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/\">near-Earth</a> asteroid.\n\nAmbitious \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa2\">Hayabusa2</a> is carrying an armada of separable probes, including two impactors, \nfour small close-proximity hoverers, \nthree small surface hoppers, and the \n<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10975/\">Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout</a> (MASCOT) which will \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H4aZX_8hMA\">land, study, and move around</a> on Ryugu's surface.\n\nMost of these are equipped with cameras.   \n\nMoreover, \n<a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/hayabusa2/faq.html\">Hayabusa2</a> itself is \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2018/0525-keep-up-with-hayabusa2.html\">scheduled</a> to collect surface samples and return these samples to Earth for a \n<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10976/1756_read-23829/#/gallery/11288\">detailed analysis</a> near the end of 2020. \n\nPreviously, what was known about asteroid Ryugu was its orbit, that it spans about one kilometer, and that it has a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-type_asteroid\">dark surface</a> \nthat reflects unusual colors. \n\n<a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/article/2014/interview/vol88/\">Studying Ryugu</a> could \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa\">tell humanity</a> \nnot only about Ryugu's surface and interior, \nbut about what materials were available in the early \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> for the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\">development of life</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/topics/20180621je/index_e.html\">Pictured</a>, a series of approach images shows features suggestive of large \n<a href=\"ap180507.html\">boulder</a>s and \n<a href=\"ap140209.html\">craters</a>.",
