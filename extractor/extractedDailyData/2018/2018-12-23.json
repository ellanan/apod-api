  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAbout 12 seconds into this video, something unusual happens.\n\nThe Earth begins to rise. \n\nNever seen by humans before, the \n<a href=\"ap150906.html\">rise of the Earth</a> \nover the limb of the Moon occurred \n50 years ago tomorrow and surprised and amazed the crew of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo-8.html\">Apollo 8</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/earthrise.html\">crew immediately scrambled</a> to take still images of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/297755main_gpn-2001-000009_full_0_0.jpg\">stunning vista</a> caused by \n<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/moon-apollo-8-insider-stories/\">Apollo 8</a>'s orbit around the Moon.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4593\">featured video</a> is a modern reconstruction of \n<a href=\"https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/launches-and-events/events-calendar/2018/december/event-earthrise-50th-anniversary-celebration\">the event</a> as it would have looked were it recorded with a modern movie camera.\n\nThe colorful orb of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">our Earth</a> stood out as a familiar \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4129\">icon rising</a> above a distant and \n<a href=\"ap031109.html\">unfamiliar moonscape</a>, \nthe whole scene the conceptual reverse of a \n<a href=\"ap170616.html\">more familiar moonrise</a> as seen from Earth.\n\nTo many, the scene also spoke about the unity of humanity: that big \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble\">blue marble</a> -- \nthat's us -- we all live there.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1R5QqhPq1Ik\">two-minute video</a> is not time-lapse -- \nthis is the real speed of the Earth rising through the windows of \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/science/earthrise-moon-apollo-nasa.html\">Apollo 8</a>.\n\nSeven months and three missions later, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html\">Apollo 11</a> astronauts would not only circle Earth's moon, but \n<a href=\"ap981004.html\">land on it</a>.",
