  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere is something unusual about this astronomically-oriented photograph.\n\nIt's not obvious -- it was discovered only during post-processing.\n\nIt is not \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a>, although capturing the Moon rising during a total lunar eclipse is quite an unusually interesting sight. \n\n(Other interesting images also captured during last month's eclipse can be found \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/APOD.Sky/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1520357464735134\">here</a>.)  \n\nIt is not \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a>, found to the lower right of the Moon, \nalthough Mars being captured near its brightest \nalso makes for an unusually interesting sight. \n\n(Mars is visible nearly the entire night this month; other interesting images of it can be found \n<a href=\"ap180601.html\">h</a><a href=\"ap180709.html\">e</a><a href=\"ap180730.html\">r</a><a href=\"ap160529.html\">e</a>.) \n\nIt is not the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiguilles_Rouges\">foreground mountains</a>, although the French \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a> \ndo provide unusually spectacular perspectives on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">planet Earth</a>.\n\n(Other interesting mountainous starscapes can be found \n<a href=\"ap170818.html\">h</a><a href=\"ap161021.html\">e</a><a href=\"ap160225.html\">r</a><a href=\"ap160111.html\">e</a>.) \n\nIt is the goat.",
