  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those red clouds surrounding the Andromeda galaxy?\n\nThis galaxy, M31, is often imaged by planet Earth-based astronomers.\n\nAs the nearest large spiral galaxy, it is a familiar sight\nwith dark dust lanes, bright yellowish core, and\n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/phat/\">spiral arms traced</a> \nby clouds of bright blue stars. \n\nA mosaic of well-exposed broad and narrow-band image data, \nthis colorful portrait of our\nneighboring <a href=\"ap051222.html\">island universe</a>\noffers strikingly unfamiliar\nfeatures though, faint reddish clouds of glowing\nionized hydrogen gas in the same wide field of view.\n\nThese <a href=\"ap051223.html\">ionized hydrogen</a> clouds surely\nlie in the foreground of the scene, well within our \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/charting-the-milky-way-from-the-inside-out\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nThey are likely associated with the pervasive, dusty\n<a href=\"ap151012.html\">interstellar cirrus</a>\nclouds scattered hundreds of light-years above our own galactic plane.",
