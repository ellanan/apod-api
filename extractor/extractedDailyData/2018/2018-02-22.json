  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nNot all roses are red\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roses_Are_Red\">of course</a>,\nbut they can still be very pretty.\n\nLikewise, the beautiful\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/nebulae/ngc2237.html\">Rosette\nNebula</a> and other star forming regions are often shown in\nastronomical images with a predominately red hue,\nin part because the dominant emission in the nebula is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">from hydrogen atoms</a>.\n\nHydrogen's strongest optical emission line, known as H-alpha,\nis in the red region of the spectrum, but the beauty of an\nemission nebula need not be appreciated\nin red light alone.\n\n<a href=\"http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~koppen/discharge/index.html\">Other\natoms</a> in the nebula are also excited by energetic\nstarlight and produce narrow emission lines as well.\n\nIn this gorgeous view of the Rosette Nebula,\nnarrowband images are combined to show\nemission from sulfur atoms in red, hydrogen in blue, and\noxygen in green.\n\nIn fact, the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/behind_the_pictures/\nmeaning_of_color/eagle.shtml\">scheme of mapping</a> these narrow atomic\nemission lines into broader colors is adopted in\nmany <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/\">Hubble images</a>\nof stellar nurseries.\n\nThe image spans about 100 light-years in\nthe constellation Monoceros, at the 3,000 light-year\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/5000lys.html\">estimated</a>\ndistance of the\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2244.html\">Rosette\nNebula</a>.\n\nTo make the Rosette red, just follow\n<a href=\"image/1802/RosetteHRGBColesHelm1024.jpg\">this link</a> or\nslide your cursor over the image.",
