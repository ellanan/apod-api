  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nAbout 70,000 light-years across,\n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1107/\">NGC 247\nis a spiral galaxy</a> smaller than our Milky Way.\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2699\">Measured to be</a>\nonly 11 million light-years distant it is nearby though.\n\nTilted nearly edge-on as seen\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/stars-galaxies/\">from our perspective</a>,\nit dominates this telescopic field of view toward the\nsouthern constellation Cetus.\n\nThe pronounced void on one side of the galaxy's disk recalls\nfor some its popular name, the Needle's Eye galaxy.\n\nMany background galaxies are visible in\n<a href=\"http://www.chart32.de/index.php/component/k2/item/290\">this sharp\ngalaxy portrait</a>, including the remarkable string of four galaxies\njust below and left of NGC 247 known\nas Burbidge's Chain.\n\nBurbidge's Chain galaxies are about 300 million light-years distant.\n\nThe deep image even reveals that the two leftmost galaxies in the chain are\napparently interacting, joined by a faint bridge of material.\n\nNGC 247 itself is part of the Sculptor Group of galaxies along with the\n<a href=\"ap180322.html\">shiny spiral NGC 253</a>.",
