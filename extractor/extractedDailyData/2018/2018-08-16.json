  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe brief flash of a bright Perseid meteor streaks across the\nupper right in this composited series of exposures\nmade early Sunday morning near the peak of the annual\nPerseid meteor shower.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/seminoleplanet/photos/\na.264983157311.151633.143359672311/10155445940222312/?type=3&amp;theater\">Set\nup about two miles</a> from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape\nCanaveral Air Force Station, the photographer also captured the\nfour minute long trail of a Delta IV Heavy rocket carrying the\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/\nnasa-ula-launch-parker-solar-probe-on-historic-journey-to-touch-sun\">Parker\nSolar Probe</a> into the dark morning sky.\n\nPerseid meteors aren't slow.\n\n<a href=\"ap180808.html\">The grains of dust</a>\nfrom periodic comet Swift-Tuttle vaporize as they\nplow through Earth's upper atmosphere at about\n60 kilometers per <i>second</i> (133,000 mph).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/\nparker-solar-probe-preview.html\">On its way</a>\nto seven gravity-assist flybys of Venus\nover its seven year mission, the Parker Solar Probe's closest\napproach to the Sun will steadily decrease,\nfinally reaching a distance of 6.1 million kilometers \n(3.8 million miles).\n\nThat's about 1/8 the distance between Mercury and the Sun,\nand within the <a href=\"ap170823.html\">solar corona</a>,\nthe Sun's tenuous outer atmosphere.\n\nBy then it will be traveling roughly 190 kilometers per <i>second</i>\n(430,000 mph) with respect to the Sun, a record for fastest spacecraft\nfrom planet Earth.",
