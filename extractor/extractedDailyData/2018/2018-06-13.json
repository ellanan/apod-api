  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat kind of rainbow is this?\n\nIn this case, no rain was involved -- what is pictured is actually a red \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz285.htm\">cloudbow</a>.\n\nThe unusual sky arc was spotted last month during sunset in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxUc8IkT8OQ\">Rehoboth Beach</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware\">Delaware</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.\n\nWhen the photographer realized that what he was seeing was extraordinary, he captured it with the only camera available -- a cell phone. \n\n<a href=\"https://pmm.nasa.gov/education/content/what-are-clouds-made-are-they-more-likely-form-polluted-air-or-pristine-air\">Clouds are made of</a> water droplets, and in a cloudbow a \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogdrpsz.htm\">cloud-droplet group</a> reflects back light from the bright Sun (or Moon) on the opposite side of the sky. \n\nSimilar phenomena include \n<a href=\"ap100504.html\">fogbows</a> and \n<a href=\"ap161222.html\">airplane glories</a>.\n\nHere, the <a href=\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131027-sunset-sky-change-color-red-clouds-science/\">red color</a> was caused by atmospheric air preferentially scattering away blue light -- which simultaneously makes most of the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/\">sky appear blue</a>.\n\nA careful inspection reveals a \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supform.htm\">supernumery bow</a> just inside the outermost arc, a bow caused by \n<a href=\"https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/microscope-resource/primer/lightandcolor/diffraction/\">quantum</a>  \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/corform.htm\">diffraction</a>.",
