  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first on\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/xtra/history/m-cat71.html\">Charles\nMessier's</a> famous list of things which are\n<a href=\"ap110901.html\">not comets</a>.\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"ap010602.html\">the Crab is</a>\nnow known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding\ncloud of debris from the explosion of a massive star.\n\nThe violent birth of the Crab was\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/more/m001_sn.html\">witnessed\nby astronomers</a> in the year 1054.\n\nRoughly 10 light-years across today, the nebula is still expanding\nat a rate of over 1,000 kilometers per second.\n\nOver the past decade, its expansion has been documented in\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/327338/0/\">this stunning\ntime-lapse movie</a>.\n\nIn each year from 2008 to 2017, an image was produced with the same\ntelescope and camera from a remote observatory in Austria.\n\nCombined in the time-lapse movie, the 10 images represent 32 hours of total\nintegration time.\n\nThe sharp, processed frames even reveal the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/video/899/news/104-annotated\">dynamic\nenergetic emission</a> within the incredible expanding Crab.\n\nThe Crab Nebula lies about 6,500 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"ap121224.html\">constellation Taurus</a>.",
