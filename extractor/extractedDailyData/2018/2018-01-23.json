  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy do some spiral galaxies have a ring around the center?\n\nSpiral galaxy \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1398\">NGC 1398</a> not only has a \n<a href=\"ap170710.html\">ring</a> of pearly stars, gas and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> around its center, but a \n<a href=\"ap160109.html\">bar</a> of stars and gas <i> across </i> its center, \nand spiral arms that appear like ribbons farther out. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1801a/\">featured image</a> was taken with \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/\">ESO</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/usa/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/\">Very Large Telescope</a> at the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_LwlwJWZN0\">Paranal Observatory</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a> \nand resolves this \n<a href=\"ap171226.html\">grand spiral</a> in impressive detail.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...447..159M\">NGC 1398</a> lies about 65 million \n<a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm\">light years</a> distant, meaning the light we see today left this galaxy when \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event\">dinosaurs were disappearing</a> from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth\">Earth</a>. \n\nThe photogenic galaxy is visible with \na small telescope toward the constellation of the Furnace \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax\">Fornax</a>).\n\nThe <a href=\"ap170807.html\">ring near the center</a> is likely an expanding \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory\">density wave</a> of star formation, caused either by a \n<a href=\"ap130514.html\">gravitational encounter with another galaxy</a>, \nor by the galaxy's own gravitational asymmetries.",
