  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere did that spot come from? \n\nAmateur astronomer Victor Buso was testing out a new camera on his telescope in 2016 when he noticed a curious spot of light appear -- and remain.\n\nAfter reporting \n<a href=\"http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/02/21/amateur-astronomer-captures-rare-first-light-from-massive-exploding-star/\">this unusual observation</a>, \nthis spot was determined to be light from a \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/\">supernova</a> \njust as it was becoming visible -- in an earlier stage \nthan had ever been photographed optically before.\n\nThe discovery before and after images, taken about an hour apart, \nare shown in the inset of a \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1539a/\">more detailed image</a> \nof the same spiral galaxy, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_613\">NGC 613</a>, \ntaken by the <a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nFollow-up observations show that \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04587\">SN 2016gkg</a> was likely the explosion of a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergiant_star\">supergiant star</a>, \nand Buso likely captured the stage where the outgoing \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgv6IJnRrlI\">detonation wave</a> \nfrom the stellar core \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKMxyMnVaew\">broke through</a> \nthe star's surface. \n\nSince <a href=\"http://sainthelenaisland.info/astronomysirius.jpg\">astronomers</a> have spent years \n<a href=\"http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/bait/kait.html\">monitoring galaxies for supernovas</a> without seeing such a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25151\">\"break out\" event</a>, \nthe odds of Buso capturing this \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/science/supernova-photo-camera.html\">have been compared</a> to \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ldevreeede/2856559399/sizes/o/\">winning a lottery</a>.",
