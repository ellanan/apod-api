  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWelcome to Mars, NASA Insight. \n\nYesterday NASA's robotic spacecraft \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/overview/\">InSight</a> \nmade a dramatic landing on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> after a \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/21905/insights-route-to-mars/\">six-month trek</a> across the inner Solar System.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7290\">Needing to brake</a> from 20,000 km per hour to zero in about \n<a href=\"ap120731.html\">seven minutes</a>, Insight decelerated by as much as 8 \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force\"> g's</a> \nand heated up to 1500 degrees \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius\">Celsius</a> \nas it deployed a heat shield, \na parachute, and at the end, rockets. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22829\">featured image</a> \nwas the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22159/insights-first-image-from-mars/?site=insight\">first taken</a> by InSight on Mars, and welcome proof that the spacecraft had shed enough speed to \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/kyD0q57zw40\">land softly</a> \nand function on the red planet.\n\nDuring its final descent, InSight's rockets \n<a href=\"ap180623.html\">kicked up dust</a> \nwhich can be seen stuck to the lens cap of the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/about-the-lander/#cameras\">Instrument Context Camera</a>.\n\nPast the spotty dirt, parts of \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/about-the-lander/\">the lander</a> that are visible include \ncover bolts at the bottom and a lander footpad on the lower right.\n\nSmall rocks are \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22159/insights-first-image-from-mars/?site=insight\">visible across</a> the rusty red soil, \nwhile the arc across the top of the image is the \n<a href=\"ap150512.html\">Martian horizon</a> dividing land and sky.\n\nOver the next few weeks\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/\">InSight</a> will deploy several scientific instruments, including a \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/seis/\">rumble-detecting seismometer</a>. \n\nThese instruments are expected to give humanity unprecedented data involving the \n<a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/308/5725/1120\">interior of Mars</a>, a region thought to harbor \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JGR...10517563S\">formation clues</a> not only about Mars, but \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>.",
