  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis composite of images spaced some 5 to 9 days apart,\nfrom late April (bottom right) through November 5 (top left),\ntraces the retrograde motion of\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/\nopposition\">ruddy-colored Mars</a> through\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/Mars\">planet Earth's night sky</a>.\n\nTo connect the dots and dates in this 2018 Mars retrograde loop,\njust slide your cursor over the picture\n(and check out <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/298439756\">this animation</a>).\n\nBut Mars didn't actually reverse the direction of its orbit.\n\nInstead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background\nstars is a reflection of the motion of the Earth itself.\n\nRetrograde motion\n<a href=\"http://projects.astro.illinois.edu/data/Retrograde/\">can be\nseen</a> each time Earth overtakes\nand laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the\nEarth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit. \n\nOn July 27, Mars was near its favorable 2018 perihelic opposition,\nwhen Mars was closest to the Sun in its orbit\nwhile also\n<a href=\"ap180727.html\">opposite the Sun</a> in Earth's sky.\n\nFor that date, the frame used in this composite was taken during the\n<a href=\"ap180802.html\">total lunar eclipse</a>.",
