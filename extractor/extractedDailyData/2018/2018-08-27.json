  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere were you during the Great American Eclipse of 2017? \n\nA year ago last week, over 100 million of people in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America\">North America</a> went outside to see a \n<a href=\"ap180211.html\">partial eclipse</a> of the Sun, \nwhile over ten million drove across part of the \nUSA to see the Sun completely disappear behind the Moon -- a \n<a href=\"ap170906.html\">total solar eclipse</a>.\n\nAn <a href=\"https://www.isr.umich.edu/cps/initialeclipseviewingreport.pdf\">estimated 88 percent</a> of American adults saw the eclipse either personally or electronically.\n\nOne of the \n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/08/14/solar-eclipse-was-one-most-watched-events-american-history-survey-finds/\">better photographed events</a> \nin human history, \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/science/pictures-total-eclipse.html\">images from the eclipse</a> \nincluded \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/AstronomyPictureOfTheDay/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1396657207036403\">some unusual vistas</a>, \nsuch as from balloons floating in the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's stratosphere</a>.\n\nAbout fifty such robotic balloons were launched as part of NASA's \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.montana.edu/\">Eclipse Ballooning project</a>.\n\nFeatured is a frame taken from a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPgPIIg3CUs\">360-degree panoramic video</a> captured by one such balloon set aloft in Idaho by \n<a href=\"https://www.upi.com/NASA-students-to-study-eclipse-with-high-altitude-balloons/4211502811845/\">students</a> from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil\">Brazil</a> in conjunction with \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.montana.edu/\">Montana State University</a>.\n\nPictured, the dark \n<a href=\"ap170717.html\">shadow of the Moon</a> was \n<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8396703/\">seen crossing</a> the Earth below. \n\nAlthough the total \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eclipsesHOW.png\">eclipse</a> lasted less than three minutes, many \n<a href=\"ap170908.html\">who saw it</a> may  \n<a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/solar-system/experiencing-totality-eclipse-stories-from-sky-telescope/\">remember it for a lifetime</a>.\n\nMany North Americans will get a another chance to \n<a href=\"ap170912.html\">experience a total solar eclipse</a> in \n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/what%E2%80%99s-what%E2%80%99s-next\">2024</a>.",
