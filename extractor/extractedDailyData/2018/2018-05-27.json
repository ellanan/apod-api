  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes it rain on the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a>?\n\nYes, although what falls is not water but extremely hot \n<a href=\"https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wplasma.html\">plasma</a>.\n\nAn <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/news/coronal-rain.html\">example occurred</a> \nin mid-July 2012 after an eruption on the Sun that produced both a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection\">Coronal Mass Ejection</a> \nand a moderate <a href=\"ap031029.html\">solar flare</a>. \n\nWhat was more unusual, however, was what happened next.\n\nPlasma in the nearby \n<a href=\"ap180430.html\">solar corona</a> \nwas imaged cooling and falling back, a phenomenon known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_Rain\">coronal rain</a>.\n\nBecause they are electrically charged, \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whelect.html\">electrons</a>, \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/proton.html\">protons</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion\">ions</a> in the rain were \ngracefully channeled along existing \n<a href=\"ap050814.html\">magnetic loops</a> near the Sun's surface, \nmaking the scene appear as a surreal three-dimensional sourceless waterfall.\n\nThe resulting \n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/21/coronal_rain_streams_of_ionized_gas_rain_on_sun_after_a_solar_flare.html\">surprisingly-serene spectacle</a> is shown in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> \nand highlights matter glowing at a temperature of about 50,000 \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin\">Kelvin</a>.\n\nEach second in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ghaf2du-XM\">featured time lapse video</a> \ntakes about 6 minutes in real time, so that the entire \n<a href=\"http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004000/a004026/\">coronal rain sequence</a> lasted about 10 hours.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plasma-rain-sun-atmosphere-falls-surprising-places\">Recent observations</a> have confirmed that that coronal rain can also occur in smaller loops for as long as 30 hours.",
