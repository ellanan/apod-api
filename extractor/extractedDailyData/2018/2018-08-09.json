  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMars is also known as\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/#red_planet/0\">The Red Planet</a>,\noften seen with a reddish tinge in dark night skies.\n\nMars shines brightly at the upper left of this\ngorgeous morning twilight view from Mornington Peninsula,\nVictoria, Australia, but the Moon and planet Earth look redder still.\n\nTaken on July 27, the totally eclipsed Moon is setting.\n\nIt looks reddened because the\n<a href=\"ap180203.html\">Earth's umbral shadow</a> isn't completely dark.\n\nInstead Earth's shadow is suffused with a faint red light from all the\nplanet's sunsets and sunrises seen from the\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4341\">perspective of an eclipsed\nMoon.</a>\n\nThe sunsets and sunrises are reddened because Earth's\natmosphere scatters blue light more strongly than red, creating\nthe faint bluish twilight sky.\n\nOf course, <a href=\"ap180802.html\">craggy seaside</a> rocks also\ntake on the reddened colors of this Australian sunrise.",
