  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nToday Comet Wirtanen passes by the Earth.\n\nThe kilometer-sized dirty snowball orbits the Sun every 5.4 years, \nranging as far out as \n<a href=\"ap181214.html\">Jupiter</a> and as close in as the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a>.\n\nToday \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46P/Wirtanen\">Comet 46P/Wirtanen</a> passes within only \n31 lunar distances to the Earth, the closest approach in 70 years. \n\nIf you know \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/46p-info\">where to look</a> (Taurus), \nyou can see \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/comets/46p-wirtanen-2018.html\">the comet</a> through binoculars as an unusual \n<a href=\"ap181115.html\">blue smudge</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rmsphotography95/photos/a.386953088074201/1535643489871816/?type=3&amp;theater\">Pictured</a> a week ago, \nComet Wirtanen was photographed in the sky beyond an old abandoned church in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagen\">Skagen</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark\">Denmark</a>.\n \nThe image composite also captures the astrophotographer. \n\nAfter \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\">today</a>, the comet will begin to fade as \n<a href=\"ap181215.html\">it</a> recedes from the Earth and the Sun.",
