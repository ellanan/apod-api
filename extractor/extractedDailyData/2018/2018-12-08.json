  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nYou can pack a lot of sky watching into 30 seconds on this tiny planet.\n\nOf course, the full spherical image timelapse video\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QizgzcZzu_8\">was recorded</a> on\n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\">planet Earth</a>, from\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1llWnhX1-c\">Grande\nPines Observatory</a> outside Pinehurst, North Carolina.\n\nIt was shot in early September with a single camera and circular\nfisheye lens,\ndigitally combining one 24-hour period with camera and lens pointed up\nwith one taken with camera and lens pointed down.\n\nThe resulting image data is processed and projected onto\na flat frame centered on the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nNadir#/media/File:Zenith-Nadir-Horizon.svg\">nadir</a>,\nthe point directly below the camera.\n\nWatch as clouds pass, shadows creep, and the sky cycles from day to night\nwhen stars swirl around the horizon.\n\nKeep watching, though.\n\nIn a second sequence the projected center is the\n<a href=\"ap120802.html\">south celestial pole</a>,\nplanet Earth's axis of rotation below the tiny planet horizon.\n\nHolding the stars fixed, the horizon itself rotates as the tiny\nplanet swings around the frame, hiding half the sky\nthrough day <a href=\"ap151016.html\">and night</a>.",
