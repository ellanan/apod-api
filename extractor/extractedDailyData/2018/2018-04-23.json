  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Blue Horsehead Nebula looks quite different in infrared light. \n\nIn <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible light</a>, the reflecting \n<a href=\"http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/space-environment/2-what-is-interstellar-dust.html\">dust</a> of the nebula \n<a href=\"ap090521.html\">appears blue and shaped like a horse's head</a>.\n\nIn <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared light</a>, however, a complex labyrinth of filaments, caverns, and cocoons of glowing dust and gas emerges, making it hard to even \n<a href=\"ap140727.html\">identify the equine icon</a>.  \n\nThe featured image of the nebula was created in three infrared colors (R=22, G=12, B=4.6 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre\">micron</a>s) \nfrom data taken by NASA's orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/wise/overview.cfm\">Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE) spacecraft.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/IC4592-WISE-mouseover.html\">The nebula</a> is cataloged as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_4592\">IC 4592</a> \nand spans about 40 light years, lying about 400 light years away toward the constellation\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius\">Scorpius</a>\nalong the plane of our \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way</a> Galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/gallery_ic4592.html\">IC 4592</a> \nis fainter but covers an angularly greater region than the better known \n<a href=\"ap171227.html\">Horsehead Nebula</a> of \n<a href=\"ap161204.html\">Orion</a>.\n\nThe star that predominantly illuminates and heats the dust is  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii\">Nu Scorpii</a>, visible as the reddened star left of center.",
