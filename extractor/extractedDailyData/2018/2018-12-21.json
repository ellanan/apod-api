  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWelcome to the December Solstice, the first day of winter in planet\nEarth's northern hemisphere and summer in the south.\n\nTo celebrate, consider this extraordinary display of\nbeautiful solar ice halos!\n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/\n2002/24oct_sunrings\">More common than rainbows</a>,\nsimple ice halos can be easy to spot, especially if you can\nshade your eyes from direct sunlight.\n\nStill it's extremely rare to see anything close to the\n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halosim.htm\">complex of halos</a>\npresent in this astounding scene.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.thehalovault.org/2018/12/\ncomplex-halo-display-borlange-sweden.html\">Captured at lunchtime</a>\non a cold December 14 near Utendal, Sweden the\nimage includes the relatively ordinary 22 degree halo,\nsundogs (parhelia) and sun pillars.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fza164.htm\">The extensive array of\nrarer halos</a> has been identified along with\n<a href=\"https://www.taivaanvahti.fi/observations/show/79745#2\">previously\nunknown features</a>.\n\nAll the patterns are generated as sunlight\n<a href=\"ap150403.html\">(or moonlight)</a> is reflected and refracted\nin flat six-sided water ice crystals in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIn this case, likely local contributors to the atmospheric\nice crystals are snow making machines operating at a nearby ski center.",
