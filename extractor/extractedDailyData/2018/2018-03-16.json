  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSeen as a seagull and a duck, these nebulae are\nnot the only\n<a href=\"ap080719.html\">cosmic clouds</a> to\n<a href=\"ap090910.html\">evoke images</a> of flight.\n\nBut both are winging their way across this broad\ncelestial landscape, spanning almost 7 degrees across\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/\">planet Earth's night sky</a>\ntoward the constellation\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/\ncanismajor.html\">Canis Major</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap090327.html\">expansive Seagull</a>\n(top center)\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/113243238@N08/38742044570/\">is\nitself composed of</a>\ntwo major cataloged\n<a href=\"ap050930.html\">emission nebulae</a>.\n\nBrighter NGC 2327 forms the head with the more diffuse\nIC 2177 as the wings and body.\n\nImpressively, the Seagull's\nwingspan would correspond to about 250 light-years at\nthe nebula's estimated distance of 3,800 light-years.\n\nAt the lower right, the Duck appears much more compact and\nwould span only about 50 light-years given its\n15,000 light-year distance estimate.\n\nBlown by energetic winds from an extremely massive,\nhot star near its center, the Duck nebula is cataloged\nas NGC 2359.\n\nOf course, the Duck's thick body and winged appendages\nalso lend it the slightly more dramatic popular moniker,\n<a href=\"ap080117.html\">Thor's Helmet</a>.",
