  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere do Perseid meteors come from?\n\nMostly small bits of stony grit, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/small-bodies/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/\">Perseid meteoroids</a> were once expelled from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a> and continue to follow this comet's orbit as they slowly disperse.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/Perseids\">featured animation</a> depicts the entire meteoroid stream as it orbits \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">our Sun</a>. \n\nWhen the Earth nears this stream, as it does every year, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids\">Perseid Meteor Shower</a> occurs. \n\nHighlighted as bright in the animation, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/images/pia13622.html\">comet debris</a> \nthis size is usually so dim it is practically undetectable. \n\nOnly a small fraction of this debris will enter the <a href=\"https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/22_earth-atmosphere-layers.jpg\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, heat up and \n<a href=\"ap011118.html\">disintegrate brightly</a>. \n\nThis weekend promises some of the better skies to view \nthe <a href=\"ap170818.html\">Perseid shower</a> \nas well as <a href=\"http://cams.seti.org/FDL/\">other active showers</a> \nbecause the \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/54/phases-of-the-moon/\">new moon</a> will not only be faint, \nit will be completely absent from the sky for most of the night. \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/video/jpl-20180801-whatsuf-0001-180cc.mp4\">not outshining faint Perseids</a>, \nthe new moon will partially obstruct the Sun as a \n<a href=\"ap140430.html\">partial solar eclipse</a> will be \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/globe/2018-august-11\">visible from</a> some northern locations.",
