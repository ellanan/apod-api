  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy is the Sun so quiet?\n\nAs <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">the Sun</a> enters into a period of time known as a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/solar-minimum-is-coming\">Solar Minimum</a>, it is, as expected, showing fewer \n<a href=\"ap020718.html\">sunspots</a> and \n<a href=\"ap150629.html\">active regions</a> than usual.\n\nThe quietness is <a href=\"https://www.barkbusters.co.uk/images/articles/7a4120f095480e9f2a2ad2a165d90313.jpg\">somewhat unsettling</a>, though, as so far this year, most days show no sunspots at all.\n\nIn contrast, from 2011 - 2015, during \n<a href=\"ap140312.html\">Solar Maximum</a>, \nthe Sun displayed spots just about every day. \n\nMaxima and minima occur on an \n<a href=\"ap071203.html\">11-year cycle</a>, with the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/01apr_deepsolarminimum/\">last Solar Minimum</a> \nbeing the most quiet in a century. \n\nWill this current Solar Minimum \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/139189/are-we-headed-towards-another-deep-solar-minimum/\">go even deeper</a>?\n\nEven though the \n<a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/Cycle22Cycle23Cycle24big.gif\">Sun's activity</a> affects the Earth and its surroundings, \nno one knows for sure \n<a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/solar-cycle-24-status-and-solar-cycle-25-upcoming-forecast\">what the Sun will do next</a>, \nand the physics behind the processes remain an \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015LRSP...12....4H\">active topic of research</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/alittlefireworks.html\">featured image</a> was taken \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=29&amp;month=07&amp;year=2018\">three weeks ago</a> and shows that our Sun is busy even on a quiet day.\n\n<a href=\"ap140720.html\">Prominences</a> of hot \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)\">plasma</a>, \n<a href=\"ap160919.html\">some larger than the Earth</a>, \ndance continually and are most easily visible over the edge.",
