  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBy chance, a collision of two galaxies has created a surprisingly\nrecognizable shape on a cosmic scale,\n<a href=\"http://spacetelescope.org/images/potw1036a/\">The\nCartwheel Galaxy</a>.\n\nThe Cartwheel is part of a group of galaxies about 500 million\nlight years away in the constellation Sculptor.\n\nTwo smaller galaxies in the group are visible on the left.\n\nThe Cartwheel Galaxy's rim is an\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/cartwheel/\">immense\nring-like structure</a> 150,000 light\nyears in diameter composed of newly formed,\nextremely bright, massive stars.\n\n<a href=\"http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/\">When galaxies\ncollide</a> they pass through each other,\ntheir individual stars rarely coming into contact.\n\nStill, the galaxies' gravitational fields are seriously\ndistorted by the collision.\n\nIn fact, the ring-like shape\nis the result of the gravitational\ndisruption caused by a small intruder galaxy passing\nthrough a large one,\ncompressing the interstellar gas and dust and\ncausing a a star formation wave to move out from\nthe impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.\n\nIn this case the large galaxy may have originally been a spiral,\nnot unlike our <a href=\"ap080606.html\">own Milky Way</a>, transformed\ninto the wheel shape by the collision.\n\nBut ...\n<a href=\"ap970224.html\">what happened to the small intruder galaxy</a>?",
