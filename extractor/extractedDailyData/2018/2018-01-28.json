  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see?\n\nThe answer during the total lunar\n<a href=\"ap110625.html\">eclipse in 2011</a> was recorded in a dramatic time lapse\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/25808333\">video</a> from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan\">Tajikistan</a>.\n\nDuring a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_lunar_eclipse\">total lunar eclipse</a>, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, \ncausing the moon to fade dramatically.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap180120.html\">Moon never gets completely dark</a>, \nthough, since the Earth's atmosphere\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/refr.html\">refracts</a> some light.\n\nAs the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQeejHExrGI\">featured video</a> begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is a nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon.\n\nAs the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/moon\">Moon</a> becomes eclipsed and fades, the wind dies down and background stars can be seen reflected in foreground lake.\n\nMost spectacularly, the\n<a href=\"ap110617.html\">sky surrounding</a> the eclipsed moon\nsuddenly appears to be\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou6JNQwPWE0\">full of stars</a> and highlighted by the busy plane of our\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n\nThe sequence repeats with a closer view, and the final image shows the placement of the eclipsed Moon near the\n<a href=\"ap080719.html\">Eagle</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960829.html\">Swan</a>,\n<a href=\"ap110513.html\">Trifid</a>, and\n<a href=\"ap091006.html\">Lagoon</a> nebulas.\n\nNearly two hours after the eclipse started, the moon emerges from the Earth's shadow and its bright full \n<a href=\"https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-cat-glare-745763242.jpg\">glare</a> again dominates the sky.\n\nThis Wednesday another \n<a href=\"ap150929.html\">total lunar eclipse</a> will take place -- \nbut this one will be during a \n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/01/24/how-rare-is-the-all-in-one-supermoon-blue-moon-and-lunar-eclipse-really/\">rare</a>  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/super-blue-blood-moon-coming-jan-31\">Super Blue Blood Moon</a>.",
