  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe Earth's dark umbral shadow is shaped like a cone\n<a href=\"ap060909.html\">extending into space</a>.\n\nOf course its\n<a href=\"ap130425.html\">circular cross section</a>\nat the distance of the Moon is\nmore easily seen during a lunar eclipse.\n\nIn fact, in this composite telephoto image from Earth's night side\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4614\">on\nJanuary 31</a>, the Earth's shadow has taken on a reddish tinge.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.eclipsewise.com/oh/ec2018.html\">The extent</a>\nof the shadow along the lunar orbit\nis illustrated by aligning three frames taken just before the\nstart, near the middle of, and just after the end of the total eclipse\nphase that lasted about 76 minutes.\n\nAt the upper right and more easily seen during the eclipse's darker\ntotal phase is M44, one of the closest large star clusters.\n\nA mere 600 light-years away, M44 is also known as the Praesepe or the\n<a href=\"ap140222.html\">Beehive Cluster</a>.",
