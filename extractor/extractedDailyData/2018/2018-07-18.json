  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is creating these dark streaks on Mars?\n\nNo one is sure.\n\nCandidates include dust avalanches, evaporating \n<a href=\"ap110926.html\">dry ice</a> \n<a href=\"ap130617.html\">sleds</a>, and liquid water flows.\n \nWhat is clear is that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_slope_streak\">the streaks</a> occur through light surface dust and expose a deeper dark layer. \n\n<a href=\"ap100301.html\">Similar</a> \n<a href=\"ap110808.html\">streaks</a> have been photographed on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/\">Mars</a> \nfor years and are one of the few surface features that change their \n<a href=\"ap150930.html\">appearance seasonally</a>. \n\nParticularly interesting here is that larger streaks split \ninto smaller streaks further down the slope. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22240\">featured image</a> was taken by the \n<a href=\"https://www.uahirise.org/epo/about/\">HiRISE camera</a> on board the Mars-orbiting \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/mars-reconnaissance-orbiter-preparing-for-years-ahead\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (MRO) several months ago. \n\nCurrently, a \n<a href=\"ap180617.html\">global</a>  \n<a href=\"ap180616.html\">dust</a> \n<a href=\"ap180623.html\">storm</a> is encompassing much of Mars.",
