  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that spot next to the Moon? \n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/\">Venus</a>. \n\nTwo days ago, the crescent Moon slowly drifted past Venus, appearing \n<a href=\"http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/astrocal/astrocal2018est.html\">within just one degree</a> at its closest. \n\nThis <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)\">conjunction</a>, though, was just one of several \nphotographic adventures for our Moon this month \n\n(<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Does-the-origin-of-the-word-month-have-anything-to-do-with-the-word-moon\">moon-th</a>), \nbecause, for one, a partial solar eclipse occurred \n<a href=\"ap180714.html\">just a few days before</a>, on July 12.\n\nCurrently, the Moon appears to be brightening, as seen from the Earth, as the fraction of its face illuminated by the Sun continues to increase.  \n\nIn a few days, \n<a href=\"ap180328.html\">the Moon</a> \nwill appear more than half full, and therefore be in its \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/54/phases-of-the-moon/\">gibbous phase</a>. \n\nNext week the face of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> \nthat always faces \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a> will become, as viewed from the Earth, completely illuminated by \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a>.\n\nEven this full phase will bring an adventure, though, as a total eclipse of this \n<a href=\"https://www.farmersalmanac.com/full-moon-names\">Thunder Moon</a> will occur on July 27.  \n\nDon't worry about \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(goddess)\">our Luna</a> getting tired, though, because she'll be new again next month (moon-th) -- August 11 to be exact -- just as she causes another partial eclipse of the Sun. \n\nPictured,  \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/todays-image/photos-venus-mercury-moon-july-2018\">Venus and the Moon were captured</a> from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nSUVa_fPC0\">Cannon Beach</a> above a rock formation off the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\">Oregon</a> \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>) \ncoast known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haystack_Rock#/media/File:The_needles_at_Cannon_beach.jpg\">the Needles</a>. \n\nAbout an hour after this image was taken, \nthe spin of the Earth caused both \n<a href=\"ap100516.html\">Venus and the Moon</a> to \n<a href=\"ap180604.html\">set</a>.",
