  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThere's a \"camera\" comet now moving across the sky.\n\nJust a bit too dim to see with the unaided eye, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21P/Giacobini%E2%80%93Zinner\">Comet 21P / Giacobini-Zinner</a> has developed a \n<a href=\"ap180913.html\">long tail</a> \nthat makes it a good sight for binoculars and sensitive cameras.\n\nThe movement of the \n<a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/comet-21p-giacobini-zinner-shines-in-september/\">Comet 21P</a> on the sky was captured last week in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R60m1W7t1og\">featured time-lapse video</a> compressing 90 minutes into about 2.5 seconds.\n\nWhat might seem odd is that the \n<a href=\"ap180823.html\">21P's tail</a> is not following the comet's movement.\n\nThis is because \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/tails-of-wonder/\">comet tails</a> always point away from the Sun, and \n<a href=\"http://www.calsky.com/?Comets=&amp;sec=3&amp;step=1&amp;number=21P\">the comet</a> was not moving toward \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/by-the-numbers/\">the Sun</a> during the period photographed.\n\nVisible far in the background on the upper left is the Salt &amp; Pepper star cluster, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_37\">M37</a>, while the bright red star \n<a href=\"https://www.universeguide.com/star/v440aurigae\">V440 Auriga</a> is visible just about the frame's center.\n\nThis 2-km ball of \n<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0126/What-is-comet-dust-made-of-Rosetta-finds-out\">dust-shedding ice</a> \npassed its nearest to the Sun and Earth only last week \nand is now fading as it \n<a href=\"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&amp;body_group=sb&amp;sstr=21P\">crosses into southern skies</a>. \n\nComet 21P should remain visible, however, and photogenic to \n<a href=\"ap120508.html\">stabilized cameras</a>, for another month or so.",
