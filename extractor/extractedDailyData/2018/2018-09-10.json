  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIf you could stand on Mars -- what might you see?\n\nIf you were NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/overview/index.html\">Curiosity rover</a>, just last month you would have seen \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/mars/curiosity-deck-panorama-at-stoer.html\">the view from Vera Rubin Ridge</a>, an \n<a href=\"http://redplanet.asu.edu/?p=30760\">intriguing rock-strewn perch</a> \non the side of \n<a href=\"ap160502.html\">Mount Sharp</a>.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJLZfPiyfc\">featured 360-degree panorama</a>, you can spin around and take in \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2018-209\">the vista</a> from all directions, \nin many browsers, just by pointing or \n<a href=\"https://iheartdogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0115.jpg\">tilting</a>. \n\nIn this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality\">virtual reality</a> view, many instruments on \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)\">the rover</a> are labelled, including antennas, the robotic arm, and the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/technologiesofbroadbenefit/power/\">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a> (RTG).\n\nDark sand and light rock cover the ground nearby in a mixture called lakebed mudstone.\n\nTowering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sharp\">Mount Sharp</a> is only barely visible in the distance due to airborne dust from a \n<a href=\"ap180617.html\">planet-wide storm</a> just winding down.\n\nAmong its \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/interactives/msl-science-discoveries/\">many discoveries</a>, Curiosity has found that the \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/nasa-rover-hits-organic-pay-dirt-mars\">raw ingredients for life</a> are present on Mars. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJtjJSHsm9c\">Next on Mars</a> will be NASA's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InSight\">Insight</a>, on target \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/\">to land</a> in late November, \nwhich is scheduled to deploy a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer\">seismometer</a> \nto better study the interior of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">red planet</a>.",
