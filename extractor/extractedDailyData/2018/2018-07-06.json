  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA darkened and mysterious north polar region\n<a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/\npluto-moon-charon-formal-names/\">known to some as</a>\nMordor Macula caps this premier high-resolution view.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/\npluto-s-big-moon-charon-reveals-a-colorful-and-violent-history\">The\nportrait of Charon</a>, Pluto's largest moon,\nwas captured by New Horizons near the spacecraft's closest\napproach on July 14, 2015.\n\n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/\nimage.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=323\">The combined blue, red,\nand infrared</a> data was processed to enhance colors\nand follow variations in Charon's surface properties\nwith a resolution of about 2.9 kilometers (1.8 miles).\n\nA stunning image of Charon's Pluto-facing hemisphere, it also\nfeatures a clear view of an apparently\n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/\">moon-girdling</a> belt of\nfractures and canyons that seems to\nseparate smooth southern plains from varied northern terrain.\n\nCharon is 1,214 kilometers (754 miles) across.\n\nThat's about 1/10th the size of planet Earth\nbut a whopping 1/2 the diameter of\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/\nhow-big-is-pluto-new-horizons-settles-decades-long-debate\">Pluto\nitself</a>, and makes it the largest satellite relative to its\nparent body in the Solar System.\n\nStill, the moon appears as a small bump at about the 1 o'clock position\non Pluto's disk in the grainy, negative,telescopic picture inset\nat upper left.\n\nThat view was used by James Christy and Robert Harrington\nat the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff to\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/\ncharon-at-40-four-decades-of-discovery-on-pluto-s-largest-moon\">discover\nCharon 40 years ago in June of 1978</a>.",
