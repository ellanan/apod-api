  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat creates the colors in Jupiter's clouds?\n\nNo one is sure. \n\nThe thick atmosphere of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a> \nis mostly \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\">hydrogen</a> and \n<a href=\"https://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele002.html\">helium</a>, elements which are colorless at the low temperatures of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter\">Jovian cloud tops</a>.\n\nWhich trace elements provide the colors remains a \n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9F6bOIK7R-A/T3IHV6JBmWI/AAAAAAAALKU/Mib41Ua5Ujs/s1600/Dog_teacher.jpg\">topic of research</a>, although small amounts of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_hydrosulfide\">ammonium hydrosulfide</a> are \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Icar..302..418L\">one leading candidate</a>. \n\nWhat is clear from the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/jupiter/swirls-and-vortices.html\">featured color-enhanced image</a> -- and many similar images -- is that lighter clouds are typically higher up than darker ones.\n\nPictured, \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/chaotic-clouds-of-jupiter\">light clouds swirl</a> around \n<a href=\"ap171214.html\">reddish regions</a> toward the lower right, \nwhile they appear to cover over some darker domains on the upper right.\n\nThe featured image was taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html\">Juno</a> spacecraft during its \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qV_2y-BLEr4\">14th low pass over Jupiter</a> \nearlier this year. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\">Juno</a> continues in its looping elliptical orbit, \n<a href=\"ap180226.html\">swooping near the huge planet</a> \nevery 53 days and exploring a slightly different sector each time around.",
