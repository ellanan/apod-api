  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSure, you've seen Saturn's rings -- but have you ever <i> heard </i> them?\n\nWell then please take this opportunity to play \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>'s rings like a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harp\">harp</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://www.system-sounds.com/saturn-harp/\">featured sonification</a>, increasing brighter regions of Saturn's central \n<a href=\"ap161124.html\">B-ring</a> play as increasingly higher \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)\">pitch</a>ed notes.\n\nWith a computer browser, click anywhere on the image to begin, \nand pluck consecutive strings by sliding the spacecraft icon's \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet92/images/b92kohf4.gif\">magnetometer boom</a> across the strings.  \n\nBoth manual and automatic \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fwxBSW3MzU\">modes</a> are possible. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21628\">featured natural-color image</a> was taken by the \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/\">late</a>  \n<a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/the-journey/the-spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> in 2017 July as it \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/cassini-finds-the-big-empty-close-to-saturn\">grazed</a> Saturn's rings and took the highest-resolution ring images ever. \n\nThe reason why the mostly \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/saturn-rings/en/\">water-ice rings</a> have a tan hue -- instead of \n<a href=\"ap091208.html\">white</a> -- is currently a topic of research. \n\nPlayed in <a href=\"https://www.studybass.com/lessons/bass-scales/the-difference-between-major-and-minor/\">minor</a> harmony, a \n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21628\">different false-color version</a> of the same image appears where regions with a greater abundance of water ice appears more red.",
