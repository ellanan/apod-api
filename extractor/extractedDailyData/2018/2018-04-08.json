  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTen thousand years ago, before the dawn of recorded human history, \na new light would have suddenly have appeared in the \nnight sky and faded after a few weeks.  \n\nToday we know this light was from a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">supernova,\nor exploding star</a>,\nand record the expanding debris cloud as the \n<a href=\"ap121126.html\">Veil Nebula</a>, a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernova_remnants\">supernova remnant</a>.  \n\nThis sharp telescopic view is centered on a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cygnus_Loop_Labeled.png\">western\nsegment</a> of the \nVeil Nebula cataloged as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalog\">NGC</a> 6960 but less formally known as the Witch's Broom Nebula.  \n\nBlasted out in the cataclysmic explosion, the interstellar shock wave plows\nthrough space sweeping up and exciting interstellar material.\n\nImaged with narrow band filters, the \n<a href=\"ap170919.html\">glowing filaments</a> are\nlike long ripples in a sheet seen almost edge on,\nremarkably well separated into atomic hydrogen (red)\nand oxygen (blue-green) gas.\n\nThe complete supernova remnant lies about 1400\n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/\nquestion19.html\">light-years</a> away towards the\n<a href=\"ap101119.html\">constellation Cygnus</a>.\n\nThis Witch's <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/1/1e/Houki-constructionworker-japan-2012.ogv/Houki-constructionworker-japan-2012.ogv.480p.webm\">Broom</a> actually spans about 35 light-years.\n\nThe bright star in the frame is \n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/52cyg.html\">52 Cygni</a>,\nvisible with the unaided eye from \na dark location but unrelated to the ancient supernova remnant.",
