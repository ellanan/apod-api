  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happened to the Sun?  \n\nSometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a giant  \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)\">lens</a>.  \n\nIn the featured video, however, there are actually millions of tiny lenses: \n<a href=\"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/halos/halos.htm\">ice crystals</a>. \n\nWater may freeze in the  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/463940main_atmosphere-layers2_full.jpg\">atmosphere</a> into small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals. \n\nAs these <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystal\">crystals</a> flutter to the ground, much time is spent\nwith their \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/orplate.htm\">faces flat and parallel</a> to the ground. \n\nAn <a href=\"http://littlefun.org/uploads/52410bb8e691b267f97d9278_736.jpg\">observer</a> may find themselves in the same plane as \nmany of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset. \n\nDuring this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, \nrefracting sunlight into our \n<a href=\"ap100208.html\">view</a> and creating \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parhelia.htm\">phenomena like parhelia</a>, the technical term for \n<a href=\"ap990823.html\">sundogs</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hakanhf/videos/10210053095156104/\">featured video</a> was taken a month ago \non the side of a ski hill at the \n<a href=\"https://www.skistar.com/en/Vemdalen/About-Vemdalen/\">Vemdalen Ski Resort</a> in central  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden\">Sweden</a>.\n\nVisible in the center is the most direct image of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun\">Sun</a>, while two bright \n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/ice/sd.rxml\">sundogs</a> glow prominently from both the left and the right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/halo.html\">Also visible</a> is the bright\n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/halo22.html\">22 degree halo</a> -- as well as the rarer and much fainter \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/46hal.htm\">46 degree halo</a> -- \nalso created by \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circular.htm\">sunlight refracting</a> through atmospheric ice \n<a href=\"ap080618.html\">crystals</a>.",
