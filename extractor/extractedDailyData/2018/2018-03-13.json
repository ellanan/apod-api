  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs it possible to capture the entire plane of our galaxy in a single image?\n\nYes, but not in one exposure -- and it took some planning to do it in two.\n\nThe top part of the \n<a href=\"https://moophz.com/photography/astroscapes#prettyPhoto[gallery1]/0/\">featured image</a> is the night sky above \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon\">Lebanon</a>, \nnorth of the equator, taken in 2017 June.\n\nThe image was taken at a time when the central band of the \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> passed directly overhead.\n\nThe bottom half was similarly captured six months later in \n<a href=\"https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-latitude-and-longitude.html\">latitude</a>-opposite \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>, south of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/equator_.png\">Earth's equator</a>.\n\nEach image therefore captured the night sky in \n<a href=\"https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/two-dogs-looking-in-opposite-directions-picture-id107883201\">exactly the opposite direction</a> of the other, when fully half the Galactic plane was visible.\n\nThe southern half was then inverted -- car and all -- and digitally \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcrEqIpi6sg\">appended</a> \nto the top half to show the entire central \n<a href=\"ap110710.html\">band of our Galaxy</a>, as a circle, in a single image. \n\nMany stars and nebulas are visible, with the \n<a href=\"ap150827.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> \nbeing particularly notable inside the lower half of the complete galactic circle.",
