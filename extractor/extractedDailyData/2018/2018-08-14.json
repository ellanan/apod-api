  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs there a bridge of gas connecting these two great galaxies?\n\nQuite possibly, but it is hard to be sure. \n\n<a href=\"ap080425.html\">M86</a> on the upper left is a giant \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a> near the center of the nearby \n<a href=\"ap170624.html\">Virgo Cluster</a> of galaxies.  \n\nOur Milky Way Galaxy is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgocentric_flow\">falling toward the Virgo Cluster</a>, \nlocated about 50 million \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> away.\n\nTo the lower right of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_86\">M86</a> \nis unusual spiral galaxy NGC 4438, which, \ntogether with angular neighbor NGC 4435, are known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Galaxies\">Eyes Galaxies</a> \n(also Arp 120).\n\n<a href=\"https://www.hansonastronomy.com/m86-group\">Featured here</a> is one of the deeper images yet taken of the region, \nindicating that red-glowing gas surrounds M86 and \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...687L..69K\">seemingly connects</a> it to NGC 4438.\n\nThe image spans about the size of the full moon. \n\nIt is also known, however, that \n<a href=\"https://www.cosmotography.com/images/galactic_cirrus.html\">cirrus gas</a> in our \n<a href=\"ap100322.html\">own Galaxy</a> is \n<a href=\"ap180108.html\">superposed in front</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap050926.html\">Virgo cluster</a>, \nand observations of the low speed of this gas \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.403L..26C\">seem more consistent</a> with this Milky Way origin hypothesis.\n\nA definitive answer may come from \n<a href=\"http://www.eclipsechaser.com/eclink/image/ecmisc/mosquess.jpg\">future research</a>, which may also \nresolve how the extended blue arms of NGC 4438 were created.",
