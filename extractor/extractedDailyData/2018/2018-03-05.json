  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you heard about the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field? \n\nEither way, you've likely not \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/33/63/f6/3363f6be8a0b534cd852395723dd6700.jpg\">heard about it like this</a> -- please run your pointer over the featured image and listen! \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field\">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> (HUDF) was created in 2003-2004 with the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> staring for a \nlong time toward near-empty space so that distant, \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/science/deep_fields/\">faint galaxies</a> would become visible. \n\nOne of the most famous images in astronomy, the \n<a href=\"ap040309.html\">HUDF</a> is featured here in a vibrant way -- \nwith sonified distances.\n\nPointing to a galaxy will play a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note\">note</a> that indicates its approximate redshift.\n\nBecause \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U4O8XB14tg\">redshift</a>s \nshift light toward the red end of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro\">spectrum of light</a>, \nthey are depicted here by a shift of tone toward the low end of the \n<a href=\"http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/sound.spectrum.html\">spectrum of sound</a>. \n\nThe further the galaxy, the greater its \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">cosmological redshift</a> (even if it appears blue), and the lower the tone that will be played.\n\nThe average galaxy in the \n<a href=\"ap130827.html\">HUDF</a> is about 10.6 billion \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away and sounds like an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies\">F#</a>.\n\nWhat's the most distant galaxy you can find? \n\nThis Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is based on \n<a href=\"http://astrosom.com/Jan2018.php\">an entry</a> of new site called \n<a href=\"http://astrosom.com/index.php\">Astronomy Sound of the Month</a> (AstroSoM).",
