  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe five naked-eye planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn,\nhave been seen since ancient times to wander the night skies of planet Earth.\n\nSo it could be remarkable that on this night,\nstanding at the side of a clear, calm lake, six planets\ncan be seen with the unaided eye.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mediacast/jpl/whats-up-june-2018\">Have a\nlook.</a>\n\nVery bright and easy to spot for skygazers, yellowish Mars\nis left of a pale Milky Way.\n\nSaturn is immersed in the glow of the Milky Way's diffuse starlight.\n\nJupiter is very near the horizon on the right, shining beyond the\ntrees against the glow of distant city lights.\n\nLast weekend, while admiring this night time view across beautiful,\nhigh-altitude Lake Tenaya in Yosemite National Park, a\n<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32540/32540-h/32540-h.htm\">thoughtful\nand reflective</a> observer could probably\n<a href=\"image/1806/RBA_yosemitesixLabel.jpg\">see three planets more</a>.",
