  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happened to the Moon?\n\nNothing, but something has happened to the <i>image</i> of the Moon.\n\nThe heat from a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava#/media/File:Lava_fountain_at_Kilauea.jpg\">volcanic lava fountain</a> in the foreground has warmed and made\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence\">turbulent</a> \nthe air nearby, causing passing light to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction\">refract</a> differently than usual.\n\nThe result is a \n<a href=\"ap170426.html\">lava plume</a> that appears to be \n<a href=\"http://www.acoolthingilearnedtoday.com/why-does-chocolate-melt-in-your-mouth/\">melting</a> the Moon.\n\nThe featured picture was taken as the full \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon\">Sturgeon</a> Moon was \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPIeMVORS4o\">setting</a> behind \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rznju2ivzfU\">Mt. Etna</a> as it \n<a href=\"ap030416.html\">erupted</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a> about one week ago.\n\nThe picture is actually a \n<a href=\"https://jokideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Cat-Optical-Illusion.jpg\">composite of two</a> images, \none taken right after the other, with the same camera and lens. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"image/1809/MoonPlumeBefore_Pace_4672.jpg\">first image</a> \nwas a quick exposure to capture details of the setting Moon, while the \n<a href=\"image/1809/MoonPlumeAfter_Pace_4672.jpg\">second exposure</a><a>, \ntaken after the Moon set a few minutes later, \nwas longer so as to capture details of the faint lava jets.\n\nFrom our Earth, we can only see the \n</a><a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a>, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">Moon</a>, planets, and stars as they appear through the distortion of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nThis distortion can not only change the images of familiar orbs into \n<a href=\"ap090223.html\">unusual</a> \n<a href=\"ap111010.html\">shapes</a>, it can --unexpectedly at times -- \n<a href=\"https://aty.sdsu.edu/explain/sunset_time.html\">delay sunset</a> \nand moonset by several minutes.",
