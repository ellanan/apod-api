  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOn the International Space Station (ISS), \nyou can only admire an aurora until the sun rises.\n\nThen the background Earth becomes too bright. \n\nUnfortunately, after \n<a href=\"ap170502.html\">sunset</a>, the rapid orbit of the ISS around the Earth means that sunrise is usually less than  \n<a href=\"https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/mcc/sts-111/06_09_07_06_11.html\">47 minutes</a> away. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/the-aurora-and-the-sunrise\">featured image</a>, a green aurora is visible below the \n<a href=\"ap161105.html\">ISS</a> -- and on the horizon to the upper right, while sunrise approaches ominously from the upper left. \n\nWatching an aurora from space can be \n<a href=\"https://c7.alamy.com/comp/DRY9W4/white-cat-mesmerized-by-goldfish-in-a-fish-tank-DRY9W4.jpg\">mesmerizing</a> as its changing shape has been compared to a giant green <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pR7TNzJ_pA\">amoeba</a>. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL_-Zz7JDoA\">Auroras</a> are composed of energetic electrons and protons from the Sun that impact the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/Earths-magneticfieldlines-dipole.html\">Earth's magnetic field</a> and then \nspiral down toward the Earth so fast that they cause \n<a href=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/atmosphere.jpg\">atmospheric</a> atoms and molecules to glow. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap151109.html\">ISS</a> orbits at nearly \nthe same height as auroras, many times \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/flying-through-an-aurora\">flying right through an aurora</a>'s thin upper layers, \nan event that neither harms astronauts nor \n<a href=\"ap110328.html\">changes the shape</a> of the aurora.",
