  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTypically, the International Space Station is visible only at night. \n\nSlowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) can be seen as a \n<a href=\"ap110314.html\">bright spot</a> about once a month from many locations. \n\n<a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/faq.cfm\">The ISS</a> is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, it will drop out of sight.\n\nThe only occasion when the \n<a href=\"ap160513.html\">ISS is visible during the day</a> is when it \n<a href=\"ap190715.html\">passes right in front of the Sun</a>.\n\nThen, it passes so quickly that only cameras \ntaking short exposures can visually freeze the \n<a href=\"ap150912.html\">ISS's silhouette</a> onto the background \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/astrofotografiarafaela/photos/a.407916176064535/1110171379172341/?type=3&amp;theater\">featured picture</a> did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIpceivSPY0\">Santa Fe</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina\">Argentina</a> with perfect timing. \n\nThis image series was later combined with a separate image \nhighlighting the texture of the spotless Sun, and an image bringing up the \n<a href=\"ap180618.html\">Sun's prominences</a> around the edge.\n\nAt an unusually low \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/solar-minimum-is-coming\">Solar Minimum</a>, the Sun has gone \n<a href=\"https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/solar-activity/solar-cycle\">without sunspots</a> now for most of 2019.",
