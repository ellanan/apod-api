  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nArcing toward southern skies in late March,\n<a href=\"http://www.qsl.net/ah6l/A2.html\">this faint comet LINEAR</a> -\nthe one officially\n<a href=\"http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~weaver/nova/\nnaming_convention.html\">designated</a> C/2001 A2 (LINEAR) -\nbrightened unexpectedly.\n\nThe outburst, apparently due to\n<a href=\"ap010521.html\">the fragmentation</a> of its nucleus,\ndelighted observers as the comet eventually increased to\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomynotes.com/nakedeye/nakedeya.htm\">naked-eye</a>\nbrightness.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html\">Comet</a>\nLINEAR's tail also grew and in\n<a href=\"http://members.ozemail.com.au/~loomberah/\nlinear.htm\">this mosaic of images</a> from\nMay 18, astronomer Gordon Garradd has carefully followed the fluorescing\nfilaments of LINEAR's gas tail stretching 1.5 degrees (the width of\nthree full moons) along the anti-sunward\n<a href=\"ap980220.html\">direction</a>.\n\nThe inset close-up near the top clearly shows two bright condensations\nin the\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/education/igcomet/igcomet.html\">cometary</a>\ncoma, indicating the presence of a split nucleus.\n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2001a2.html\">This comet LINEAR</a>\nmade its closest approach to the Sun on May 24.\n\nStill <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#01A2\">showing\noff</a> for southern skygazers at about 5th magnitude, it\nwill become more easily visible for northern observers by late June.",
