  "title": "A Setting Sun Trail",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Sun appears to move on the sky because the \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">Earth rotates</a>.  \n\nThe extreme brightness of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a>, \nhowever, makes it difficult to capture a sun-trail -- \nthe path the Sun traces on the sky.  \n\nTo capture the <a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/misc019.html\">above picture</a>, a very \n<a href=\"http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/eclipse/990811/text/eclipse-photography.html\">dark filter</a> covered the camera lens for most of the time, \nallowing only a trifle of light from the bright \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> to peek through.   \n\nJust after the <a href=\"ap020709.html\">Sun</a> had dipped below the \n<a href=\"ap000320.html\">horizon</a> \nbut before it was completely dark, \nthe thick filter was removed and the \n<a href=\"ap010527.html\">pretty foreground scene</a> \nwas captured.  \n\nSlight <a href=\"ap000403.html\">flares</a> \nappeared when the Sun went behind thin clouds.  \n\n<a href=\"ap000905.html\">Star-trails</a> and \n<a href=\"ap020510.html\">planet-trails</a> \nare much easier to image, and a similar \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/misc006.html\">Moon trail</a> has also recently been imaged.",
