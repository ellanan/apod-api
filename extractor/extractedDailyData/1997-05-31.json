The rings have several large gaps, the largest of\nwhich is clearly visible in the picture and is named the \n<a href=\"http://ringside.arc.nasa.gov/www/saturn/saturn.html\">Cassini \nDivision</a>, after its \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/people/enlightenment/cassini.html\">discoverer</a>.  \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/vgrsat.htm\">Saturn</a> \nappears brighter than most stars in the sky,\nand its rings can be discerned with a small telescope. \nA new spacecraft - \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/\">Cassini</a> - will visit \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm\">Saturn</a> \nand is currently scheduled for launch later in 1997.",
