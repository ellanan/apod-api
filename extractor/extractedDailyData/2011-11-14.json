  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe longer you look at\n<a href=\"http://www.nuitsacrees.fr/DP/AP/apskogar_1200.jpg\">this image</a>, the more you see.\n\nPerhaps your eye is first drawn to the picturesque waterfall called\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogarfoss\">Skogarfoss</a>\nvisible on the image right.\n\nJust as prevalent, however, in this\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a>ic visual extravaganza, is the colorful arc of light on the left.  \n\nThis <a href=\"ap010704.html\">chromatic bow</a> is not a rainbow, since the water drops did not originate in rainfall nor are they\n<a href=\"http://www.cbu.edu/~jvarrian/applets/rainbow1/rainbo_z.htm\">reflecting light</a> from the Sun.\n\nRather, the drops have drifted off from\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbVc7RdOcFw\">the waterfall</a> and are now illuminated by the nearly\n<a href=\"ap070603.html\">full Moon</a>.\n\nHigh above are the faint green streaks of\n<a href=\"ap071119.html\">aurora</a>.\n\nThe scene, captured one night last month, also shows a beautiful starscape far in the background, including the\n<a href=\"ap110624.html\">Big Dipper</a>, part of the constellation of the Great Bear\n(<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/uma/index.html\">Ursa Major</a>).",
