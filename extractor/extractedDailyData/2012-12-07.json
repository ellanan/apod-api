  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis remarkably complete\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/\nview.php?id=79765\">view of Earth at night</a> is a composite\nof cloud-free, nighttime images.\n\nThe images were collected during April and October 2012\nby the Suomi-NPP satellite from polar orbit about 824 kilometers\n(512 miles) above the surface using\nits Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite\n(<a href=\"http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/viirs.html\">VIIRS</a>).\n\nVIIRS offers greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to\n<a href=\"ap081005.html\">past global nightlight</a> detecting instrumentation\non DMSP satellites.\n\nIt also has advantages\n<a href=\"ap120829.html\">compared to cameras</a> on the International\nSpace Station.\n\nWhile the space station passes over the same point on Earth\nevery two or three days, Suomi-NPP passes\nover the same point twice a day at about 1:30am and 1:30pm\nlocal time.\n\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/IntotheBlack/\npage4.php\">Easy to recognize here</a>,\ncity lights identify major population centers,\ntracking the effects of human activity and influence across the globe.\n\nThat makes\n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/NightLights/\">nighttime\nimages of our fair planet</a> among the most interesting\nand important\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/\nearth-at-night.html\">views from space</a>.",
