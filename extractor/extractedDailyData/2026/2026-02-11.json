  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow many \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/sunspots/\">sunspots</a> can you see? \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTHxItFjaUe/\">central image</a> shows the many sunspots that occurred in 2025, month by month around the circle, and all together in the grand central image. \n\nEach <a href=\"ap230517.html\">sunspot</a> is magnetically cooled and so appears dark -- and can last from days to months.\n\nAlthough the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTHxItFjaUe/\">featured images</a> originated from \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>,\nsunspots can be easily seen with a small telescope or \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars#/media/File:Binocularp.svg\">binoculars</a> equipped with a \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/optics-filters\">solar filter</a>.\n\nVery large sunspot groups like \n<a href=\"ap260208.html\">recent AR 4366</a> can even be seen with \n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/are-your-solar-eclipse-glasses-safe\">eclipse glasses</a>.\n\nSunspots are still \n<a href=\"https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/dayssnplot\">counted by eye</a>, \nbut the total number is not considered exact \nbecause they frequently \n<a href=\"ap150629.html\">change and break up</a>. \n\nLast year, 2025, coincided with a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-noaa-sun-reaches-maximum-phase-in-11-year-solar-cycle/\">solar maximum</a>, the period of most \nintense magnetic activity during its 11-year \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-cycles/\">solar cycle</a>. \n\nOur Sun remains \n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AgzTBzVXY_w/hq720.jpg\">unpredictable</a> in many ways, \nincluding when it ejects \n<a href=\"ap180902.html\">solar flare</a>s that will impact the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/\">Earth</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/yearlyssnplot\">how active</a> \nthe next solar cycle will be.",
