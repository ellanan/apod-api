  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nMost galaxies don't have any rings -- why does this galaxy have three? \n\nTo begin, a ring that's near \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1512\">NGC 1512</a>'s center -- \nand so hard to see here -- is the \n<a href=\"ap170710.html\">nuclear ring</a> \nwhich glows brightly with recently formed \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/\">stars</a>. \n\nNext out is a ring of stars and \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain\">dust</a> appearing both red and blue, called, \n<a href=\"https://ru.fishki.net/picsw/112007/29/ugol/ugol_012.jpg\">counter-intuitively</a>, the inner ring. \n\nThis <a href=\"ap220508.html\">inner ring</a> connects ends of a diffuse \n<a href=\"ap221016.html\">central bar</a> \nof stars that runs horizontally across the galaxy. \n\nFarthest out in this wide field image is a \nragged structure that might be considered an outer ring.\n\nThis outer ring appears spiral-like and is dotted with \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster\">clusters</a> of bright blue stars. \n\nAll these ring structures are thought to be affected by \n<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2403i/\">NGC 1512</a>'s own gravitational asymmetries in a drawn-out process called \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/s/Secular+Evolution\">secular</a> \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ARA%26A..42..603K/abstract\">evolution</a>. \n\nThe featured image was captured last month from a telescope at \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/i-qdANr8z3Y\">Deep Sky Chile</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.",
