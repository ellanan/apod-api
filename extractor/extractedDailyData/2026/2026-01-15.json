  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThe dark-floored, 95 kilometer wide crater Plato and sunlit peaks of the\n<a href=\"https://lroc.im-ldi.com/images/714\">lunar Alps</a>\n(Montes Alpes) are highlighted in this\n<a href=\"https://app.astrobin.com/u/Luigi_morrone_1979?i=okquoj#gallery\">this\nsharp telescopic snapshot</a> of the Moon's surface.\n\nWhile the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps\">Alps</a>\nof planet Earth were uplifted over millions of\nyears as continental plates slowly collided, the lunar Alps were likely\nformed by a sudden collision that created the giant\n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/orbiter/lunar_orbiter/impact_basin/\">impact basin</a>\nknown as the <a href=\"ap001228.html\">Mare Imbrium</a> or Sea of Rains.\n\nThe mare's generally smooth, lava-flooded floor is seen\nbelow the bordering mountain range.\n\nThe prominent straight feature cutting through the mountains\nis the <a href=\"https://lroc.im-ldi.com/images/55\">lunar Alpine Valley</a> (Vallis Alpes).\n\nJoining the Mare Imbrium and northern Mare Frigoris (Sea of Cold)\nthe valley extends toward the upper right, about 160 kilometers long\nand up to 10 kilometers wide.\n\nOf course, the large, bright\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc_(Moon)\">lunar alpine</a>\nmountain below and right of Plato crater is named\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-observatory/mt-blanc-3620/\">Mont Blanc</a>.\n\nLacking an atmosphere, not to mention <a href=\"ap050224.html\">snow</a>,\nthe lunar Alps are probably not an ideal location for a winter\n<a href=\"ap010713.html\">vacation</a>.\n\nStill, a 150 pound skier\n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/weight/index.html\">would\nweigh</a> a mere 25 pounds\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis/\">on the Moon</a>.",
