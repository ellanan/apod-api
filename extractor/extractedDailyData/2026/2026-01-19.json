  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat powers this unusual nebula?\n\nCTB 1 is the expanding gas shell that was left when a massive star toward the constellation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)\">Cassiopeia</a> \nexploded about 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe star likely detonated when it ran out of elements, near its core, that could create \n<a href=\"http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph241/olson1/\">stabilizing pressure</a> with \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion\">nuclear fusion</a>.\n\nThe resulting \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant\">supernova remnant</a>, nicknamed the Medulla Nebula for its \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata\">brain-like shape</a>, still glows in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\">visible light</a> \nbecause of the heat generated by its collision with confining \n<a href=\"ap130924.html\">interstellar gas</a>. \n\nWhy \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASJ...70..110K/abstract\">the nebula</a> also glows in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">X-ray light</a>, though, \n<a href=\"https://www.barkbusters.co.uk/images/articles/7a4120f095480e9f2a2ad2a165d90313.jpg\">remains a topic of research</a>.\n\nOne hypothesis holds that an energetic\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar\">pulsar</a> \nwas created and powers the nebula with a fast outwardly moving wind.\n\nFollowing this lead, a pulsar was \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019sros.confE.158K/abstract\">found</a> in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio waves</a> \nthat appears to have \n<a href=\"ap190813.html\">been expelled</a> by the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aysiMbgml5g\">supernova explosion</a> \nat over 1000 kilometers per second. \n\nAlthough the <a href=\"https://www.gxccd.com/art?id=543&amp;cat=1&amp;lang=409\">Medulla Nebula</a> appears as large as a \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">full moon</a>, \nit is so faint that it took 84-hours of exposure with \na small telescope in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\">Texas</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>, to create the \n<a href=\"https://app.astrobin.com/u/konzy?i=tvj0k3#gallery\">featured image</a>.",
