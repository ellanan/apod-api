  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSometimes, after your eyes adapt to the dark, a spectacular sky appears.\n\nSuch was the case earlier this month when one of the \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/aurora/gallery_01mar11.htm\">largest auroral displays</a> in recent years appeared over northern locations like the border between Norway and Russia.\n\nPictured in the <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/21294655\">above time-lapse movie</a>, auroras flow over snow covered landscapes, trees, clouds, mountains and lakes found near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkenes\">Kirkenes</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\">Norway</a>.\n\nMany times the auroras are green, as high energy particles strike the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/912_liftoff_atm.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, causing the air to glow as electrons recombine with their \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a> hosts. \n\nOther <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_%28astronomy%29#Auroral_mechanism\">colors</a> are occasionally noticeable as atmospheric nitrogen also becomes affected.\n\nIn later sequences the Moon and rising stars are also visible.\n\nWith the <a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071203.html\">Sun</a> expected to become ever more active over the next few years, there may be many \n<a href=\"http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Humor/Cats/Curious.jpg\">opportunities to see</a> similarly  \n<a href=\"ap101124.html\">spectacular auroras</a> \npersonally, even from areas much \n<a href=\"ap031113.html\">closer to the equator</a>.",
