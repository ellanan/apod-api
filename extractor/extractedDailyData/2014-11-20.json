  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nObscuring the rich starfields of northern Cygnus, dark nebula LDN 988\nlies near the center of\n<a href=\"http://bf-astro.com/ldn988/ldn988.htm\">this cosmic skyscape</a>.\n\nComposed with telescope and camera, the scene is some 2 degrees\nacross.\n\nThat corresponds to 70 light-years at the estimated 2,000 light-year\ndistance of LDN 988. \n\nStars are forming within\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0881\">LDN 988</a>,\npart of a larger complex of\n<a href=\"ap101119.html\">dusty molecular clouds</a>\nalong the plane of our Milky Way galaxy sometimes\ncalled the Northern Coalsack.\n\nIn fact, nebulosities associated with young stars abound in the region,\nincluding variable star V1331 Cygni shown in the inset.\n\nAt the tip of a long dusty filament and partly surrounded by a curved\nreflection nebula,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610786\">V1331</a> is thought to\nbe a <a href=\"ap140503.html\">T Tauri star</a>, a sun-like\nstar still in the early stages of formation.",
