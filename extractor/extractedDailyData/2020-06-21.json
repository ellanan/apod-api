  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt may look like \n<a href=\"ap181224.html\">Earthrise</a>, but it's actually Venus-set.\n\nJust after sunrise two days ago, both the Moon and Venus also \n<a href=\"ap171203.html\">rose</a>. \n\nBut then the Moon overtook \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/\">Venus</a>.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/x4fvej/0/\">featured image sequence</a> \ncentered on the Moon, Venus is shown increasingly angularly \n<a href=\"ap190206.html\">close to the Moon</a>.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"ap181223.html\">famous Earthrise</a> image taken just over 50 years ago, \nthe Earth was captured rising over the edge of the Moon, as seen from the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo-8.html\">Apollo 8</a> \ncrew orbiting the Moon.\n\nThis similar Venus-set image was taken from Earth, of course, specifically \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia\">Estonia</a>. \n\nVenus shows only a thin crescent because last week it passed \n<a href=\"ap200608.html\">nearly in front of the Sun</a>, as seen from Earth. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">Moon</a> shows only a \n<a href=\"ap130414.html\">thin crescent</a> \nbecause it will soon be passing directly in front of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>, as seen from Earth.\n\nToday, in fact, two days after this image was taken, the Moon \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2020-june-21\">will create a solar eclipse</a>, with a thin swath across the Earth treated to an \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/annular-solar-eclipse.html\">annular solar eclipse</a>.",
