  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n15,000 years ago a star in the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Cygnus.html\">constellation of Cygnus</a> exploded --\nthe shockwave from this\n<a href=\"lib/supernova.html\">supernova</a> explosion is still expanding \ninto interstellar space!  The collision of this fast moving wall of gas with \na stationary cloud has heated it causing it to\nglow in visible as well as\n<a href=\"http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/astro2/astro2_science/cyglpne.html\">high energy radiation</a>, producing the nebula known as\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/CygnusLoop.txt\">the Cygnus Loop</a> (NGC 6960/95).\nThe nebula is located about 2500 light years away.\nThe colors used here indicate emission from different kinds of atoms\nexcited by the shock; oxygen-blue, sulfur-red, and hydrogen-green.\nThis picture was taken with\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/WFPC2/wfpc2_top.html\">the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2</a> on board the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/HSToverview.html\">Hubble Space Telescope.</a>",
