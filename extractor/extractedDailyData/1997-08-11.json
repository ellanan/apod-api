  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTonight the \n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/meteors/per97a.html\">Perseid \nMeteor Shower</a> reaches its maximum.  Grains of rocky ice will \nstreak across the sky as they evaporate during entry into \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html\">Earth's \natmosphere</a>.  These ice chips were shed from \n<a href=\"ap960219.html\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a>.  The \n<a href=\"ap960809.html\">Perseids</a> result from the annual \ncrossing of  the Earth through Comet Swift-Tuttle's orbit.  The \n<a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/perseids.html\">Perseids</a> \nare typically the most active \n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/index.html\">meteor shower</a> of the year. \nIn a clear dark sky, an observer might see a meteor a minute. \n<a href=\"http://aibn91.astro.uni-bonn.de/~skohle/atmosphere/perseid.html\">Pictured above</a> is a Perseid \n<a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/resources/ssguide/meteors.html\">meteor</a> \nfrom 1993.  The colors are representative but digitally enhanced.  As the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a> streaked across the night sky, \ndifferent excited atoms emitted different colors of light.  \nThe origin of the green tinge visible at the right is currently unknown, \nhowever, and might result from \n<a href=\"http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/8.html\">oxygen</a> \nin Earth's atmosphere.  <a href=\"http://stardate.utexas.edu/radio/calendars/StarDateDB.FM$RETRIEVE?value=08/11/1997&amp;field=ScriptAirDate&amp;html=Test+Request+Date\">Perseid meteors</a> can best be seen from a relaxing position, away from lights.",
