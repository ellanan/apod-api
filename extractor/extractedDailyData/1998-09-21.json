  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nNGC 281 is a busy workshop of star formation.  \nProminent features include a small \n<a href=\"ap980329.html\">open cluster</a> of stars, \na diffuse red-glowing \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/nebula.html\">emission nebula</a>, large lanes of obscuring \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">gas</a> and \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a>, and dense knots \nof dust and gas in which stars may still be forming.  \n\nThe open cluster of stars IC 1590 visible on the \nupper right has formed only in the last few million years.  \n\nThe brightest member of this cluster is actually a \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">multiple-star system</a> \nshining light that helps ionize the nebula's gas, \ncausing the red glow visible throughout.  \n\nThe lanes of <a href=\"ap980121.html\">dust</a> \non the lower right might be the home of future \n<a href=\"ap980412.html\">star formation</a>.  \n\nParticularly striking in the \n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/dfm/int012.html\">above photograph</a> are the dark \n<a href=\"ap961229.html\">Bok globules</a> \nvisible against the bright nebula.  \n\nStars are probably forming there right now.  The entire \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996AAS...188.4206G&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=34f6e1de7f29653\">NGC 281</a> system lies about 10 thousand light years distant.",
