  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBig, bright, and beautiful,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m083.html\">spiral galaxy M83</a>\nlies a mere twelve million light-years away, near the southeastern\ntip of the very long\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/hya/index.html\">constellation\nHydra</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M83-Starstream.html\">deep\nview of the gorgeous island universe</a>\nincludes observations from Hubble, along with ground based data from\nthe European Southern Observatory's very large telescope units,\nNational Astronomical Observatory of Japan's Subaru telescope, and\n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/about/abouttheaao.html\">Australian\nAstronomical Observatory</a> photographic data by D. Malin.\n\nAbout 40,000 light-years across, M83 is\npopularly known as the Southern Pinwheel for its pronounced spiral arms.\n\nBut the wealth of\n<a href=\"ap111111.html\">reddish star forming regions</a>\nfound near the edges of the arms' thick dust lanes,\nalso suggest another popular moniker for M83, the\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0825/\">Thousand-Ruby\nGalaxy</a>.\n\nArcing near the top of the novel cosmic portrait lies M83's northern\n<a href=\"ap100911.html\">stellar tidal stream</a>,\ndebris from the gravitational disruption of a smaller, merging\nsatellite galaxy.\n\nThe faint, elusive star stream was\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997PASA...14...52M\">found</a>\nin the mid 1990s by enhancing photographic plates.",
