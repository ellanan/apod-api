  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you can find planet Jupiter in tonight's sky, then\nyou can also find <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m044.html\">M44</a>,\npopularly known as the <a href=\"ap020925.html\">Beehive</a>\nstar cluster.\n\nIn fact, with a pair of binoculars most casual skygazers should\nfind it easy to zero in on this\n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/yoursky/\">celestial scene</a>.\n\nIt should be easy because after sunset Jupiter presently\n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/almanac/\">rules the night</a>\nas the brightest \"star\" overhead.\n\nNow near the\n<a href=\"http://www.scienceu.com/observatory/articles/retro/\nretro.html\">stationary part</a> of its wandering path through\nthe heavens, Jupiter will obligingly linger for a while at a spot\nonly a degree or so southeast of M44 in the relatively faint\n<a href=\"http://www.coldwater.k12.mi.us/lms/planetarium/myth/\ncancer.html\">constellation Cancer</a>.\n\nSeen here in a photograph from March 28, Jupiter (lower left)\nis strongly overexposed with the stars of M44 swarming above\nand to the right. \n\nThe picture approximately corresponds to\n<a href=\"http://www.visualdeepsky.org/netastrocatalog/\nmsg00123.html\">the view</a> when looking\nthrough a typical pair of binoculars.\n\n<a href=\"http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter.html\">Jupiter is</a>\nabout 30 light-minutes from our fair planet\nwhile M44, one of the closest star clusters, is around\n600 light-years away.",
