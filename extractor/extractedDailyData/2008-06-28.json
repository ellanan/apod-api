  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA weekend trip for astrophotography in central\n<a href=\"ap070205.html\">Australia</a> can\nresult in gorgeous skyscapes.\n\nIn this example recorded in March of 2006,\nthe center of our\n<a href=\"ap080503.html\">Milky Way</a> Galaxy rises over planet Earth's\nhorizon and the large sandstone formation called Uluru,\nalso known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru\">Ayers Rock</a>.\n\nAfter setting up two cameras to automatically image this\ncelestial scene in a series of exposures,\none through a wide-angle and the other through a telephoto lens,\nphotographer Joseph Brimacombe briefly turned his back\nto set up other equipment.\n\nTo his surprise, the ground around him suddenly lit up with\nthe brilliant flash of a\n<a href=\"http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireball/faqf.html\">fireball meteor</a>.\n\nTo his delight, both cameras captured the\n<a href=\"ap991202.html\">bright meteor</a>\nstreak.\n\nHighlighted in the telephoto view (inset), the fireball trail\nshines through cloud banks, just left of\n<a href=\"ap021030.html\">Ayers Rock</a>.",
