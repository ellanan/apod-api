  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs our Earth warming?\n\nCompared to the past 250 million years, the Earth is currently enduring a \n<a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/whats-hottest-earths-ever-been\">relative cold spell</a>, possibly about four degrees \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius\">Celsius</a> below average. \n\nOver the past 120 years, though, data indicate that the average global temperature of the Earth has increased by nearly one degree Celsius. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4975\">featured visualization</a> \nvideo depicts Earth's recent \n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/\">global warming</a> in graphic terms.\n\nThe depicted temperatures are taken from the \n<a href=\"https://www.giss.nasa.gov/\">Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a>' \n<a href=\"https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/\">Surface Temperature Analysis</a>.\n\nAlready noticeable by many, Earth's recent warming trend is causing \n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/\">sea levels to rise</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-precipitation\">precipitation patterns to change</a>, and \n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/\">pole ice to melt</a>. \n\nFew now disagree that recent global warming is occurring, and the \n<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) \nhas concluded that we humans have created a warming surge that is \n<a href=\"ap090421.html\">likely to continue</a>. \n\nA continuation could impact many local agricultures and even the global economy. \n\nAlthough there seems to be \n<a href=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ws8MosQggVDs2RuK8Rs2oH-1200-80.jpg\">no simple solutions</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering\">geoengineering</a> \nprojects that might help include \n<a href=\"ap220608.html\">artificial cloud creation</a> \nto reduce the amount of sunlight heating the Earth's surface.",
