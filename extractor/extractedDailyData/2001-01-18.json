  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe first and only total lunar eclipse for the\n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/OH/OH2001.html\">year 2001</a>\noccured on the evening of January 9/10 as the full Moon glided\nthrough Earth's shadow.\n\n<a href=\"ap970827.html\">Unlike</a> a\ntotal solar eclipse, a total lunar eclipse is\nvisible for anyone on the\n<a href=\"ap001127.html\">night side</a> of the planet during the event.\n\nThe night side for this geocentric\n<a href=\"ap010104.html\">celestial event</a>\nincluded Europe, Asia, and Africa where the\n<a href=\"http://www.lunaroutreach.org/\">Moon</a>\ncould be seen immersed in the umbra or dark portion of\nEarth's shadow for about 62 minutes as it passed\n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/extra/TLE010109/\nTLE2001Jan09-GMT.GIF\">just north</a> of the shadow's center.\n\nThis dramatic telescopic\n<a href=\"http://www.MrEclipse.com/MrEclipse.html\">photo of</a>\nthe eclipsed Moon\nwas made near Ankara, Turkey close to the time of midpoint of\nthe total phase.\n\nThe fact that the northern (top) portion of the eclipsed Moon\nis clearly brighter, even near mid-totality, demonstrates that\nEarth's shadow is not uniformly dark.",
