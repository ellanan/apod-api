  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSunrise at the South Pole is different.\n\nUsually a \n<a href=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZjBEW+qNL._AC_.jpg\">welcome sight</a>, it follows months of darkness -- and begins months of sunshine.\n\nAt <a href=\"https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/internal_resources/264/\">Earth's poles</a>, it can \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/analogs/nsf/sunrise_sunset\">take weeks</a> for the Sun to rise, \nin contrast with hours at any \nmid-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude\">latitude</a> location. \n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xi4MaJKd1gA\">Sunrise</a> \nat a pole is caused by the \n<a href=\"https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sfigs/Stilt.gif\">tilt of the Earth</a> as it orbits the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>, not by the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LUW51lvIFjg\">rotation of the Earth</a>. \n\nAlthough at a pole, an airless Earth would first see first Sun at an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">equinox</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-can-the-sun-be-seen-for-a-few-minutes-before-it-rises-above-the-horizon\">lensing effect</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> and the size of the \n<a href=\"ap040623.html\">solar disk</a> causes the \ntop of the Sun to appear about two-weeks early. \n\nPictured two weeks ago, the Sun peeks above the horizon of a \n<a href=\"ap111211.html\">vast</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/01/south-pole-coldest-winter-record/\">frozen</a> \n<a href=\"ap111211.html\">landscape</a> at Earth's South Pole. \n\nThe true <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole\">South Pole</a> is just a few meters to the left of the communications tower.\n\nThis polar sunrise capture was particularly photogenic as the Sun appeared capped by a \n<a href=\"ap140604.html\">green flash</a>.",
