  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nIn a cartwheel-shaped galaxy far, far away, huge\n<a href=\"ap960327.html\">comet-shaped</a> clouds of\ngas have been discovered racing through the nucleus at about\n700,000 miles per hour.\n\n<a href=\"ap950702.html\">The aptly named Cartwheel Galaxy</a>\nis actually about 500 million\nlight years distant, its suggestive shape created by\n<a href=\"ap951228.html\">a head-on collision\nwith a smaller galaxy</a>.\n\nResearchers studying\nthis disrupted galaxy using Hubble Space Telescope data\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/36.html\">recently discovered</a>\nimmense gaseous structures with heads\na few hundred light years across and tails thousands of light years long.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/36/C.html\">The fast moving dense gas clouds</a> appear as blue\ncomet-like shapes, mostly along the upper edge of the nucleus, in\nthis false color close-up of the Cartwheel's central region.\nTheir shape, like a boat's bow wave,\nwas probably created by the dense clouds moving through\nless dense material.",
