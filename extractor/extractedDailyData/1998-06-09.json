  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nEuropa's icy crust has many unusual features.  <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA01407\">Pictured above</a> is part of <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/europa.html\">Europa</a>'s southern hemisphere photographed by the \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/spacecraft.html\">Galileo spacecraft</a> currently orbiting \n<a href=\"http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/jupiter.htm\">Jupiter</a>.  Europa is one of the largest <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/discovery.html\">moons of Jupiter</a>, and is thought to have \n<a href=\"ap970409.html\">oceans of water</a> \nunderneath its ice-covered surface.  Among many \n<a href=\"ap980310.html\">cracks and ridges</a> \nappear dark cusp-shaped features running from the \nlower left toward the upper right.  \n\nThe origin of these features is not known for sure, \nbut their shape is thought to indicate that large portions of \n<a href=\"ap961120.html\">Europa's crust</a> move together, \nsimilar to <a href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/publications/text/dynamic.html\">tectonic motion</a> of our <a href=\"http://www.windows.umich.edu/earth/interior/earths_crust.html\">Earth's crust</a>.",
