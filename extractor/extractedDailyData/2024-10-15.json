  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow bright and strange will the tails of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS become?\n\n<a href=\"ap241007.html\">The comet</a> has brightened dramatically \nover the few weeks as it passed its closest to \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">the Sun</a> and, \njust three days ago, passed its closest to the Earth.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS)\">C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS)</a> became of the \n<a href=\"https://www.cometwatch.co.uk/brightest-comets-through-history/\">brightest comets</a> of the past century over the past few days, \nbut was unfortunately hard to see \nbecause it was so nearly superposed on the Sun. \n\nAs \n<a href=\"ap240925.html\">the comet</a> \nappears to move away from the Sun, it is becoming a \n<a href=\"https://www.seadna.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hilariously-Surprised-Dogs.jpg\">remarkable sight</a> -- but may soon begin to fade.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://hdr-astrophotography.com/comet-tails-simulations/\">featured animated video</a> shows how the comet's tails have developed, \nas viewed from Earth, and gives one prediction about how they might further develop.\n\nAs shown in the video, heavier parts of the  \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/Cometary+Dust+Tail\">dust tail</a> that trails the comet have begun to appear to \npoint in \n<a href=\"ap090225.html\">nearly the opposite direction</a> from lighter parts of the dust tail as well as the comet's   \n<a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a>, \nthe blue tail that is pushed directly out from the Sun by the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/\">solar wind</a>.",
