  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAre they gone?  They were not originally predicted to even be there.  \n\nThe mystery revolves around strange <a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/saturn/images/satring_image.html\">shadow-like spokes</a> that appeared on \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02274\">Saturn's large B-ring</a>, the large middle ring in the \n<a href=\"http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html\">complex system</a> of particles that orbits \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>.  \n\nThe spokes were discovered 23 years ago by the passing \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html\">Voyager spacecraft</a> and attributed to very \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1991Icar...91..297T\">fine dust</a> of unknown origin.  \n\nThe missing \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002DPS....34.3304M\">spokes</a> were noted in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05380\">above image</a>, taken last month, from the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now \n<a href=\"ap031210.html\">approaching</a> Saturn. \n\n<a href=\"ap971016.html\">Launched</a> in 1997, \nthe distance remaining between Cassini and Saturn is \nnow less than half that between the Earth and the Sun. \n\n<a href=\"http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/index.shtml\">Cassini</a> is expected to enter orbit around the \n<a href=\"saturn.html\">ringed Jovian giant</a> \nplanet in July and drop a probe onto \n<a href=\"ap000820.html\">Titan</a>, Saturn's largest moon.",
