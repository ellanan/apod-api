  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does this comet's nucleus have two components?\n\nThe <a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/07/17/the-dual-personality-of-comet-67pc-g/\">surprising discovery</a> that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet 67P/Churyumov�Gerasimenko</a> has a double nucleus came \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/07150633-quick-rosetta-update.html\">late last week</a> as \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">ESA</a>'s robotic interplanetary spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Europe_s_comet_chaser\">Rosetta</a> continued \n<a href=\"http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/\">its</a> approach toward the ancient comet's core.\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/07/17/the-dual-personality-of-comet-67pc-g/\">Speculative ideas</a> on how the double core was created include, currently, that \n<a href=\"ap140523.html\">Comet Churyumov�Gerasimenko</a> is actually the result of the merger of two comets, that \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/17jul_rosetta/\">the comet</a> is a \n<a href=\"ap140209.html\">loose pile of rubble</a> pulled apart by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification\">tidal forces</a>, \nthat ice evaporation on the comet has been asymmetric, \nor that the comet has undergone some sort of explosive event.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Call_for_Media_Rosetta_s_comet_rendezvous\">Pictured above</a>, the comet's unusual 5-km sized comet nucleus is seen rotating over the course of a few hours, with each frame taken 20-minutes apart.\n\nBetter images -- and hopefully more refined theories -- are expected as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)\">Rosetta</a> \nis on track to enter orbit around \n<a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/space/huge-surprise-for-rosetta-comet-scientists-twins-140717.htm\">Comet Churyumov�Gerasimenko</a>'s nucleus early next month, \nand by the end of the year, if possible, \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/The_Rosetta_lander\">land a probe</a> on it.",
