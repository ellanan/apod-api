  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo, the Moon is not a bow, and no, it did not shoot out a plane like an arrow.\n\nWhat is pictured is a chance superposition. \n\nThe plane's \n<a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/on-the-trail-of-contrails\">contrail</a> would normally appear white, \nbut the large volume of air toward the rising Sun preferentially knocked away blue light, not only making the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/\">sky blue</a>, \nbut giving the reflected trail a bright \n<a href=\"ap050711.html\">red hue</a>. \n\nFar in the distance, well behind \n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=airplane\">the plane</a>, the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/en/\">crescent Moon</a> also appears slightly reddened.\n\nCaptured early last month from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton\">Bolton</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom\">UK</a>, \nthe featured image was taken so soon after sunrise that the plane \nwas sunlit from below, as was its contrail. \n\nWithin minutes, unfortunately, the impromptu sky \n<a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/17grumpycat-1/17grumpycat-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg\">show ended</a>. \n\nThe plane moved out of sight. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">Moon</a> \nkept rising but became harder to see through a brightening sky. \n\nAnd the \n<a href=\"ap041013.html\">contrail</a> gradually dispersed.",
