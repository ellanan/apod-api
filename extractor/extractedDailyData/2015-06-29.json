  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow do sunspots evolve?\n\nLarge dark \n<a href=\"ap050216.html\">sunspot</a>s -- and the active regions that contain them -- may last for weeks, but all during that time they are constantly changing.\n\nSuch variations were particularly apparent a few weeks ago as the active region \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/todays-image/large-sunspot-group-ar-2339\">AR 2339</a> \ncame around the limb of the Sun and was tracked for the next 12 days by NASA's \n<a href=\"http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/\">Solar Dynamic Observatory</a>. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BejRxZAa66E\">featured time lapse video</a>, \nsome sunspots drift apart, while others merge.\n\nAll the while, the dark central \n<a href=\"http://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/help/what-are-sunspots\">umbral regions</a> \nshift internally and their surrounding lighter penumbras shimmer and wave. \n\nThe surrounding \n<a href=\"http://missionscience.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> \nappears to flicker as the carpet of yellow \n<a href=\"ap111106.html\">granules come and go</a> on the time scale of hours. \n\nIn general, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot\">sunspots</a> \nare relatively cool regions where the local \n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml\">magnetic field</a> \npokes through the Sun's surface and inhibits heating.\n\nOver the past week, an even more active region -- \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=23&amp;month=06&amp;year=2015\">AR 2371</a> -- has been crossing the Sun and releasing powerful flares that have resulted in \n<a href=\"http://spaceweathergallery.com/aurora_gallery.html\">impressive auroras</a> here on Earth.",
