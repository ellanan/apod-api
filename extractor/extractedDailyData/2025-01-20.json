  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy does Comet ATLAS have such colorful tails?\n\nLast week \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_(ATLAS)\">Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)</a> passed its closest to the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a> -- \nwell inside the orbit of \n<a href=\"ap190428.html\">Mercury</a> -- and brightened <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a47jhh/this_cat_is_happy_to_see_itself/#lightbox\">dramatically</a>. \n\nUnfortunately, the comet was then so angularly \nnear the Sun that it was very hard for \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">human</a>s to see.\n\nBut NASA's \n<a href=\"https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/about/about.html\">SOHO spacecraft</a> saw it.\n\nPictured is a SOHO \n(<a href=\"https://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/\">LASCO</a> C3) \nimage of \n<a href=\"ap250113.html\">Comet ATLAS</a> \nthat is a composite of several different color filters.\n\nOf the several tails visible, the central white tails are likely made of \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/*/Cometary+Dust+Tail\">dust</a> and just reflecting back sunlight.\n\nThe red, blue, and green tails are likely \n<a href=\"http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tails</a> with their colors dominated by \nlight emitted by specific gases that were \n<a href=\"ap151118.html\">ejected</a> \nfrom the comet and energized by the Sun. \n\nCurrently, \n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info\">Comet ATLAS</a> is showing \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=600057509389497\">long tails</a> in southern skies but \nfading as it moves out of the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/inner-solar-system/\">inner Solar System</a>.",
