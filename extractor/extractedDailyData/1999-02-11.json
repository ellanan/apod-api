  "explanation": "<b>  </b>  \nPlanets condense from disks.  Several new \n<a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \npictures of stars surrounded by disks were \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/05/index.html\">released</a> earlier this week. \n\nSince the glare of the central star usually \nmakes a surrounding disk hard to see, prior observations in \n<a href=\"ap960308.html\">radio</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html\">infrared</a> light were used to isolate \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/05/pr.html\">systems</a> where the disk was edge-on, \nblocking much of the central starlight.  \n\nOne such disk system, Haro 6-5B, is <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/05/extra-photos.html\">shown above</a> in false color. Here, the <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/05/content/9905a3.jpg\">central disk</a> confines the \nemitted light into an <a href=\"ap960127.html\">hourglass</a> shape.  \n\nComplex \n<a href=\"ap980104.html\">dust</a> clouds appear dark.  \nA powerful protruding \n<a href=\"ap971124.html\">jet</a> is shown in green.  \nThis budding planetary system measures 0.2 light-years across.  \nQuite possibly, our own <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html\">Solar System</a> looked like this about 5 billion years ago.",
