  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n<a href=\"http://www-news.uchicago.edu/docs/971222-schramm.html\">David N. Schramm</a> effectively combined the very big with the very small.  \nAmong his many scientific achievements, \n<a href=\"http://ars-www.uchicago.edu/physics/t_astro.html#Schramm\">Schramm</a> and collaborators successfully used \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_01.htm\">Big Bang cosmology</a> to \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1986awph%2Econf%2E%2E431S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">predict that only three families of elementary particles exist in the universe</a>, \nwhich was subsequently confirmed by \n<a href=\"http://www.slac.stanford.edu/\">high energy particle accelerators</a>.  \nSchramm and collaborators realized that  \ncurrent relative elemental abundance measurements,\nwhen combined with nuclear reaction rates,\nconstrain the amount of normal matter to be much\nless than that implied by the movements of stars and galaxies.\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1979ApJ%2E%2E%2E227%2E%2\nE697Y&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Therefore, most of the universe might be made of some sort\nof dark matter.</a>\nSchramm was a champion wrestler, a mountain climber, \nan inspiration to scientists and students, \nand was alone piloting a plane when it crashed last Friday.",
