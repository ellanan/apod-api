  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA crumbling comet will soon pass near the Earth.   \n\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/24mar_73p.htm\">Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> is brightening and may even be visible to the unaided \n<a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/anatomy.html\">eye</a> when the \n<a href=\"ap040724.html\">fragmented comet</a> zooms past Earth during the middle of next month.  \n\nStill, the small comet poses no \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/Academy/SPACE/SolarSystem/Meteors/ImpactHazard.html\">Earth hazard</a>, since it will pass the Earth at about 25 times the \ndistance of the Moon.  \n\nExactly how bright \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann\">Comet Schwassman-Wachmann 3</a> will get is unknown.  \n\nIt is even possible, althought unlikely, that debris from \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/073p.html\">the comet</a> \nwill have spread out enough to cause a notable \n<a href=\"ap031116.html\">meteor shower</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2006/phot-15-06.html\">Pictured above</a>,\nFragment B of \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2006/pr-15-06.html\">Comet Schwassman-Wachmann 3</a> was photographed two nights ago by a 8.2-meter \n<a href=\"ap990309.html\">Very Large Telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a>.\n\n<a href=\" http://www.space.com/spacewatch/060414_night_sky.html\">Visible</a> to the lower right of the large B fragment are many mini-comets \nthat have broken off and now orbit the Sun separately.  \n\nEach mini-comet itself sheds gas and dust and so appears to have its own hazy coma.  \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1704_1.asp\">The comet</a> will pass closest to the Sun on June 7.",
