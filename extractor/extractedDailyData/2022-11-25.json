  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBeautiful spiral galaxy NGC 6744 is nearly 175,000 light-years\nacross.\n\nThat's larger than <a href=\"ap080606.html\">the Milky Way</a>.\n\nIt lies some 30 million light-years distant in the southern\nconstellation Pavo, with its galactic disk tilted towards our line of sight.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2018/27/4167-Image.html\">This Hubble close-up</a>\nof the nearby island universe spans about\n24,000 light-years or so across NGC 6744's central region.\n\nThe Hubble view combines visible light and ultraviolet image data.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1118/\">The giant galaxy's</a>\nyellowish core is dominated by the visible light from old, cool stars.\n\nBeyond the core are star-forming regions and\nyoung star clusters scattered along the inner spiral arms.\n\nNGC 6744's young star clusters are bright at ultraviolet wavelengths,\nshown in blue and magenta hues.\n\n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/about/faq/#5\">Spiky stars</a>\nscattered around the frame are foreground stars and well\nwithin our own Milky Way.",
