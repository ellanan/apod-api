  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow can you wash your hair in space -- without \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/shuttlestation/station/microgex.html\">gravity</a>? \n\nLong a bother for space-faring astronauts, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/karen-l-nyberg/biography\">Karen Nyberg</a>, a \n<a href=\"https://prezi.com/6h-u6kfpmyf9/nasa-flight-engineer/\">flight engineer</a> on the \n<a href=\"ap151109.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) in 2013, gave a tutorial.\n\nKey components are a squirt package of water, no-rinse \n<a href=\"http://hairstory.com/stories/2017/3/24/the-history-of-shampoo\">shampoo</a>, and vigorous use of a \n<a href=\"https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/how-often-should-you-wash-bath-towels-t111625\">towel</a> and comb. \n\nEven so, the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIjNfZbUYu8\">featured video</a> shows that the whole process should take only a few minutes. \n\nResidual water will eventually \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGjwe-BCfms\">evaporate</a> from your \n<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/how-often-wash-hair\">hair</a>, \nbe captured by the space station's air conditioning system, and be purified into \n<a href=\"http://aboutcats.ucoz.net/kotenochek.jpg\">drinking water</a>.\n\nAfter returning from a total of 180 days in space, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Nyberg\">Nyberg</a> has worked for NASA in several capacities including as the Chief of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/robotics/home/index.html\">Robotics</a> branch.",
