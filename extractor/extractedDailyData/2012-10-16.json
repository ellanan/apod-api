  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening around that star?\n\nAn unusual spiral structure has been discovered around the Milky Way star \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1239/\">R Sculptoris</a>, a red giant star \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICtbIDdwZY\">located</a> \nabout 1,500 light years away toward the constellation of the Sculptor \n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor_%28constellation%29\">Sculptoris</a>).\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1239a/\">star</a> was observed with the new \n<a href=\"http://www.almaobservatory.org/\">Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</a> \n(ALMA), the most powerful telescopic array observing near \nmillimeter wavelengths, \nthat part of the spectrum situated well beyond red light but before microwaves and radio waves.\n\nData from <a href=\"ap111123.html\">ALMA</a> observations was used to \ncreate a 3D \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvJss-EI4KE\">visualization</a> \nof the gas and dust immediately surrounding the star.\n\nA digital slice through this data showed the unexpected \n<a href=\"ap120107.html\">spiral structure</a>.\n\nAlthough unusual, a similar spiral pattern was discovered in visible light recently around \n<a href=\"ap100914.html\">LL Pegasi</a>.\n\nUpon analyzing the data, a \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1210.3030M\">hypothesis was drawn</a> \nthat the red giant star in R Sculptoris might be puffing gas toward an unseen \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary companion star</a>.\n\nThe dynamics of \n<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/tag/r-sculptoris/\">this system</a> \nmight be particularly insightful because it may be giving clues as to how \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_stars\">giant stars</a> \nevolve toward the end of their lives -- and so release some constituent \nelements back to the \n<a href=\"ap100829.html\">interstellar medium</a> \nso that new stars may form.",
