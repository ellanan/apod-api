  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat created the strange spiral structure on the upper left?  \n\nNo one is sure, although it is likely related to a star in a \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star</a> system entering the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\">planetary nebula</a> phase, when its outer atmosphere is ejected.\n \nThe <a href=\"ap210124.html\">huge spiral</a> spans about a third of a \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light year</a> across and, winding four or five \n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1710a/\">complete turns</a>, has a regularity that is without precedent.  \n\nGiven the expansion rate of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral\">spiral</a> gas, \na new layer must appear about every 800 years, \na close match to the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/videos/potw1710a/\">star system</a> that created it is most commonly known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_Pegasi\">LL Pegasi</a>, \nbut also AFGL 3068 and IRAS 23166+1655.  \n\nThe featured image was taken in near-<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> light by the \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.\n\nWhy the <a href=\"http://flyingpudding.com/projects/florets/applet/\">spiral glows</a> is \n<a href=\"https://www.intermountainpet.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg?width=900&amp;name=Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg\">itself a mystery</a>, with a leading hypothesis being \nillumination by light reflected from nearby stars.",
