  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/129279/looking-lunar-letters/\">A more\ncreative</a> search by a group of amateur astronomers\nin the Ehime Prefecture of Shikoku Island, Japan has found\n<a href=\"image/1811/LOVE2_1080.jpg\">lunar L-O-V-E</a>.\n\nTheir secret was an examination of this sharp image of the\nFirst Quarter Moon.\n\n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">To discover it for yourself</a>\nyou'll need to look closely\nat details of the shadow and light along the terminator,\nthe line between lunar night and day.\n\nCreated by the contrast of shadowed crater floors\nwith sunlit walls and ridges, the letter V is not too hard\nto find near the center of the image.\n\nLetters L and E are a bit more challenging though, but\ncan be teased out of shadow and light along the terminator at the bottom.\n\nOf course, on the <a href=\"ap010428.html\">cratered surface</a>\nof the Moon the O is easy ... .\n\nMoonwatchers on <a href=\"ap060909.html\">planet Earth</a> should understand\nthat like the famous\n<a href=\"ap180301.html\">lunar X</a>, also seen here,\nthese lunar letters are transient and only appear\nalong the terminator in the hours around the Moon's first quarter phase.\n\nSo your next chance for lunar L-O-V-E is the first quarter Moon on\nNovember 15.",
