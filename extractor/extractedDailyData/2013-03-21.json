  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nMoving left to right near the center of this beautifully\ndetailed color composite, the thin, bright, braided filaments\nare actually long ripples in a sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge on.\n\nThe interstellar shock wave\nplows through space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2003/16/supplemental.html\">Cataloged\nas NGC 2736</a>, its elongated appearance\nsuggests its popular name,\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/\npencil_nebula.html\">the Pencil Nebula</a>.\n\nThe Pencil Nebula is about 5 light-years long and 800 light-years away,\nbut represents only a small part of the\n<a href=\"http://violet.pha.jhu.edu/~wpb/hstvela/hstvela.html\">Vela\nsupernova remnant</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap080306.html\">Vela remnant itself</a>\nis around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">debris\ncloud of a star</a> that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago.\n\nInitially, the shock wave was moving at millions of kilometers\nper hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up\nsurrounding interstellar material.\n\nIn the narrowband, wide field image, red and blue-green colors track the\ncharacteristic glow of\n<a href=\"ap051223.html\">ionized hydrogen</a> and\n<a href=\"ap130307.html\">oxygen atoms</a>.",
