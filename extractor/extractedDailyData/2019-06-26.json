  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes it's night on the ground but day in the air.\n\nAs the Earth rotates to eclipse the Sun,\n<a href=\"ap170601.html\">sunset</a> rises up from the ground.\n\nTherefore, at sunset on the ground, sunlight still shines on \n<a href=\"https://pmm.nasa.gov/education/videos/nasa-our-world-what-cloud\">clouds</a> above.  \n\nUnder usual circumstances, a\n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">pretty sunset</a>\nmight be visible, but unusual\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud\">noctilucent cloud</a>s float so high up they\ncan be seen well after dark.  \n\nNormally too dim to be seen,\n<a href=\"ap120822.html\">they</a> may become \nvisible just after sunset during the summer when illuminated by sunlight from below.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/nlc2.htm\">Noctilucent clouds</a> \nare the highest clouds known and thought to be part of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_mesospheric_clouds\">polar mesospheric clouds</a>.  \n\nFeatured here as they appeared two weeks ago,\na network of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pslcQXWQz3k\">noctilucent clouds</a> was captured not only in the distant sky but in reflection from a small lake just north of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3ah7Rgcak\">Zwolle</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands\">Netherlands</a>, with trees in stark \n<a href=\"ap160501.html\">silhouette</a> across the horizon. \n\n\nUnusually bright \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/8366/noctilucent-clouds\">noctilucent clouds</a> continue to appear over much of northern \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\">Europe</a>. \n\nMuch about\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/19feb_nlc/\">noctilucent clouds</a> has been discovered only over the past decade, \nwhile how they form and evolve remains a\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997JGR...102.2001C\">topic of active research</a>.",
