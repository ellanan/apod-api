  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would the sky look like a giant fan?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow1.htm\">Airglow</a>.\n\nThe featured intermittent \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te_H0Uo6YEA\">green glow</a> \nappeared to rise from a lake through the arch of our \n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, \nas captured last summer next to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8eQKvlSb9Q\">Bryce Canyon</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah\">Utah</a>, USA. \n\nThe unusual \n<a href=\"\">pattern was created by</a> atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_484.html\">gravity waves</a>, ripples of alternating air pressure that can grow with height as the air thins, \nin this case about \n<a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=79817\">90 kilometers up</a>. \n\nUnlike <a href=\"ap140714.html\">auroras</a> powered by collisions with \nenergetic charged particles and seen at high latitudes, airglow is due to \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow2.htm\">chemiluminescence</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap130619.html\">production of light</a> in a chemical reaction. \n\nMore typically seen near the horizon, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow\">airglow</a> keeps the night sky from ever being completely dark.",
