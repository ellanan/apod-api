  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNGC 6888, also known as\n<a href=\"ap030415.html\">the Crescent Nebula</a>, is\na cosmic bubble of interstellar gas about 25 light-years across.\n\nCreated <a href=\"http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/Astronomy/SteWin.html\">by\nwinds</a> from the bright, massive star seen near the center\nof this composite image, the\nshocked filaments of gas glowing at optical\nwavelengths are represented in green and yellowish hues.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/ngc6888/\">X-ray\nimage data</a> from a portion of the nebula viewed by\nthe Chandra Observatory is overlaid in blue.\n\nSuch isolated\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310311\">stellar wind\nbubbles</a> are not usually seen to\nproduce\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory1_xray.html\">energetic x-rays</a>, which require\nheating gas to a million degrees celsius.\n\nStill, NGC 6888 seems to have accomplished this\nas slow moving winds from the central star's initial transition\nto a <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/\nredsup.html\">red supergiant</a>\nwere overtaken and rammed by faster\nwinds driven by the intense radiation from the star's\nexposed inner layers.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/askexpert_question.cfm?\narticleID=000607EA-5B27-1E56-A98A809EC5880105\">Burning fuel</a>\nat a prodigious rate and near the end\nof its <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm_lc/edu/lessons/\nbackground-lifecycles.html\">stellar life</a>, NGC 6888's central star\nshould ultimately go out with a bang, creating a supernova\nexplosion in 100,000 years or so.\n\nNGC 6888 is about 5,000 light-years close, toward the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/cyg.html\">Cygnus</a>.",
