  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes the Sun follow the same path every day?\n\n<a href=\"https://sadanduseless.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/funny-suprised-cat2.jpg\">No</a>. \n\nThe Sun's path changes during the year, tracing a longer route during the summer than the winter.\n\n<a href=\"https://greenflash.photo/portfolio/la-traiettoria-del-sole-nei-giorno-dellequinozio-e-del-solstizio/\">Pictured here</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap101221.html\">Sun's arc</a> was captured from noon to sunset on three days,  \nfrom highest in the sky to lowest: \n<a href=\"ap210620.html\">summer solstice</a>, \n<a href=\"ap210922.html\">equinox</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap151231.html\">winter solstice</a>. \n\nThe images were taken near \n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/eSwDyTAmV6FZem2w7\">Gatto Corvino</a> Village in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily\">Sicily</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a> in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe path and time the \n<a href=\"ap220321.html\">Sun spends in the sky</a> \nis more important in \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/\">determining the season</a> than \nhow close the Earth is to the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>. \n\nIn fact, the \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question53.html\">Earth is closest</a> to the Sun in January, during northern winter. \n\nToday is a \n<a href=\"ap170621.html\">solstice</a>, so \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice\">today</a> \nthe Sun is taking its longest path of the year across the sky in Earth's  \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere\">northern hemisphere</a>, \nbut the shortest path in the \n<a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-of-the-southern-hemisphere-1435565\">southern hemisphere</a>.",
