  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nTypically, the International Space Station is visible only at night. \n\nSlowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) can be seen as a \n<a href=\"ap200528.html\">bright spot</a> about once a month from many locations. \n\n<a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/faq.cfm\">The ISS</a> \nis then visible only just after sunset or just \nbefore sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the \n<a href=\"ap161105.html\">ISS</a> enters the \n<a href=\"ap080820.html\">Earth's shadow</a>, it will drop \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FindTheSniper/comments/1chffk6/find_the_cat/#lightbox\">out of sight</a>.\n\nThe only occasion when the \n<a href=\"ap160513.html\">ISS is visible during the day</a> is when it \n<a href=\"ap190715.html\">passes right in front of the Sun</a>.\n\nThen, it passes so quickly that only cameras \ntaking short exposures can visually freeze the \n<a href=\"ap150912.html\">ISS's silhouette</a> onto the background \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/\">Sun</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DIrW8Vuoh-f/\">featured picture</a> \ndid exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Feliu_de_Buixalleu\">Sant Feliu de Buixalleu</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\">Spain</a>\nwith perfect timing. \n\n<a href=\"image/2505/IssTransit_Sanz.mp4\">This image series</a> \nwas later combined with a separate image highlighting \nthe texture of the active Sun which included several \n<a href=\"ap180618.html\">Sun's prominences</a> around the edge.",
