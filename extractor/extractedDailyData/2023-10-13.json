  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nGorgeous spiral galaxy Messier 33 seems to have more than its fair share of\nglowing hydrogen gas.\n\nA prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also\nknown as the <a href=\"ap211106.html\">Triangulum Galaxy</a> and\nlies a mere 3 million light-years away. \n\nThe galaxy's central 30,000 light-years or so are shown in this\n<a href=\"https://www.wittich.com/?p=9882\">sharp galaxy portrait</a>.\n\nThe portrait features M33's\nreddish ionized hydrogen clouds or\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region\">HII regions</a>.\n\nSprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core,\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2003/30/1422-Image.html\">M33's giant HII regions</a>\nare some of the largest known stellar nurseries,\nsites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars.\n\nIntense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes\nthe surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the\ncharacteristic red glow.\n\nIn this image, broadband data were combined\nwith narrowband data recorded through a hydrogen-alpha filter.\n\nThat filter transmits the light of the strongest visible hydrogen\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--how-absorption-and-emission-spectra-work\">emission line</a>.",
