  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhen two planets pass on the night sky, they can usually be seen near each other for a week or more.\n\nIn the case of this planetary \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)\">conjunction</a>, Venus and Mars passed within 4 degrees of each other earlier \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2716/whats-up-march-2022/\">this month</a>.\n\nThe featured image was taken a few days prior, when \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/\">Venus</a> was slowing rising in the pre-dawn sky, night by night, while \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> was slowly setting.\n\nThe image, a four-part mosaic, was captured in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil\">Brazil</a> from the small town \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iOvEvl_8q0s\">Teresópolis</a>.\n\nBesides <a href=\"ap150226.html\">Venus and Mars</a>, \nthe morning sky now also \n<a href=\"ap151108.html\">includes</a> the more distant planet \n<a href=\"ap200419.html\">Saturn</a>. \n\nOf course, these \n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/article.php?term=conjunction\">conjunctions</a> are only angular -- \nVenus, Mars, and Saturn continue to \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">orbit the Sun</a> in very different parts of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">our Solar System</a>. \n\nNext week, the angle between \n<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20220404_20_100\">Saturn and Mars</a> will drop to <a href=\"https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/01/00/01/360_F_201000123_YnljkDm0s79myrqpKBiljH5YaRF8v7GJ.jpg\">below a quarter of a degree</a>.",
