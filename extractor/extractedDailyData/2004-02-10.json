  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat are those unusual spherules on Mars?  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/\">Mars Opportunity rover</a> \nhas now photographed several unusual nodules on Mars that\nhave a nearly spherical shape.  \n\nMany times <a href=\"ap040206.html\">these spherules</a> are embedded in \n<a href=\" ap040127.html\">larger rock outcroppings</a> but appear grayer.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/feb-09-2004/captions/image-3.html\">Pictured</a> in the inset is one such spherule embedded in a rock dubbed Stone Mountain, visible to the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html\">Opportunity rover</a> now rolling \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/feb-09-2004/captions/image-8.html\">inside a small crater</a> on  \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap040126.html\">Meridiani Planum</a>.\n\nOpportunity was directed to go right up to \nStone Mountain to get a better look.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/feb-09-2004/captions/image-11.html\">inset picture</a> spans only 3 centimeters across, revealing the rock to be named more for shape than actual size.  \n\nScientists are currently debating the origin of the \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mer2004/rover-images/feb-09-2004/captions/image-2.html\">spherules</a>.  \n\nOne leading hypothesis holds that the \n<a href=\"ap030112.html\">beads</a> were \nonce-molten rock that froze in mid-air after an \nimpact or a volcanic eruption.  \n\nAnother hypothesis holds that the spherules are \n<a href=\"http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/geodes.htm\">concretions</a>, hard rock that slowly accumulates around a central core.  \n\nOpportunity will work to solve this mystery and others over the next few days.",
