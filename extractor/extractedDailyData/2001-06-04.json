  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat did the Sun look like before there were planets?  \n\nA prototype laboratory for the formation of \nlow mass stars like our Sun is the \n<a href=\"http://etacha.as.arizona.edu/~eem/ttau/\">T Tauri system</a>, one of the \nbrighter star systems toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/astro/asp/constellation.faq.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/tau.html\">Taurus</a>.  \n\nIn \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/gallery/stars_ttauri.html\">young systems</a>, gravity causes a \n<a href=\"ap990511.html\">gas cloud</a> to condense.  \n\nThe situation then usually becomes quite complex, \nas some of the infalling gas is heated so much by \ncollisions that it is immediately expelled as an \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">outgoing wind</a>.  \n\nComplex geometries including \n<a href=\"ap991129.html\">jets</a> and \n<a href=\"ap991219.html\">disks</a> form as the \ninfalling and outflowing gas collide \nand interact with a changing \n<a href=\"ap001203.html\">magnetic field</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/Astros/Imageofweek/ciw290500.html\">Pictured above</a> is a false-color image of the \n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/Astros/Imageofweek/ciw-image/290500-2.gif\">T Tauri system</a> itself, which turns out to be a\n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary</a>.  \n\nIn a \n<a href=\"http://www.go.ednet.ns.ca/~larry/stars/prtostar.html\">few million years</a>, the central condensate \nwill likely become hot enough to ignite \n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/\">nuclear fusion</a>, by which time much of \nthe surrounding circumstellar material will \neither have fallen in or have been driven off by the \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html\">stellar wind</a>.  \n\nAt that time, a \n<a href=\"ap971008.html\">new star</a> will shine.",
