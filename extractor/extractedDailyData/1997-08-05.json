  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy do many galaxies appear as \n<a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">spirals</a>?  A striking example is \n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/m101b.html\">M101, shown above</a>, \nwhose relatively close distance of about 22 million light years \nallow it to be studied in some detail.  <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E481%2E%2E169W&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Recent evidence</a> indicates that a close gravitational interaction \nwith a neighboring galaxy created <a href=\"http://lsnt7.lightspeed.net/~astronomy/galaxy.notes/galaxy.notes.html#A1.1.5.1\">waves of high mass</a> and condensed gas which continue to circle the \n<a href=\"ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">galaxy</a>.  These waves compress existing gas and cause \n<a href=\"ap970119.html\">star formation</a>.  \nOne result is that \n<a href=\"ap970608.html\">M101</a>, also called the Pinwheel Galaxy, \nhas several extremely bright \nstar-forming regions (called HII regions) \nspread across its spiral arms.  \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m101.html\">M101</a> \nis so large that its immense gravity distorts smaller nearby galaxies.",
