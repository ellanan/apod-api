  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMeteors streaked through the sky above many of Earth's cities last week, but nobody was hurt, and no damage has been reported.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_shower\">assault from space</a> appeared to originate from someplace in the\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/const.html\">constellation</a> of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)\">Perseus</a>, and included millions of\n<a href=\"ap011117.html\">small projectiles</a> hurtling\ntoward Earth at over 200,000 kilometers per hour.  \n\nPictured above, people gathered at\n<a href=\"http://www.astrolab-parc-national-mont-megantic.org/\">ASTROLab du Mont-Megantic</a> in southern\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec\">Quebec</a>,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a> gazed helplessly toward the sky during a similar event last year as they themselves were unable to stop the meteor\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-EiUSUnhw\">onslaughts</a>.\n\nFortunately, <a href=\"http://www.spaceguarduk.com/\">Earth's defense</a>, consisting of a planet-wide\n<a href=\"http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm\">blanket of air</a> over 100-kilometers thick, obliterated the\n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/meteors/gallery_12aug10.htm\">attacking projectiles</a> by using friction generated by their own speed to heat them into disintegration.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap080701.html\">large triangle</a> in the foreground,\nalthough impressive in appearance, was not part of the Earth's meteor defense system.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap080103.html\">space attack</a>\nwas expected as part of the annual Perseids\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18013\">meteor shower</a> as the Earth passed through sand-sized debris left over from the sun-orbiting\n<a href=\"ap960219.html\">Comet Swift-Tuttle</a>.",
