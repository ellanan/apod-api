  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nPeriodic comet\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/\n073p.html\">73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> has fallen apart before.\n\nA <a href=\"ap050915.html\">cosmic souffle</a>\nof ice and dust left over from the early\nsolar system, this comet was\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/\n24mar_73p.htm?list237669\">seen to split</a> into several large pieces\nduring the close-in part of its orbit in 1995. \n\nHowever, <a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/\narticle_1704_1.asp\">this time the comet</a>\nseems to be rapidly disintegrating\nwith over three dozen fragments, named alphabetically, now\nstretching several degrees across the sky.\n\n<a href=\"http://nineplanets.org/comets.html\">Since comets</a>\nare relatively fragile, stresses from heat and gravity\nand outgassing, for example, could be responsible for their\ntendency <a href=\"ap000811.html\">to breakup</a> in such a\nspectacular fashion.\n\nOn April 18th, the Hubble Space Telescope\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2006/18/\">recorded this\nsharp view</a> of prolific <a href=\"ap060426.html\">Fragment B</a>,\nitself trailing dozens of\nsmaller pieces, each with its own cometary coma and tail.\n\nThe picture spans over 3,000 kilometers at the comet's April\n18 distance of 32 million kilometers from planet Earth.\n\nWith its brightest fragment presently too faint to be\nseen with the naked eye, comet\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73P/\nSchwassmann-Wachmann\">Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> will\n<a href=\"http://www.shadowandsubstance.com/\">pass closest to Earth</a>\non May 13 at a distance of about 11 million kilometers.",
