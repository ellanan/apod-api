  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nJupiter looks a bit different in ultraviolet light. \n\nTo better interpret  \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/\">Jupiter</a>'s cloud motions and to help NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/\">Juno</a> spacecraft understand the \nplanetary context of the small fields that it sees, the \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> was being directed to \n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=14661\">regularly image</a> the entire Jovian giant.\n\nThe colors of Jupiter \n<a href=\"https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=14661\">being monitored</a> go beyond the normal human visual range to include both \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet</a> and \n(not pictured) <a href=\"ap180221.html\">infrared</a> light. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/39448899094/in/photostream/\">Featured</a> from 2017, Jupiter appears different \nin near ultraviolet light, partly because the amount of sunlight \nreflected back is distinct, giving differing cloud <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Awww/comments/1ipizhk/stacked_cats_to_save_space/#lightbox\">heights</a> and latitudes \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/109/jupiter-in-blue-ultraviolet-and-near-infrared/\">discrepant brightnesses</a>.\n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/hubble-provides-unique-ultraviolet-view-of-jupiter/\">near UV, Jupiter</a>'s poles appear relatively dark, as does its \n<a href=\"ap180425.html\">Great Red Spot</a> and a smaller (optically) \n<a href=\"ap170228.html\">white oval</a> to the right. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://astronomynow.com/2017/06/26/jupiters-string-of-pearls/\">String of Pearl</a> storms farther to the right, however, are brightest in near ultraviolet, and so here appear (false-color) pink. \n\nJupiter's largest moon \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-moons/ganymede/\">Ganymede</a> appears on the upper left.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/nasas-juno-mission-expands-into-the-future/\">Juno</a> continues on a looping 33-day orbit around Jupiter, \nwhile Earth-orbiting Hubble is aging and now relies on a \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/design/hubble-one-gyro-mode/\">single stabilizing gyroscope</a>.",
