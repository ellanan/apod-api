  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOn October 10, a new telescope reflected the light\nof the setting Sun.\n\nWith dark horizon above and sunset colors below,\nits segmented mirror inverts an image of the\nbeautiful evening sky in this snapshot\nfrom the Roque del Los Muchachos Observatory on the\nCanary Island of La Palma.\n\nThe mirror segments cover a 23 meter diameter and are mounted\nin the open structure of the\n<a href=\"http://www.lst1.iac.es/\">Large Scale Telescope 1</a>,\ninaugurated as the first component of the\n<a href=\"https://www.cta-observatory.org/\">Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA).</a>\n\nMost ground-based telescopes\nare hindered by the atmosphere that blurs, scatters, and absorbs light.\n\nBut cherenkov telescopes are designed to detect very high energy\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays\">gamma rays</a>\nand actually require the atmosphere to operate.\n\nAs the gamma rays impact the upper atmosphere they produce\n<a href=\"ap160820.html\">air showers</a> of high-energy particles.\n\nA large, fast camera at the common focus images the brief flashes of\noptical light, called\n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/\ngamma_detectors2.html\">Cherenkov light</a>,\ncreated by the air shower particles.\n\nThe flashes reveal the incoming gamma ray timing, direction, and energy.\n\nUltimately more than 100 Cherenkov telescopes are planned for the CTA\nat locations in both northern and southern hemispheres\n<a href=\"ap120202.html\">on planet Earth</a>.",
