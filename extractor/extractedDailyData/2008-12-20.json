  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nTomorrow's solstice marks the southernmost point of the Sun's\nannual motion through planet Earth's sky and the\n<a href=\"http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/\nSseason.htm\">astronomical</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/\nbadseasons.html\">beginning</a> of winter in the north.\n\nIn celebration of the northern winter solstice and the\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy2009.ie\">International Year of\nAstronomy 2009</a>, you can watch a live\nwebcast of the\n<a href=\"http://www.newgrange.com/winter_solstice.htm\">the\nsolstice sunrise</a> from the\n<a href=\"http://www.newgrange.com/\">megalithic tomb of Newgrange</a>,\nin County Meath, Ireland.\n\nNewgrange dates to 5,000 years ago, much older than\n<a href=\"ap060621.html\">Stonehenge</a>,\nbut also with accurate alignments to the solstice Sun.\n\nIn this view from within the burial mound's inner\nchamber, the first rays of the solstice sunrise\n<a href=\"http://www.knowth.eu/winter-solstice.htm\">are passing\nthrough</a> a box constructed above the entrance and\nshine down an 18 meter long tunnel\nto illuminate the floor at the foot of a decorated stone.\n\nThe actual stone itself would have been directly illuminated\nby <a href=\"ap071222.html\">the solstice Sun</a> 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe long time exposure also captures the ghostly figure of a more\nmodern astronomer in motion.\n\nTo watch the live webcast follow the indicated link below.\n\nThe webcast is planned to go live at 0830 coordinated Universal Time\n(<a href=\"http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/world_tzones.php\">for\nexample</a>, at 3:30am Eastern Time in the US) tomorrow, Sunday, the 21st.",
