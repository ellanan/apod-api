  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did orange soil appear on the Moon?  \n\nThis \n<a href=\" http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/a17.sta4.html\">mystery began</a> when astronaut \n<a href=\" http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.crew.html#jackbio\">Harrison Schmidt</a> noticed the off-color patch near \n<a href=\"ap001209.html\">Apollo 17</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/pub/expmoon/Apollo17/A17_lsite.html\">Taurus-Littrow</a> landing site in 1972.  \n\nSchmidt and fellow astronaut \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.crew.html#genebio\">Eugene Cernan</a> scooped up some of the \n<a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/a17.sta4.html\">unusual orange soil</a> for detailed inspection back on Earth.  \n\n<a href=\"http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS17/10076006.htm\">Pictured above</a> is a return sample shown greatly magnified, \nwith its discovery location shown in the \n<a href=\"http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS17/10075960.htm\">inset</a>.  \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo17/A17_sampact.html\">orange soil</a> contains particles less than \n0.1 millimeter across, some of the smallest \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/galleries/attm/wl.so.1.html\">particles yet found on the Moon</a>.  \n\nLunar geologists now think that the \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/cap/moon/moondust.htm\">orange soil</a> was created during an ancient \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/cap/volc/fountain.htm\">fire-fountain</a>. \n\nDetailed chemical and dating \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996LPI....27..303D\">analyses indicate</a> that during an explosive volcanic eruption 3.64 billion years ago, \n<a href=\"ap000322.html\">small drops</a> \nof molten rock cooled rapidly into the \nnearly spherical colored grains.  \n\nThe origin of some of the unusual \n<a href=\"http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/curator/lunar/lunar.htm\">elements found in the soil</a>,\nhowever, remains unknown.",
