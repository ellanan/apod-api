  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAuroras usually occur high above the clouds. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/auror3.htm\">auroral glow</a> is created when fast-moving particles ejected from the Sun impact the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere/\">Earth's magnetosphere</a>, from which charged particles spiral along the \n<a href=\" http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/Earths-magneticfieldlines-dipole.html\">Earth's magnetic field</a> to strike atoms and molecules high in the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>. \n\nAn <a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a> atom, for example, \nwill glow in the green light commonly emitted by an \n<a href=\"ap141103.html\">aurora</a> after being energized by such a collision. \n\nThe lowest part of an \n<a href=\"ap130609.html\">aurora</a> will typically occur about 100 kilometers up, while most clouds exist only below about 10 kilometers. \n\nThe relative heights of clouds and \n<a href=\"http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast\">auroras</a> are shown clearly in the \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NikonItalia/photos/a.380376239661.158168.147466084661/10153716437154662/\">featured picture</a> in 2015 from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_Om267wp-h4\">Dyrholaey</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland\">Iceland</a>.\n\nThere, a determined astrophotographer withstood \n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/puppytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dogs_In_Wind_9.jpg?resize=619%2C411&amp;ssl=1\">high winds</a> and initially overcast skies in an attempt to capture aurora over a \n<a href=\"image/1511/DSC_6447.jpg\">picturesque lighthouse</a>, \nonly to take, by chance, the featured picture including elongated \n<a href=\"ap090203.html\">lenticular clouds</a>, \n<a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/05/06/other-plans/\">along the way</a>.",
