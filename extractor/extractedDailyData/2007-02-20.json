  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat created these white ridges on Mars? \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09189\">images</a> \nshowing the white ridges, including some of the highest resolution images \never taken from Martian orbit, were recorded last year by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (MRO).\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-017\">current \nleading hypothesis</a> is that the white ridges formed as water flowed through \nunderground cracks and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleaching\">bleached</a> and hardened the edges of surrounding rocks.  \n\nOver millions of years, surface winds eroded the darker rock leaving the raised white ridges.   \n\nSuch water-created light-colored markings are well known here on \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">Earth</a>. \n\nThe hypothesis is particularly interesting as underground water \ncould have helped to support \n<a href=\"http://www.microbeworld.org/microbes/\">microbial life</a> on the red world.\n\nThe above image resolves surface features as small as one meter across in \n<a href=\"ap030218.html\">Candor Chasma</a> region of huge \n<a href=\"ap060730.html\">Valles Marineris</a> on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a>.",
