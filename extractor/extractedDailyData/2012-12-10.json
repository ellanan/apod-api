  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever experienced a total eclipse of the Sun? \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/53641212\">above time-lapse movie</a> depicts such an eclipse in dramatic detail as \n<a href=\"ap121116.html\">visible</a> \n<a href=\"ap121117.html\">from</a> \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia\">Australia</a> last month.\n\nAs the video begins, a slight dimming of the Sun and the surrounding Earth is barely perceptible.\n\nSuddenly, as the Moon moves to \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=30001\">cover</a> \nnearly the entire Sun, darkness sweeps in from the left -- the fully blocked part of the Sun. \n\nAt totality, only the bright \n<a href=\"ap100316.html\">solar corona</a> extends past the edges of the Moon, and darkness surrounds you.\n\nDistant horizons are still bright, though, as they are not in the darkest part of the shadow. \n\nAt mid-totality the darkness dips to the horizon below the eclipsed Sun, created by the \n<a href=\"ap100804.html\">shadow cone</a> -- a corridor of shadow that traces back to the Moon.\n\nAs the total solar eclipse ends -- usually after a few minutes -- \nthe process reverses and \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">Moon's shadow</a> moves off to the other side.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_solar_eclipse\">Solar eclipses</a> \ncan frequently be \n<a href=\"ap050407.html\">experienced</a> at \n<a href=\"http://web.williams.edu/astronomy/eclipse/eclipse2012/2012total/index.html\">gatherings organized</a> along the \nnarrow eclipse path as well as specialized cruises and plane flights.",
