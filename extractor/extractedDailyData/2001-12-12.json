  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThere were two peaks to this year's \n<a href=\"http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/leonids.html\">Leonid Meteor Shower</a>.  \n\nThe first peak was best seen during the early morning hours of November 18 in \n<a href=\"http://www.geobop.com/World/NA/Facts/\">North America</a>, \nwhile the second peak, almost twice the intensity of the first, \noccurred eight hours later and was best seen from \n<a href=\"http://www.askasia.org/image/maps/asia.htm\">Asia</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.kao.re.kr/kao-english/new/SOAO1.htm\">Pictured above</a> is an image of \n<a href=\"http://www.kao.re.kr/kao-english/otherkao/sobaekright_e.html\">SoBaekSan National Observatory</a> in \n<a href=\" http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ks.html\">Korea</a> during the \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/leonid_results_011127-2.html\">second Leonid peak</a>, starting at 3:50 am local time.  \n\nVisible in the background are \n<a href=\"ap011205.html\">numerous Leonid meteors</a> \nbright enough to be seen over background light even \nduring the 40-minute exposure.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.kao.re.kr/kao-english/new/Leonid2001.htm\">Local observers</a> reported an average of over one \n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/news/news.html\">meteor</a> \nper second during this outburst.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dust2002.html\">Next year's Leonid Meteor Shower</a> might be even more \nintense but will have to compete will the glare of a nearly \n<a href=\"ap010218.html\">full moon</a>.",
