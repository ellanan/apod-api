  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan you find two Earth shadows in today's image?\n\nIt's a bit tricky.\n\nTo find the first shadow, observe that the top part of the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/\">atmosphere</a> appears pink and the lower part appears blue. \n\nThis is because the top half is exposed to \n<a href=\"ap220727.html\">direct sunlight</a>, while the lower part is not.\n\nThe purple <a href=\"ap100404.html\">area</a> in between is known as the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus\">Belt of Venus</a>, \neven though Venus can only appear on the other side of the sky, near the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap191011.html\">blue color</a> of the lower atmosphere \nis caused by the Earth blocking sunlight, creating Earth shadow number 1.\n\nNow, where is the second Earth shadow? \n\nTake a <a href=\"ap220612.html\">look at the Moon</a>. \n\nDo you notice \n<a href=\"https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg\">something unusual</a> about the lower left part?\n\nThat area appears unusually dark because it is in the \n<a href=\"ap211201.html\">shadow of the Earth</a>, creating Earth shadow number 2.\n\nTo be precise, the \n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">Moon</a> was captured during a  \n<a href=\"ap180802.html\">lunar eclipse</a>. \n\nThis carefully timed image was taken in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yt3cXQbrvi8\">Sampieri</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily\">Sicily</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\">Italy</a>, in July 2018.",
