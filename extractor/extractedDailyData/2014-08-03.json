  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's that approaching?\n\nAstronauts on board the\n<a href=\"http://iss.cet.edu/\">International Space Station</a> \nfirst saw it in early 2010 far in the distance.  \n\nSoon it enlarged to become a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette\">dark silhouette</a>.\n\nAs it came even closer, the\n<a href=\"ap060921.html\">silhouette</a> appeared to be a spaceship.\n\nFinally, the object revealed itself to be the\n<a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/endeavour.html\">Space Shuttle Endeavour</a>, and it soon docked as expected with the\nEarth-orbiting space station.  \n\n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-130/html/iss022e062672.html\">Pictured above</a>, Endeavour was imaged near Earth's horizon as it approached, where several layers of the\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> were visible.\n\nDirectly behind the shuttle is the\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/mesosphere.html\">mesosphere</a>, which appears blue.  \n\nThe atmospheric layer that appears white is the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere\">stratosphere</a>,\nwhile the orange layer is Earth's\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere\">Troposphere</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=789JQPh3-o8\">shuttle mission</a>, began with a\n<a href=\"ap100209.html\">dramatic night launch</a>.\n\nTasks completed during this shuttle's visit to the \n<a href=\"ap090410.html\">ISS</a> included the delivery of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/stationpayloads/tranquility.html\">Tranquility Module</a> which contained a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS)\">cupola bay window complex</a> that allows \n<a href=\"ap101115.html\">even better views</a> of spaceships approaching and leaving the space station.",
