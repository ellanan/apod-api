  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLong before medieval alchemists dreamed of transmuting\nbase metals <a href=\"ap010405.html\">to gold</a>, stellar furnaces\nin this massive cluster\nof galaxies - cataloged as RDCS 1252.9-2927 - had transformed\n<a href=\"http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/nucleo.html\">light\nelements into heavy ones</a>.\n\nIn the <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2004/rdcs1252/\">false-color\ncomposite image</a> individual cluster galaxies can\nbe seen at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, shown\nin red, yellow, and green colors.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/xrays.html\">X-ray</a>\ndata (in purple) reveal the hot\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\ngalaxy_clusters.html\">intracluster gas</a>, enriched\nin heavy elements.\n\nAttracting the attention of astronomers using the orbiting\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/chronicle/\">Chandra</a> and\n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/\nindex.cfm?fareaid=23\">XMM-Newton</a> x-ray telescopes, as well as the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2004/01/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nand <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/paranal/\">ground based VLT</a>,\nthe galaxy cluster lies nearly 9\n<a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/\npart8/section-14.html\">billion light-years away</a> ...\nand so existed at a time when the Universe was less\nthan 5 billion years old.\n\nA measured mass of more than 200\n<a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/\nlarge.html\">trillion</a> Suns makes this galaxy cluster\nthe most massive object ever found when the Universe was so young.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309546\">cluster\nelemental abundances</a> are consistent with the idea\nthat most heavy elements were synthesized early on by massive stars,\nbut current theories suggest that such a massive cluster should\nbe rare in the <a href=\"http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu/project/\nannouncements/press/2004-1.html\">early Universe</a>.",
