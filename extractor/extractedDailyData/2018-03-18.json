  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nNo one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this.\n\nThat's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33_tUHDkMY\">only one side</a>. \n\nGiven modern digital technology, however, combined with many detailed images returned by the \n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO), a high resolution virtual \n<a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/790-A-Unique-View-Of-The-Moon.html\">Moon rotation movie</a> has been composed.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUNB6CMnE8\">above time-lapse video</a> \nstarts with the standard Earth \n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/moon/\">view of the Moon</a>.\n\nQuickly, though, \n<a href=\"ap110312.html\">Mare Orientale</a>, a large crater with a dark center \nthat is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator.  \n\nFrom an entire \n<a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/19699/does-the-moon-rotate/\">lunar month</a> condensed into 24 seconds, \nthe video clearly shows that the Earth side of \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">the Moon</a> contains an abundance of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maria_on_the_Moon\">dark lunar maria</a>, \nwhile the lunar far side is dominated by bright \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon#Highlands\">lunar highlands</a>.\n\nCurrently, over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon#Funded_lunar_probe_missions_currently_under_development\">20 new missions to the Moon</a> are under active development from four different countries, most of which have expected launch dates either this year or next.",
