  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nNGC 2359 is a helmet-shaped cosmic cloud with\nwing-like appendages popularly called Thor's Helmet.\n\nHeroically sized even for a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor\">Norse god</a>,\nThor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across.\n\nIn fact, the helmet is more like\n<a href=\"ap131214.html\">an interstellar bubble</a>, blown as a fast\nwind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center inflates\na region within the surrounding molecular cloud.\n\nKnown as a\n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/a-wolf-rayet-bubble-and-the-early-solar-system/\">Wolf-Rayet star</a>,\nthe central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief,\npre-<a href=\"ap050910.html\">supernova</a> stage of evolution.\n\nNGC 2359 <a href=\"ap100319.html\">is located</a> about\n15,000 light-years away in the constellation of the \n<a href=\"http://www.internal.org/view_poem.phtml?poemID=115\">Great Overdog</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.martinpughastrophotography.space/thors-helmet\">remarkably sharp image</a>\nis a mixed cocktail of data from broadband and narrowband filters using\nthree different telescopes.\n\nIt captures natural looking stars and the details of\n<a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/118/2/948\">the nebula's</a>\nfilamentary structures.\n\nThe predominant bluish hue is strong emission from doubly ionized\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium\">oxygen atoms</a>\nin the glowing gas.",
