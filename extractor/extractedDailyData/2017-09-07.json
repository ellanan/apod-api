  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn clear Madras, Oregon skies, this colorful eclipse\ncomposite captured the\n<a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/chromosphere\">elusive\nchromospheric</a> or flash spectrum of the Sun.\n\nOnly three exposures, made on August 21 with telephoto lens and\ndiffraction grating, are aligned in the frame.\n\nDirectly imaged at the far left, the Sun's\n<a href=\"ap170825.html\">diamond ring-like</a> appearance\nat the beginning and end of totality brackets a \nsilhouette of the lunar disk at maximum eclipse.\n\nSpread by the\n<a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/lightandcolor/\ndiffractionhome.html\">diffraction</a> grating into\nthe spectrum of colors toward the right, the Sun's\n<a href=\"ap131002.html\">photospheric spectrum</a>\ntraces the two continuous streaks.\n\nThey correspond to the diamond ring glimpses of the\nSun's normally overwhelming disk.\n\nBut individual eclipse images also appear at each wavelength of light\nemitted by atoms along the thin, fleeting arcs of\n<a href=\"ap131108.html\">the solar chromosphere</a>.\n\nThe brightest images, or strongest\n<a href=\"http://dailysolar.weebly.com/uploads/3/4/8/5/3485153/\n9810884.jpg\">chromospheric emission</a>,\nare due to Hydrogen atoms.\n\nRed hydrogen alpha emission is at the far right with blue\nand purple hydrogen series emission to the left.\n\nIn between, the brightest yellow emission is caused by atoms of\nHelium,\nan element <a href=\"ap980516.html\">only first discovered</a> in the\n<a href=\"http://www.phys.vt.edu/~heremans/Astrolab1156/Readings/\nflash.html\">flash spectrum of the Sun</a>.",
