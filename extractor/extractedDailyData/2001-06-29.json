  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes these unusual cone-shaped features on \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a>?  \n\nSpanning an average of only 100 meters at the base, \n<a href=\"http://astronomy.com/Content/Dynamic/Articles/000/000/000/519asmec.asp\">these small cones</a> appear near massive \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?mars+and+volcanoes\">Martian volcanoes</a> such as \n<a href=\"ap981019.html\">Olympus Mons</a>.  \n\nNear the cones are also \n<a href=\"ap980205.html\">dry channels</a> and eroded banks.  \n\nGiven these clues, some \n<a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/toc/gl/gl_28_12.html\">scientists speculate</a> \nthat the cones were formed by \n<a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/frequent_questions/group1_new.html\">lava</a> heating ice lying just below the \n<a href=\"ap000514.html\">Martian surface</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1979JGR....84.8048A\">Lava heated ice</a> would vaporize and expand, \npunching holes in the <a href=\"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/HawaiiQuest/gen_hawaii_volcs/question13.html\">cooling lava flow</a> as it escaped.  \n\nInterestingly, \n<a href=\" http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/current_volcs/current.html\">nearby volcanoes</a> may have erupted as \nrecently as 10 million years ago, indicating the \n<a href=\" http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/liquid.html\">equatorial near-ground ice</a> existed in the recent past, \nand therefore may also exist there today.",
