  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nFar across the universe, an unusual \n<a href=\"http://crux.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters.html\">cluster of galaxies</a> has been evolving.  \nA diverse group of galaxies populate this cluster, \nincluding, on the left, an unusual galaxy showing an \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1986MNRAS.219..657S\">equatorial polar ring</a> and a \n<a href=\"ap961030.html\">large spiral</a>.  \n\nAbove looms a large \n<a href=\"ap961106.html\">elliptical galaxy</a>.  \nThe reason for the small size of galaxies on the \nright is not yet known - these galaxies might be smaller \nor might just lie even farther in the distance.  \n\nAlmost every spot in \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/pr-14-98.html\">this picture</a> is a galaxy.  Studying \n<a href=\"ap980908.html\">distant clusters</a> \nlike this may help astronomers better understand \nwhen and how these cosmic giants formed.",
