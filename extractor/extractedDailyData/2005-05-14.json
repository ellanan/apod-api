  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSimilar in size and grand design to our\n<a href=\"http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/galaxy.html\">own\nMilky Way</a>, spiral galaxy NGC 3370 lies about 100 million\nlight-years away toward the constellation Leo.\n\nRecorded\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/24/\">here\nin exquisite detail</a> by the Hubble Space Telescope's\n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a>,\nthe big, beautiful face-on spiral does steal the show,\nbut the sharp image also reveals an impressive array of\nbackground galaxies in the field, strewn across\nthe more distant Universe.\n\nLooking within NGC 3370,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/24/fastfacts\">the\nimage data</a> has proved sharp enough\nto study individual pulsating stars known as\n\n<a href=\"ap000903.html\">Cepheids which</a>\ncan be used to accurately determine this galaxy's distance.\n\nNGC 3370 was chosen for this study because in 1994\nthe spiral galaxy was also home to a well studied stellar\nexplosion -- a type Ia supernova.\n\nCombining the known distance to this\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/cosmology/\ncosmicd.html\">standard candle supernova</a>,\nbased on the Cepheid measurements, with observations\nof supernovae at even <a href=\"ap980114.html\">greater distances</a>,\ncan reveal the size and expansion rate of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm\">Universe\nitself</a>.",
