Although \n<a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon/Apollo17/A17metric2444.gif\">Copernicus</a> is relatively young for a lunar crater, \nit was formed nearly a billion years ago by a <a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon/science/craterstructure.html\">colossal impact</a>.  The center of <a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon/Apollo17/\nA17_Photography_metric.html#Copernicus\">Copernicus</a> is about 93 kilometers across.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon/science/craterstructure.html#Copernicus\">above picture</a> was taken in 1972 by the \nlast human mission to the moon: \n<a href=\"ap970905.html\">Apollo 17</a>.  \nThe prospects for a return have been boosted recently with \nincreased evidence of \n<a href=\"http://george.arc.nasa.gov/dx/basket/pressrelease/98_47AR.html\">ice deposits near the lunar poles</a>.",
