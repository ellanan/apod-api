  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Here is one of the largest objects that anyone\nwill ever see on the sky. Each of the fuzzy blobs in the above\npicture is a <a href=\"ap950913.html\">galaxy</a>, together making\nup the <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E473%2E%2E%2E81K\">Perseus Cluster</a>,\none of the closest <a href=\"http://crux.astr.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>.\nWe view the cluster through the foreground of faint stars in our\nown <a href=\"ap970315.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. It takes light\nroughly 300 million years to get here from there, so we only see\nthis cluster as it existed during the age of the dinosaurs. Also\nknown as Abell 426, the center of Perseus cluster is a prodigious\n<a href=\"ap950902.html\">source of X-ray radiation</a>, and so\nhelps astronomers study how clusters formed and how <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#hydrogen\">gas</a>\nand <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/matter.html\">dark matter</a>\ninteract. The Perseus Cluster of Galaxies is part of the <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1993A%26A%2E%2E%2E280%2E%2E%2E20B\">Pisces-Perseus supercluster</a>\nof galaxies, which spans over 15 degrees and contains over 1000\ngalaxies.",
