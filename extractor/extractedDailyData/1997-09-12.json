  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSomething is lighting up the center of galaxy NGC 6251.  <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997ApJ%2E%2E%2E486L%2E%2E91C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Leading speculation</a> holds that it is a large \n<a href=\"ap970405.html\">black hole</a> \nnot shrouded by gas and \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a> typically found near the \n<a href=\"ap970114.html\">center of a galaxy</a>.  \nObservations taken with the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nand  <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/28/PR.html\">released earlier this week</a> indicate a new perspective on the \n<a href=\"lib/quasars.html\">strange beasts</a> \nthat rule the centers of galaxies: \na bright central object that is illuminating a \nsurrounding material disk, shown in blue.  \nThe lack of reflection from the upper part of the disk indicates \nthat this disk is warped in shape.  Although not visible in the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/28.html\">above composite image</a>, a \n<a href=\"ap970613.html\">huge plasma jet</a> streams out \nfrom the central object, \nperpendicular to the warped disk.",
