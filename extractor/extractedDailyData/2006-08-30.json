  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is sunspot 905 backwards?  \n\nPerhaps it is a key marker for the beginning of a new magnetic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle\">cycle on our Sun</a>.  \n\nEvery 11 years, our Sun goes through a \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/sun/magnetic.html\">magnetic cycle</a>, at the end of which its overall \n<a href=\"http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrsp-2005-1&amp;page=articlesu11.html\">magnetic orientation</a> is reversed.   \n\nAn 11-year solar cycle has been observed for hundreds of years by \nnoting peaks and valleys in the average number of \n<a href=\"ap051106.html\">sunspots</a>.\n\nJust now, the Sun is near \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/18oct_solarminimum.htm\">Solar Minimum</a>, and likely to start a \nlong progression toward the most active time, called \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/outreach/solarmax/\">Solar Maximum</a>, in about 5.5 years.  \n\nAn indicator that the sun's magnetic field is reversing is the \nappearance of sunspots with the reverse magnetic polarity than normal.  \n\nA few weeks ago, one small \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/15aug_backwards.htm\">candidate reverse sunspot</a> was sighted but faded quickly. \n\nNow, however, a larger sunspot with negative polarity is being tracked.  \n\nThis sunspot, numbered 905, appears as the unusual white spot in the \n<a href=\"http://mdisas.nascom.nasa.gov/gif_summary/mag/smdi_maglc_fd_20060825_1117.gif\">above magnetic image</a> of the Sun taken with the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory\">SOHO spacecraft</a> a few days ago.   \n\nIn the past few days, \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/\">Sunspot 905</a> has actually begun to break apart and might also become the source of \n<a href=\"ap000309.html\">coronal mass ejections</a> and explosive \n<a href=\"ap060502.html\">solar flares</a>.\n\nSolar astronomers predict that the coming \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/10mar_stormwarning.htm\">Solar Maximum</a> will be unusually active.",
