  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe surface of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/io.html\">Io</a> \nis changing even as we watch.  The inset frame of \n<a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/jupiter.htm\">Jupiter</a>'s \nmost active moon was taken \nby the robot spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/spacecraft.html\">Galileo</a> in April.  \nJust last month the \n<a href=\"http://galileo.ivv.nasa.gov/callisto/p49344.html\">larger image</a> was taken.  The new large black spot reveals that a \nvolcano named \n<a href=\"ap970818.html\">Pillan Patera</a> \nhas been erupting during the interim.  A vast moonscape\nroughly the size of \n<a href=\"http://www.state.az.us/\">Arizona</a> \nhas just been covered by some dark material.  <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1997Icar%2E%2E127%2E%2E221S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">What is this material?</a>\nIt's composition remains unknown although it is certainly \ndifferent in color from the red material seen surrounding volcano \n<a href=\"ap970623.html\">Pele</a> on the upper left.",
