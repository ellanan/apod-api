  "explanation": "<b>  </b>  \n\nThis exceptionally bright\n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/fireball/index.html\">fireball meteor</a>\ntrail was photographed with\na fish-eye camera at a Czech Republic station of\n<a href=\"http://www.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/I6/\nColleagues/molau/meteore/imc97-2.html\">the European Fireball Network</a>\non January 21, 1999.\n\nOf the <a href=\"ap980912.html\">star trails</a>\nvisible in this night-long exposure,\nthe bright short arc in the upper left is due to\n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/badpole.html\">Polaris, the north star</a>.\n\nThe breaks seen near the beginning of the fireball trail itself\nwere produced by a shutter rotating 15 times a second.\n\nIn all, three stations recorded the dazzling streak\nand their combined tracking information has revealed details\n<a href=\"http://www-space.arc.nasa.gov/~leonid/meteors.html\">of the meteor's</a>\nbrief atmospheric flight and previous interplanetary voyage.\n\nFor example,\nthe luminous trail is measured to begin at an altitude of 81.9 kilometers\nand covered 71.1 kilometers in 6.7 seconds.\n\nThe projected\nprior orbit for the meteoroid corresponds to one\ntypical for Apollo\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">class asteroids</a> which can cross Earth's orbit.\n\nIn forty years of operations the European Network has multistation\nrecordings of less than\n10 or so fireballs as bright as this one.\n\nIt is thought likely that a small (a few hundred grams)\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteorite</a>\nsurvived this fiery fall to Earth and landed near the Czech-Poland border.",
