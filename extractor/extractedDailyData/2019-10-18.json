  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nAfter the 2017 detecton of 1I/'Oumuamua,\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/hubble-observes-1st-confirmed-interstellar-comet\">comet\n2I/Borisov</a> has become\nthe second recognized interstellar interloper.\n\nLike 'Oumuamua, Borisov's measured hyperbolic trajectory and speed as\nit falls toward the Sun confirm that its origin is from\nbeyond our Solar System.\n\nBut while detailed observations indicate\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/\">'Oumuamua is a rocky body</a>\nwith differences from known Solar System objects,\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2019/news-2019-53\">\nBorisov is definitely a far wandering comet</a>.\n\nTaken on October 12, 2019 this\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2019/53/4578-Image\">\nHubble Space Telescope image of Borisov</a>\nreveals a familiar looking comet-like activity\nand concentration of dust around around its nucleus.\n\nNot resolved in the image, some estimates suggest the nucleus could be\nbetween 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter.\n\nAt the time of the Hubble image,\ncomet 2I/Borisov was about 418 million kilometers away.\n\nBorisov is still inbound though and will make its closest approach\nto the Sun on December 7 at\na distance of about 300 million kilometers (2 Astronomical units).",
