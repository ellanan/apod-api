  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it be like to see a sunset on Mars?  \n\nTo help find out, the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040104a.html\">robotic rover Spirit</a> was deployed last month \nto park and serenely watch the Sun dip below the distant lip of \n<a href=\"ap020627.html\">Gusev crater</a>.  \n\nIt was a tough job, but some robot had to do it.  \n\nNow on Earth a red sunset is caused by two effects -- by blue light being \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html\">preferentially scattered</a> out of sunlight by \n<a href=\"http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/8.html\">oxygen</a> and \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">nitrogen</a> molecules in the atmosphere, \nand by scattering off a small amount of impurities like \n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/air/sun.rxml\">volcanic dust</a>.  \n\n(The magnitude of the first effect was computed in one of Albert \n<a href=\"http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/17/2/2/1\">Einstein's most cited \npapers</a>.)\n\nAlthough Mars lacks oxygen and nitrogen, it is covered in \n<a href=\"ap030819.html\">red dust</a> frequently \nhoisted into the atmosphere by \n<a href=\"ap050426.html\">fast</a> but \n<a href=\"ap990112.html\">thin winds</a>.  \n\nAnalyses of images like the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07997\">above photograph</a> show that at least some \nMartian days are capped by a \n<a href=\"ap970804.html\">sunset</a> significantly \nlonger and redder than typical on Earth.  \n\nFor up to two hours after twilight, sunlight continued to reflect off \n<a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug04/Mars.Science.bpf.html\">Martian dust</a> high in the atmosphere, casting a diffuse glow.  \n\nThe result helps atmospheric scientists understand not only the \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Mars/atmosphere.html\">atmosphere of Mars</a>, but atmospheres across the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>, \nincluding our \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html\">home Earth</a>.",
