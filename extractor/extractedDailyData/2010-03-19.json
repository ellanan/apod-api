  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSeen as a seagull and a duck, these nebulae are\nnot the only\n<a href=\"ap080719.html\">cosmic clouds</a> to\n<a href=\"ap090910.html\">evoke images</a> of flight.\n\nBut both are winging their way across this broad\ncelestial landscape, spanning almost 7 degrees across\n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/\">planet Earth's night sky</a>\ntoward the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.knoxvilleobservers.org/dsonline/winter/\ncanishead.html\">Canis Major</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap090327.html\">expansive Seagull</a>\n(upper left) is itself composed\nof two major cataloged\n<a href=\"ap050930.html\">emission nebulae</a>.\n\nBrighter NGC 2327 forms the head with the more diffuse\nIC 2177 as the wings and body.\n\nImpressively, the Seagull's\nwingspan would correspond to about 250 light-years at\nan estimated distance of 3,800 light-years.\n\nAt the lower right, the Duck appears much more compact and\nwould span only about 50 light-years given its\n15,000 light-year distance estimate.\n\nBlown by energetic winds from an extremely massive,\nhot star near its center, the Duck nebula is cataloged\n<a href=\"http://seds.org/~spider/ngc/ngc.cgi?2359\">as NGC 2359</a>.\n\nOf course, the Duck's thick body and winged appendages\nalso lend it a more dramatic popular moniker --\n<a href=\"ap080117.html\">Thor's Helmet</a>.",
