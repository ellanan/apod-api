  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA careful look at\nthis colorful cosmic snapshot reveals a surprising number of\ngalaxies both near and far toward the constellation\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major\">Ursa Major</a>.\n\nThe most striking is\n<a href=\"http://www.kopernik.org/images/archive/n3718.htm\">NGC 3718</a>,\nthe warped spiral galaxy near picture center.\n\nNGC 3718's spiral arms look\n<a href=\"ap060108.html\">twisted and extended</a>,\nmottled with young blue star clusters.\n\nDrawn out dust lanes obscure its yellowish central regions.\n\nA mere 150 thousand light-years to the right\nis another large spiral galaxy, NGC 3729.\n\nThe two are likely\n<a href=\"http://burro.astr.case.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/\ndynamic.html\">interacting gravitationally</a>,\naccounting for the <a href=\"ap051008.html\">peculiar</a>\nappearance of NGC 3718.\n\nWhile this galaxy pair lies about 52 million light-years away,\nthe remarkable\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/\nHickson/Hickson_contents.html\">Hickson</a> Group 56 can also be\nseen clustered above NGC 3718, near the top of the frame.\n\nHickson\n<a href=\"http://www.kopernik.org/images/archive/hick56.htm\">Group 56</a>\nconsists of five\ninteracting galaxies and lies over 400 million light-years away.\n\nThis picture was chosen as the overall winner in the 2013\nDavid Malin Astrophotography Competition.",
