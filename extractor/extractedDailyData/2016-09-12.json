  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA little spacecraft that was presumed lost has now been found.\n\nIn 2014, the Philae lander slowly descended from its parent \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)\">Rosetta spacecraft</a> \nto the nucleus of \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/14615-comet-67p/\">Comet C67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>.\n\nAt the surface, after a harpoon malfunction, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_(spacecraft)\">the lander</a> bounced softly twice and eventually sent back images from an \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/01/30/where-is-philae-when-will-it-wake-up/\">unknown location</a>. \n\nEarlier this month, though, \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/2279-summary/\">Rosetta</a> swooped low enough to \n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/58221-philae-found/\">spot its cub</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap141112.html\">meter-sized Philae</a> is seen on the far right of the \n<a href=\" http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/58224-osiris-narrow-angle-camera-image-with-philae-2-september/\">main image</a>, \nwith inset images showing both a zoom out and a zoom in.\n\nAt the end of this month, Rosetta itself will be directed to land on \n<a href=\"ap160202.html\">67P</a>, but Rosetta's landing will be harder and, although taking unique images and data, will bring the mission  \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2016/09/09/rosettas-descent-towards-region-of-active-pits/\">to an end</a>.",
