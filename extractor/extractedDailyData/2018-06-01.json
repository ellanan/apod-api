  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSince the distance from Earth to Mars changes drastically as\nthe planets orbit the Sun, Mars' appearance changes dramaticaly.\n\n<a href=\"ap180412.html\">Mars is bright</a> now, and it's getting closer and\n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/\nwhy-is-mars-sometimes-bright-and-sometimes-faint\">brighter still</a> as\nit orbits toward its 2018 <a href=\"ap140411.html\">opposition</a> and\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/\nmars-close-approach/\">closest approach to Earth</a> in late July.\n\nThis sequence of sharp telescopic images records the Red Planet's\nsteady increase in apparent size for the months of\nJanuary (top left) through April.\n\nDuring that time its distance from Earth went from 284 million\nkilometers in January to 129 million kilometers in April,\nand so its apparent size more than doubled.\n\nAt closest approach Mars will be about 58 million kilometers distant, more\nthan doubling in apparent size compared to the disk at the lower right.\n\nBy then it will rival the brightness\n<a href=\"ap180503.html\">of Jupiter</a> in planet Earth's\nnight sky, but don't believe the claims of the inevitable\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/\n25aug_marshoax/\">internet hoax</a>.",
