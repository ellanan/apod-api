  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis galaxy is unusual for how many stars it seems that you can see.\n\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/\">Stars</a> are so abundantly evident in this \ndeep exposure of the spiral galaxy NGC 300 because so many of these stars are \n<a href=\"ap221205.html\">bright blue and grouped</a> \ninto resolvable bright star clusters. \n\nAdditionally, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_300\">NGC 300</a> \nis so clear because it is one of the closest \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy\">spiral galaxies</a> to Earth, as \nlight takes only about 6 million years to get here. \n\nOf course, galaxies are composed of many more <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/askastronomy/comments/1g8ftr0/from_the_perspective_of_other_stars_in_the_milky/\">faint stars</a> than bright, \nand even more of a galaxy's mass is attributed to unseen \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/dark-matter/\">dark matter</a>. \n\n<a href=\"ap020821.html\">NGC 300</a> spans nearly the same amount of sky as the \n<a href=\"ap240915.html\">full moon</a> and is visible with a small telescope toward the southern constellation of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor_(constellation)\">Sculptor</a>.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DChWdQOOQzR/\">featured image</a> was captured in October from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/a5jUyVPIDAk\">Rio Hurtado</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile\">Chile</a> and \nis a \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhat-do-you-call-a-pile-of-kittens-a-meowntain-our-11yo-v0-5u4lbl0trml81.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D256b968c218e77e5edd1aece91ae1182c7eb6abb\">composite</a> of over 20 hours of exposure.",
