  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to orbit a black hole?\n\nSince the strong gravity of the black hole can significantly alter light paths, \nconditions would indeed <a href=\"ap101207.html\">look strange</a>. \n\nFor one thing, the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N\">entire sky would be visible</a>, \nsince even stars behind the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/home.html\">black hole</a> would have their light bent to the observer's eye.\n\nFor another, the sky near the black hole would appear \n<a href=\"http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/movies.html\">significantly distorted</a>, \nwith more and more images of the entire sky visible increasingly near the black hole.\n\nMost visually striking, perhaps, is the outermost sky image \ncompletely contained inside an easily discernible circle known as the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring\">Einstein ring</a>.\n\nOrbiting a black hole, as shown in the above scientifically-accurate \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ascl.soft10006N\">computer-created</a> \nillustrative video, will show stars that pass nearly directly \nbehind the black hole as zipping around rapidly near the Einstein ring.\n\nAlthough star images near the \n<a href=\"ap111221.html\">Einstein ring</a> \nmay appear to move \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html\">faster than light</a>, no star is actually \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=21005\">moving that quickly</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb_RrZhNf2Q\">above video</a> is part of a \n<a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">sequence of videos</a> \nvisually exploring the space near a black hole's \n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/BlackHoleAnat.html\">event horizon</a>.\n\n<i>(Disclosure: Video creator Robert Nemiroff is an editor for APOD.)</i>",
