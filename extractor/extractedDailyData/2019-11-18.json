  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to pass asteroid Arrokoth?\n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/new-horizons/in-depth/\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> zoomed past Arrokoth in January, \n3.5 years after the spacecraft passed \n<a href=\"ap190910.html\">Pluto</a>. \n\nIf this object's name \n<a href=\"https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/confused-dog-400.jpg\">doesn't sound familiar</a>, \nthat may be because the distant, double-lobed, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/in-depth/\">Kuiper-belt object</a> was unofficially dubbed Ultima Thule until recently \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/far-far-away-in-the-sky-new-horizons-kuiper-belt-flyby-object-officially-named-arrokoth\">receiving its official</a> name: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/486958_Arrokoth\">486958 Arrokoth</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Press-Conferences/index.php?page=2019-03-18\">featured black and white video</a> \nanimates images of Arrokoth taken by New Horizons at \n<a href=\"ap190104.html\">different angles</a> as it zoomed by. \n\nThe video clearly shows \n<a href=\"ap190522.html\">Arrokoth's two lobes</a>, and even hints that the larger lobe is significantly flattened. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons\">New Horizons</a> found that Arrokoth is different from any known asteroid in the \ninner Solar System and is likely composed of two joined \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetesimal\">planetesimal</a>s -- the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1Invdzybs\">building blocks of planets</a> \nas they existed billions of years ago.\n\n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/2019-Onward.php\">New Horizons continues</a> to speed out of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> gaining about three additional \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit\">Earth-Sun separations</a> every year.",
