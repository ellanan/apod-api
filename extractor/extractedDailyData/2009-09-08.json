  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTwo months ago, something unexpected hit Jupiter.\n\n<a href=\"ap090723.html\">First discovered</a> by an amateur astronomer\n<a href=\"http://jupiter.samba.org/\">Anthony Wesley</a> on 2009 July 19,\nthe impact was quickly confirmed and even\n<a href=\"ap090731.html\">imaged</a> by the\n<a href=\"ap090525.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> during the next week.\n\nMany of the\n<a href=\"http://astro.nineplanets.org/bigeyes.html\">world's telescopes</a>\nthen zoomed in on our Solar System's\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/jupiter_worldbook.html\">largest planet</a> to see the result.\n\nSome of these images have been complied into the\n<a href=\"http://www.ceastronomy.org/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=6848\">above animation</a>.\n\nOver the course of the last month and a half, the\n<a href=\"http://www.ceastronomy.org/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=6848\">above time-lapse sequence</a> shows the dark spot -- first created when\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Jupiter_impact\">Jupiter was struck</a> -- deforming and dissipating as\n<a href=\"ap970920.html\">Jupiter</a>'s clouds churned and\n<a href=\"ap070312.html\">Jupiter rotated</a>.  \n\nIt is now thought that a small comet -- perhaps less than one kilometer across --\n<a href=\"ap001105.html\">impacted Jupiter</a> on or before 2009 July 19.\n\nAlthough initially expected to be\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za6I4INsLVQ\">visible</a> for only a week, astronomers continue to track atmospheric remnants of the impact for new information about winds and currents in\n<a href=\"ap031114.html\">Jupiter's thick atmosphere</a>.",
