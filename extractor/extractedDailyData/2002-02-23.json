  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFifteen years ago today, the\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/\nsn87a.html\">brightest supernova</a> of modern times\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/04300/04316.html\">was sighted</a>.\n\nOver time,\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/08/\ntimeline.html\">astronomers have watched</a> and waited for\nthe expanding debris from this tremendous stellar\nexplosion to crash into \n<a href=\"ap970812.html\">previously expelled material</a>.  \n\nA clear result of such a collision is demonstrated above\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/08/\">in two frames</a>\nrecorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994 (left)\nand 1997(right).\n\nWhile the central concentration of\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/03.html\">stellar\ndebris</a> has clearly evolved over this period,\nthe yellow spot on the ring in the righthand\npicture announces the collision of an outward\n<a href=\"http://wonka.physics.ncsu.edu/www/Astro/Research/Ring/\">moving\nblast wave</a> with the pre-existing, light-year wide ring.  \n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/08/\npr.html\">The collision</a> is occurring at speeds near \n60 million kilometers per hour and\n<a href=\"ap000512.html\">shock-heats</a> the\nring material causing it to glow.  \n\nAstronomers are hopeful that such collisions will\nilluminate the interesting past of\n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/StarDeath/\nsn1987a.html\">SN 1987A</a>, and perhaps provide more clues \nabout the origin of the <a href=\"ap960705.html\">mysterious rings</a>.",
