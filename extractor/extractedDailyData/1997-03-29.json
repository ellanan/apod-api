  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: What's the closest galaxy to our <a href=\"ap970315.html\">Milky Way</a>?\nFor many years astronomers thought it was the <a href=\"ap961023.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>\n(LMC). But the seemingly insignificant fuzzy patch shown above\nturned out to be part of a galaxy that is even closer. Deemed\nthe \"<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995MNRAS%2E277%2E%2E781I&amp;db_key=AST\">Sagittarius Dwarf</a>\",\nthis small galaxy went unnoticed until its discovery in 1994 by\nR. Ibata, G. Gilmore and M. Irwin (<a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/RGO/RGO.html\">RGO</a>).\nThe reason the Sagittarius Dwarf hadn't been discovered earlier\nis because it is so dim, it is so spread out over the sky, and\nthere are so many Milky Way stars in front of it. The distance\nto the <a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v459n2/5721/sc0.html\">Sagittarius Dwarf</a>\nwas recently measured to be about one third of the distance to\nthe LMC. Astronomers now believe that this galaxy is <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995ApJ%2E%2E%2E451%2E%2E598J\">slowly being torn apart</a>\nby the vast gravitational forces of our Galaxy.",
