  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA lake hidden beneath 19 meters of ice and gravel has been \nfound near the bottom of the world that might contain an \n<a href=\"http://museums.state.nm.us/nmmnh/SMNHC/lesson1-2.html\">ecosystem</a> completely separate from our own. \n\nIn a modern version of \n<a href=\"http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/acdsbio.html\">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s classic book \n<a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/doyle/lost_world/\">Lost World</a>, scientists are now \n<a href=\"http://www.spacedaily.com/news/antarctic-02t.html\">plotting a mission</a> to drill down into the lake and \ntake out a small part to see what's there.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.newswise.com/articles/2002/12/VIDA.NSF.html\">Lake Vida</a>, buried under \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html\">Antarctic</a> ice for over 2,500 years, \nis liquid only because of its high \n<a href=\"http://www.saltinstitute.org/15.html\">salt</a> content. \n\nPreviously, scientists drilled to within a few meters \nof the lake and indeed found frozen \n<a href=\"http://www.microbe.org/\">microbes</a>.  \n\nTheir existence bolsters speculation that similar \n<a href=\"ap020930.html\">microorganisms</a> could be \nfound in frozen brine beneath the surface of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/\">Mars</a>.  \n\nIf <a href=\"http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ploct97.htm\">living organisms</a> are found in Lake Vida, they may give an \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002LPI....33.1134A\">indication</a> that \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002SPIE.4495..313H\">life might even still exist</a> under similar \n<a href=\"ap021226.html\">frozen ice-sheets</a>, such as under the larger \n<a href=\"http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~mstuding/vostok.html\">Lake Vostok</a>, parts of Mars, and even moons of \n<a href=\"jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> such as \n<a href=\"ap021101.html\">Europa</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://huey.colorado.edu/LTER/datasets/meteorology/vida.html\">Pictured above</a>, a robot meteorological station continues to\nmonitor surface conditions over the ice-sealed lake.",
