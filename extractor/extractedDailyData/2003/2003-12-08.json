  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe Sun, the Moon, and two photographers all lined up last month in \n<a href=\"ap991116.html\">Antarctica</a> during an unusual \n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/TSE2003/TSE2003.html\">total eclipse</a> of the Sun.  \n\nEven given the extreme location, a group of \n<a href=\"http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html\">enthusiastic eclipse chasers</a> ventured near the \nbottom of the world to experience the surreal momentary \ndisappearance of the <a href=\"ap010706.html\">Sun behind the Moon</a>.  \n\nOne of the treasures collected was the \n<a href=\"http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html\">above picture</a> -- a composite of four separate images \ndigitally combined to realistically simulate how the adaptive human \n<a href=\"ap010408.html\">eye saw</a> the eclipse.  \n\nAs the image was taken, both the \n<a href=\"ap031127.html\">Moon and the Sun</a> \npeaked together over an Antarctic ridge.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"ap030106.html\">sudden darkness</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap031122.html\">magnificent corona</a> \nof the Sun became visible around the Moon.  \n\nQuite by accident, another photographer was caught \nin one of the images checking his video camera.   \n\nVisible to his left are an equipment bag and a collapsible chair.",
