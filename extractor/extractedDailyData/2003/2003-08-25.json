  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMany of the stars in our home \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/mw.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> appear together as a dim band \non the sky that passes nearly over the Earth's \n<a href=\"ap020818.html\">north</a> and south poles.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOWCASE/NMW.HTM\">Pictured above</a> is the part of \n<a href=\"milky_way.html\">our Galaxy</a> that passes \nclosest over the north <a href=\"ap000715.html\">pole</a>.  \n\nPlacing your <a href=\"http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/cursor\">cursor</a> over the image will bring up the names of several <a href=\"http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/history/exhibits/constellations/timeline.html\">constellations</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/brightest.html\">bright stars</a>. \n\nThe diffuse white Galaxy glow is created by billions of stars, \nwhile red patches are large \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebulas</a>, \nusually marking areas where bright stars have recently formed.  \n\nIn the north, all of the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">lights visible at night</a> and all lights that created \nthis image were emitted within the past few thousand years \nfrom within the Milky Way Galaxy -- except one.  \n\nOn the upper right is a small faint patch designated M31, the \n<a href=\"ap021021.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>.  \n\nM31 is a <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/spir.html\">spiral galaxy</a> similar to our \n<a href=\"ap990224.html\">Milky Way</a> but so distant it emits the oldest light distinguishable by the unaided eye -- \nlight that takes over two million years to reach us.",
