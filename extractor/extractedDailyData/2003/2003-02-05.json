  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat could have formed these unusual channels?  \n\nInside Newton Basin on\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a>, numerous narrow channels run from the \ntop down to the floor.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/e7_e12_captioned_rel/index.html\">above picture</a> covers a region spanning about 1500 meters across.  \n\nThese and other \n<a href=\"ap021024.html\">gullies</a> have been found on Mars in \n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/june2000/index.html\">recent high-resolution pictures</a> taken by the orbiting \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/overview.html\">Mars Global Surveyor</a> robot spacecraft.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/june2000/labeled/index.html\">Similar channels on Earth</a> are formed by flowing water, \nbut on Mars the temperature is normally too cold and the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/mars/lower_atmosphere.html\">atmosphere</a> too thin to sustain \n<a href=\"ap981007.html\">liquid water</a>.  \n\nNevertheless, many scientists hypothesize that \nliquid groundwater can sometimes surface on  \n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a>, erode gullies and channels, \nand pool at the bottom before freezing and evaporating.  \n\nIf so, life-sustaining \n<a href=\"ap980530.html\">ice and water</a> might exist \neven today below the \n<a href=\"ap000514.html\">Martian surface</a> -- \nwater that could potentially support a \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/marsoxygen.html\">human mission to Mars</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000E2998-F791-1CF3-93F6809EC5880000\">Research into this exciting possibility</a> is sure to continue!",
