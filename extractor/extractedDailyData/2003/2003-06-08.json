  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/rhea.html\">Rhea</a> \nis the second largest moon of \n<a href=\"http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/choices/saturn1.htm\">Saturn</a>, \nbehind <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/titan.html\">Titan</a>, \nand the largest without an atmosphere. \n\nIt is composed mostly of water ice, but has a small rocky core. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/rhea.htm\">Rhea</a>'s \nrotation and orbit are locked together (just like \n<a href=\"ap010218.html\">Earth's Moon</a>) \nso that one side always faces Saturn. \n\nA consequence of this is that one side always leads the other. \n\nRhea's leading surface is much more heavily cratered than its trailing\nsurface. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sat/rhea2.htm\">above photograph</a> was taken with the \n<a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.html\">Voyager 1 spacecraft</a> in 1980. \n\nNASA's <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/\">Cassini spacecraft</a> is currently on route to Saturn and \nwill arrive in 2004.",
