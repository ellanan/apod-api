  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap030424.html\">As the Sun sets</a>, the Earth's\nshadow rises up from the east.\n\nThe subtle beauty of\n<a href=\"http://webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/14E.html\">this\ndaily apparition</a> is often overlooked\nin favor of the brighter, <a href=\"ap021110.html\">more colorful</a>\nwestern horizon.\n\nBut while gazing toward a nearly full rising Moon on August 9,\nastronomer Steve Mandel admired the shadow rise from his driveway\nnear Soquel, California, USA.\n\nHis view looks east from the northern tip of Monterey Bay toward\nFremont Peak, the highest point in the small mountain range on\nthe horizon.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.galaxyimages.com/earthshadow.html\">The\nEarth's rising shadow</a> is cast through the\ndense atmosphere and is seen in his picture as the dark blue band\nalong the horizon, bounded above by a pinkish purple glow or\nantitwilight arch.\n\nAlso known as the <a href=\"ap011209.html\">Belt of Venus</a>,\nthe arch's lovely color is due\nto backscattering of\n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/blue_sky.html\">reddened\nlight</a> from the <a href=\"ap980526.html\">setting Sun</a>.",
