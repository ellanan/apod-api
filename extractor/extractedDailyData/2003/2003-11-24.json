  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nRippling dust and gas lanes give the Flaming Star Nebula its name. \n\nThe red and purple colors of the nebula are present in \ndifferent regions and are created by different processes. \n\nThe bright star <a href=\"ap011204.html\">AE Aurigae</a>, \nvisible toward the image right, is so hot it is blue, \nemitting light so energetic it knocks \n<a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/welect.html\">electrons</a> away from surrounding gas. \n\nWhen a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton\">proton</a> recaptures an electron, \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hyde.html\">red light</a> is frequently emitted.\n\nThe purple region's color is a mix of this \nred light and blue light emitted by AE\n<a href=\"http://www3.pei.sympatico.ca/brian.gorveatt/auriga.html\">Aurigae</a> but reflected to us by surrounding \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a>.\n\nThe two regions are referred to as \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebula</a> and \n<a href=\"reflection_nebulae.html\">reflection nebula</a>, respectively. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/IC405Page.html\">Pictured above</a>, the Flaming Star Nebula, officially known as \n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/B_WINTER/IC405.HTM\">IC 405</a>, lies about 1500 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> distant, spans about 5 light years, \nand is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/aur.html\">Auriga</a>.",
