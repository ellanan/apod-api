  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat caused the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0834.html\">Crescent Nebula</a>? \n\nLooking like an emerging space \n<a href=\"ap010805.html\">cocoon</a>, the Crescent Nebula, \nvisible on the right, was created by the brightest star in its center.  \n\nA leading progenitor hypothesis has the \n<a href=\"ap000802.html\">Crescent Nebula</a> \nbeginning to form about 250,000 years ago.  \n\nAt that time, the massive central star had evolved to become a \n<a href=\"ap981109.html\">Wolf-Rayet star</a> (WR 136), \nshedding its outer envelope in a strong \n<a href=\"http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/Astronomy/SteWin.html\">stellar wind</a>, ejecting the equivalent of our \nSun's mass every 10,000 years. \n\nThis wind impacted surrounding gas left over from a \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/redsup.html\">previous phase</a>, compacting it into a series of \n<a href=\"ap020324.html\">complex shells</a>, and lighting it up. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000AJ....119.2991M\">Crescent Nebula</a>, also known as NGC 6888, lies about 4,700 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> away in the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/cyg.html\">Cygnus</a>. \n\nStar <a href=\"http://home.achilles.net/~jtalbot/spectra/WolfRayet.html\">WR</a> 136 will probably undergo a \n<a href=\"supernova_remnants.html\">supernova</a> \nexplosion sometime in the next million years.",
