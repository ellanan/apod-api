  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap980307.html\">This is NGC 1818</a>,\na youthful, glittering cluster\nof 20,000 stars residing in the\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/xtra/ngc/lmc.html\">Large\nMagellanic Cloud</a>, 180,000 light-years away.\n\nPick a star.  Any star.\n\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/16/\">Astronomers\nmight pick</a> the unassuming bluish-white  one (circled) which\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/behind_the_pictures/\nwacky_shape/index.shtml\">appears</a>\nto be a hot newly formed white dwarf star.\n\nWhat makes it so interesting?\n\nThe standard astronomical wisdom\nsuggests that stars over 5 times as massive as the\nsun <a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/\nStarDeath.html\">rapidly exhaust</a>\ntheir nuclear fuel and end their lives in a spectacular\n<a href=\"ap030528.html\">supernova explosion</a>.\n\nWith less than this <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/\nxmm_lc/edu/lessons/background-lifecycles.html\">critical mass</a>\nthey evolve into red giants, pass through a relatively \npeaceful <a href=\"ap020302.html\">planetary nebula</a> phase,\nand calmly fade away as\n<a href=\"ap000910.html\">white dwarf stars</a> like this one.\n\nExcept that as a member of the NGC 1818 cluster,\nthis new white dwarf would have evolved from\n<a href=\"http://www.historyoftheuniverse.com/starold.html\">a red\ngiant star</a> over 7.6 times as massive as the\nsun -- which should have exploded!\n\n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9802117\">Its discovery</a>\nwill likely force astronomers to revise the\nlimiting mass estimate for supernovae upward.",
