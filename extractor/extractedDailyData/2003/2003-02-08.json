  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis enhanced Hubble Space Telescope\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/1999/21/\">image\nshows in remarkable detail</a>\nthe inner portion of the disk of\n<a href=\"ap021011.html\">dust and gas surrounding</a> the star AB Aurigae.\n\nKnots of material, visible here for the first time, may well represent\nan early stage of a process which could result in the formation\n<a href=\"http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/\">of planets</a> over the\nnext few million years.\n\nAB <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Auriga.html\">Aurigae</a> is a young star\n(2-4 million years old), about 469 light-years distant.\n\nIts swirling\n<a href=\"ap960119.html\">circumstellar disk</a> is large,\nabout 30 times the size of\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/nineplanets.html\">our\nsolar system</a>.\n\nAstronomers believe\n<a href=\"http://www.psi.edu/projects/planets/planets.html\">planet-making</a>\nis just beginning in AB Aurigae's disk because\nknown disks surrounding younger stars (less than 1 million years old)\ndo not show such clumpy structure,\nwhile disks of slightly older stars\n(aged 8-10 million years) have gaps and\n<a href=\"ap990205.html\">features suggesting</a>\nthat planets have already been formed.\n\nWhy the window pane appearance?\n\nWide black stripes in the picture are caused by occulting bars used\nto block out the overwhelming starlight.\n\nThe diagonal streaks\nare due to <a href=\"ap971119.html\">diffraction spikes</a>.",
