  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFrom planet Earth, we view this strongly interacting\n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/ngc6621.html\">pair of galaxies</a>,\ncataloged as\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html\">Arp</a>\n81, as they were only about 100 million\nyears after their mutual closest approach.\n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307025\">The havoc wreaked</a>\nby gravity during their ominous encounter is\ndetailed in this color composite image from the Hubble Space Telescope,\nshowing twisted streams of gas and dust, a chaos of massive\n<a href=\"ap031209.html\">star formation</a>,\nand a <a href=\"ap020502.html\">tidal tail</a>\nstretching for 200 thousand light-years or so as it\nsweeps behind the <a href=\"ap981219.html\">cosmic wreckage</a>.\n\nAlso known as NGC 6622 (left) and NGC 6621, the galaxies are\nroughly equal in size but\nare destined to <a href=\"ap031010.html\">merge</a>\ninto one large galaxy in the\n<a href=\"http://www.npaci.edu/online/v4.9/galaxies2.html\">distant future</a>,\nmaking repeated approaches until they finally\n<a href=\"http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/NAS/NAS.html\">coalesce</a>.\n\nLocated in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dra/index.html\">Draco</a>,\nthe galaxies are 280 million\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/\nlightspeed.html\">light-years away</a>.\n\nThe dark vertical band which seems to run through NGC 6621's location is\na camera artifact.",
