  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nJon Burnett, a teenager from \n<a href=\"http://www.south-wales.org.uk/southwales/faqs.shtml\">South Wales</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uk.html\">UK</a>, was photographing some friends \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/skateboarding/trick.html\">skateboarding</a> last week when the sky did something very strange. \n\nBy diverting his camera, he was able to \n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/fireball/report.html\">document</a> this <a href=\"ap010728.html\">rare sky \nevent</a> and capture one of the more spectacular \nsky images yet recorded.  \n\nRoughly four minutes later, he took \n<a href=\"image/0310/fireball2_burnett_big.jpg\">another picture</a> of the dispersing trail.  \n\nWhat is it?  Experts disagree.  The first guess was\na sofa-sized rock that exploded as a daytime \n<a href=\"http://www.imo.net/fireball/\">fireball</a>, but perhaps a \nbetter hypothesis is an unusual airplane contrail reflecting the \nsetting Sun.\n\n<a href=\"ap011119.html\">Bright fireball</a>s \noccur over someplace on Earth nearly every day.  \n\nA separate <a href=\"ap981125.html\">bolide</a>, \nlikely even more dramatic, \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3149404.stm\">struck India</a> only a few days ago.",
