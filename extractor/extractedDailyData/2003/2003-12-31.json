  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis year, humanity learned that the universe is \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_age.html\">13.7 billion years old</a>.  \n\nBefore this year, the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/age.html\">universe's age</a> \nwas thought to be <i>about</i> 13 billion years, \nbut really only constrained to be between about 12 billion and \n15 billion years old.  \n\nThe difference was made, primarily, by a small satellite named the \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/ob_tech1.html\">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP) \nthat had been collecting data in an \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/ob_techorbit1.html\">unusual Earth orbit</a>.  \n\nPictured <a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_or.html\">above</a> is a sky map of the enabling data -- the complete \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/faq_basic.html\">cosmic microwave background</a> divided into two hemispheres, \nin detail never before resolved, as recorded by the WMAP's \nfirst data release.  \n\nBesides <a href=\"ap030217.html\">universe age</a>, new \n<a href=\"ap020529.html\">data</a> and analyses of the <a href=\"ap030212.html\">spots</a> on the \n<a href=\" http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/beginners/introduction.html\">cosmic microwave background</a> bolstered existing indications that the universe is composed predominantly of a \n<a href=\"ap011202.html\">strange</a> and mysterious type of \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate98.html\">dark energy</a> (73 percent).  \n\nThe remaining matter is only about 4 percent in familiar \n<a href=\"http://education.jlab.org/atomtour/\">atoms</a>, \nwith the remaining 23 percent in a somewhat mysterious type of \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter.html\">dark matter</a>.  \n\nDuring the year, much cosmological research shifted from \ntrying to <i>find</i> the \n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Plionis/Plionis1_1.html\">parameters</a> that define our \n<a href=\"http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/pub_papers/firstyear.html\">universe</a> to trying to <i>use</i> these parameters as a tool for understanding details of how our universe evolved.",
