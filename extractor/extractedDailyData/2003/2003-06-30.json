  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis dense cloud of gas and dust is being deleted.  \n\nLikely, within a few million years, \nthe intense light from bright stars will have boiled it \naway completely.  \n\nStars not yet formed in the \n<a href=\"http://origins.jpl.nasa.gov/poster/bigbang3.html\">molecular cloud</a>'s interior\nwill then stop growing.  \n\nThe cloud has broken off of part of the greater \n<a href=\"ap010617.html\">Carina Nebula</a>, \na star forming region about 8000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> away.  \n\nNewly formed stars are <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2000/06/image/a\">visible</a> nearby, their images reddened by \nblue light being preferentially scattered by the pervasive \n<a href=\"ap010813.html\">dust</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2000/06/caption.html\">unusually-colored image</a> spans about two \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/question94.htm\">light years</a> and was taken by the orbiting \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 1999.  \n\nThis <a href=\"ap010717.html\">Carina</a> \nsub-cloud is particularly striking partly because its clear \ndefinition stimulates the human imagination \n(e.g. it could be perceived as a superhero flying \nthrough a cloud, arm up, with a saved person in tow \nbelow).",
