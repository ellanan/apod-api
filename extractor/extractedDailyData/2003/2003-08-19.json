  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow does Mars appear through a small telescope?  \n\nViewed with the unaided \n<a href=\"http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/V/Vision.html\">eye</a> or through a small <a href=\"http://van.hep.uiuc.edu/van/qa/section/Light_and_Sound/Telescopes_Binoculars_Cameras/20010329041649.htm\">telescope</a>, possibly the most striking part of \n<a href=\"http://athena.cornell.edu/kids/tommy_tt_issue2.html\">Mars' appearance</a> is its red color.  \n\nThe color derives from \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/question445.htm\">rust</a>, iron oxide, which composes perhaps 10% of the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad03mar99_1.htm\">Martian soil</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/8.html\">oxygen</a> that rusts the surface iron on Mars originates \npredominantly from \n<a href=\"http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/CO2/CO2.html\">carbon dioxide</a> gas, which composes 95% of the \n<a href=\"http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/index.cfm?pid=1057\">Martian atmosphere</a>.  \n\nMars nears its <a href=\"http://planetary.org/marswatch2003/observe.html\">closest approach</a> with Earth in nearly 60 millennia on August 27, \nthe red planet continues to appear larger, \nbrighter, and a good target for \n<a href=\"ap020813.html\">sky enthusiasts</a>.  \n\nPictured above, \n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a> was captured from the \n<a href=\"http://www.red2000.com/spain/canarias/\">Canary Islands</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sp.html\">Spain</a> during three days in three different orientations \nearlier this month.  \n\nVisible through the small telescope are white \n<a href=\"ap021224.html\">polar caps</a> of water and carbon-dioxide ice, \nlight red areas rich in lightly colored craters, and dark red \n<a href=\"ap010628.html\">areas</a> dominated by relatively smooth lowlands.",
