  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSome 2,000 light-years across, NGC 1705 is small as galaxies go,\nsimilar to our Milky Way's own satellite galaxies,\n<a href=\"ap980203.html\">the Magellanic Clouds</a>.\n\nAt a much larger distance of 17 million light-years, the\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/07/image/a\">stars\nof NGC 1705</a> are still easily resolved in\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2003/07/big.html\">this beautiful image</a>\nconstructed from data taken in 1999 and 2000 with the Hubble Space\nTelescope.\n\nMost of the younger, <a href=\"ap961202.html\">hot, blue</a>\nstars in the galaxy are\nseen to be concentrated in a large central star cluster with the\n<a href=\"ap010223.html\">older, cooler</a>,\nred stars more evenly distributed.\n\nPossibly 13 billion years old,\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/07/\nfastfacts\">NGC 1705</a> could well have been\nforming stars through out its lifetime while light from its most recent\nburst of star formation reached Earth only 30 million years ago.\n\nThis gradually evolving dwarf irregular galaxy\nlacks\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/1996/29/\nastrofile#2\">organized</a> structures like spiral arms and\nis thought to\nbe a nearby analog to the\n<a href=\"http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/early.html\">first\ngalaxies</a> to form\nin the <a href=\"ap030212.html\">early Universe</a>.",
