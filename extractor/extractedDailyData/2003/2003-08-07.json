  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture?\n\nThe summer night sky is clear, and\nmoonlight illuminates the dome of the\n<a href=\"http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/butowsky5/\nastro4e.htm\">Hale 200-inch Telescope</a> at\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomarpublic/\">Palomar Observatory</a>,\nnortheast of San Diego, California, USA.\n\nThe familiar stars of the\n<a href=\"http://www.earthsky.com/Features/\nSkywatching/swg030225-n.html\">Teapot asterism</a> in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sgr/\">Sagittarius</a>\nshine above the dome and to the right.\n\nIn fact, the only thing wrong with the picture is that\nthe observatory dome's two massive shutters\nare closed tight ... on a clear night.\n\nThis extremely unusual situation is a precaution\nprompted by the presence of airborne ash and smoke from\n<a href=\"ap001121.html\">wildfires</a>\nin the area on July 17\nwhich could have damaged the\n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v30n2/aas192/abs/\nS001003.html\">historic</a> mirror's aluminum coating.\n\nAmateur astronomer Greg Redfern notes that this\nyear has been a particularly bad one for observatories and\nwildfires, with the\n<a href=\"http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~brian/press/\">Mt. Stromlo</a>\nAustralian Observatory\ndisaster and fires also threatening telescopes on \n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/telescopes/mtlemmon.html\">Mount\nLemmon</a> near Tucson, Arizona.",
