  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe <a href=\"ap020324.html\">Cat's Eye Nebula</a>\n(NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary\nnebulae <a href=\"ap011003.html\">in the sky</a>.\n\nIts haunting <a href=\"http://www.cybercom.net/~klb/\ntiger.html\">symmetries</a> are seen in the very central region\nof this stunning false-color picture, processed to reveal the\nenormous but extremely faint halo of gaseous material, over three\nlight-years across, which surrounds the brighter, \nfamiliar planetary nebula.\n\nMade with data from the\n<a href=\"http://www.not.iac.es/\">Nordic Optical Telescope</a>\n\nin the Canary Islands, the composite picture\nshows emission from\nnitrogen atoms as red and oxygen atoms as green and blue shades.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">Planetary\nnebulae</a> have long been appreciated as a final phase\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/teachers/lifecycles/\nstars.html\">in the life</a> of a sun-like star.\n\nOnly much more recently however, have some planetaries been\n<a href=\"http://www.ing.iac.es/~rcorradi/HALOES/\">found to have halos</a>\nlike this one, likely formed of material shrugged off during\nearlier active episodes in the star's evolution.\n\nWhile the <a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/\">planetary\nnebula phase</a> is thought to last for around 10,000 years,\nastronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions\nof this halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.",
