  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMars is heading for its \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/planets/article_985_1.asp\">closest encounter</a> with Earth in over 50,000 years.\n\nAlthough <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> and \n<a href=\"earth.html\">Earth</a> continue in their normal \n<a href=\"http://www.kidscosmos.org/kid-stuff/mars-oppositions.html\">orbits</a> around the <a href=\"ap030707.html\">Sun</a>, \nabout every two years Earth and Mars are on the same \npart of their orbit as seen from the Sun.  \n\nWhen <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/18jun_approachingmars.htm\">this happens</a> again in late August, \nMars will be almost as near to the Sun as it ever gets, \nwhile simultaneously Earth will be almost as far from the Sun as it ever gets.  \n\nThis means that now is a great time to \n<a href=\"http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/2003/2003-095.htm\">launch your space probe</a> to Mars.  \n\nAlternatively, these next few months are a great time to \n<a href=\"ap030331.html\">see a bright red Mars</a> from your backyard. \n\n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Mars</a> \nis so close that global features should be visible \neven through a small telescope.  \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance/article_110_1.asp\">Look for Mars</a> to rise about 11 pm and to remain the \nbrightest red object in the sky until sunrise.  \n\nMars will rise increasingly earlier until its closest approach in late August.  \n\nMars was <a href=\"http://astropics.com/vfire/ntviews.htm\">captured above</a> rising through the Arch Rock in\nValley of Fire State Park, Nevada, USA.",
