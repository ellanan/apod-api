  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy do many galaxies appear as \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/spir.html\">spirals</a>? \n\nA striking example is M101, \n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/HawaiianStarlight/AIOM/English/CFHT-Coelum-AIOM-Mar2003.html\">shown above</a>, whose relatively close distance of about 22 million light years allow it to be studied in some detail. \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997ApJ...481..169W\">Recent evidence</a> indicates that a \nclose gravitational interaction with a neighboring galaxy created \n<a href=\"http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/~danforth/spiral/\">waves of high mass</a> and condensed gas which \ncontinue to orbit the galaxy center. \n\n<a href=\"http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~ummccowa/density.htm\">These waves</a> compress existing gas and cause star formation. \n\nOne result is that \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m101.html\">M101</a>, also called the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/m101.html\">Pinwheel Galaxy</a>, has several extremely \n<a href=\"ap000610.html\">bright star-forming regions</a> \n(called <a href=\"http://skyserver.fnal.gov/en/proj/challenges/hii/\">HII regions</a>) spread across its spiral arms. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/m101b.html\">M101</a> is so large that its \nimmense gravity distorts smaller nearby galaxies.",
