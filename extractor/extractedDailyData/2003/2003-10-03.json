  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhile this may not be the most esthetic image of\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/001p.html\">Comet Halley</a>\nthat you have ever seen, it is likely the most unique.\n\nThe tiny cluster of pixels circled is the\n<a href=\"http://www.skymapper.co.uk/html/comet_trivia.html\">famous\ncomet</a> along its orbit over\n4 billion (4,000,000,000) kilometers or 28\n<a href=\"http://einstein.stcloudstate.edu/Dome/clicks/au.html\">AU</a>\nfrom the Sun --\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/\nphot-27-03.html\">a record distance</a> for a comet observation.\n\nIts last passage through\n<a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/artsednet/resources/Space/Stories/\nhalleys.html\">our neck of the woods</a> in 1986,\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/comets/\nhalley.html\">Comet Halley</a>\npresently cruises through the dim reaches of the outer solar\nsystem, almost as far away as outermost gas giant Neptune, and shows no\nsign <a href=\"ap000805.html\">of activity</a>.\n\nCaptured in March, this negative image is a composite of\ndigital exposures made with three\nof ESO's <a href=\"ap000707.html\">Very Large Telescopes</a>.\n\nThe exposures are registered on the\n<a href=\"ap960626.html\">moving comet</a>, so the\npicture shows background stars and galaxies as elongated smudges.\n\nAn earth-orbiting satellite appears as a dark streak at the top.\n\n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/tnp/halley.html\">Comet\nHalley</a> is clearly extremely faint here, but large earthbound\ntelescopes will be able to \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast17oct_1.htm\">follow\nit</a> as it grows fainter still, reaching\nthe most distant point in its orbit, more than 5 billion kilometers\n(35 AU) from the Sun, in 2023.",
