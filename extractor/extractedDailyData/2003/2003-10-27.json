  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTwo unusually large \n<a href=\"ap011108.html\">sunspot</a> groups are now \ncrossing the face of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a>.  \n\nEach group, roughly the size of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>, is unusual not only for its size but \nbecause it is appearing over three years after \n<a href=\"ap010411.html\">solar maximum</a>, \nthe peak of solar surface activity.  \n\n<a href=\"ap020801.html\">Sunspot</a> group 10484 appears near the \nimage center, while <a href=\"ap981005.html\">sunspot</a> group 10486 is just coming over the left limb of the Sun.  \n\nThe active region associated with Sunspot 484 (the shorter nickname) \nhas already jettisoned a large \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/cmes.htm\">coronal mass ejection</a> (CME) of \n<a href=\"http://www.chem4kids.com/files/atom_ions.html\">particles</a> out into the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nWhen striking Earth, radiation of this sort has the power to interrupt normal \n<a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/satellite.htm\">satellite</a> operations while simultaneously providing \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?aurora\">beautiful auroras</a>. \n\nRotating with the Sun, \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/sun/article_1084_1.asp\">sunspots 484 and 486</a> will take about 30 days to make one \n<a href=\"http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/sun/rotation.shtml\">complete circle</a>, slowly evolving in size and shape during this time.  \n\nAfter using extreme care \n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/safety.html\">never to look directly at the Sun</a>, the above image \nwas created by holding a digital camera up to a small telescope.",
