  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is Phobos so dark?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/phobos.html\">Phobos</a>, the largest and innermost of two\nMartian moons, is the darkest moon in the entire \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>.  \n\nIts unusual orbit and color indicate that it may be a captured \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/asteroidfact.html\">asteroid</a> composed of a mixture of ice and dark rock.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2003/06/23/index.html\">above picture</a> was captured recently by the robot spacecraft \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/overview.html\">Mars Global Surveyor</a> (MGS) orbiting Mars.  \n\n<a href=\"ap030406.html\">Phobos</a> is a heavily \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">cratered</a> and \n<a href=\"ap001209.html\">barren</a> moon, with \nits largest crater located on the far side.  \n\nFrom MGS images like this, \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/phobos.htm\">Phobos</a> has been determined to be covered by perhaps a meter of \n<a href=\"ap980914.html\">loose dust</a>.  \n\nPhobos <a href=\"ap030329.html\">orbits</a> so close to \nMars that from some places it would appear to rise and \nset twice a day, but from other places \nit would not be visible at all.  \n\n<a href=\"ap990313.html\">Phobos</a>' orbit around Mars is \ncontinually decaying -- it will likely break up with pieces \ncrashing to the Martian surface in about 50 million years.",
