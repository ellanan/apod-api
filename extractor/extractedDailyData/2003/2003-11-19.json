  "title": "Light Can Twist as Well as Spin",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLight is more complicated than we thought.  \n\nWhen astronomers measure \n<a href=\"http://ethel.as.arizona.edu/~collins/astro/subjects/electromag6.html\">light</a>, they are usually concerned with its direction, energy, and \n<a href=\"http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s9-04/9-04.htm\">spin polarization</a> (sometimes).  \n\nRecently, however, it has been more broadly \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003ApJ...597.1266H\">realized</a> that photons can also have \n<a href=\"http://www.photonics.com/spectra/research/XQ/ASP/preaid.26/QX/read.htm\">orbital angular momentum</a> (OAM), \nan attribute classically analogous to the \nEarth orbiting the Sun as well as spinning on its axis.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/projects/singlePhotonOAM/\">Pictured above</a>, the wave-front of a photon with \nOAM is shown to be twisted, in contrast to the flat plane of zero OAM light.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/projects/AMAndTweezers/\">Light with OAM</a> might be used to increase the \ninformation content of communication or to discern \nspecific types of astronomical sources.\n\nPassing through a common lens, light without OAM focuses to a point, \nwhereas <a href=\"http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st29\">light with OAM</a> focuses to a ring. \n\nMost light bouncing around the cosmos, \nhowever, is expected to have so little (or zero) \nOAM that the created ring is too small to measure.  \n\nEven given other <a href=\"http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/projects/singlePhotonOAM/\">promising methods for measurement</a>, exploiting OAM for \nastronomical discovery might be as much an issue of \nobservational practicality as theoretical possibility.",
