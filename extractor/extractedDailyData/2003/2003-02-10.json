  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/comets.html\">comet</a> \nmay likely become visible to the unaided eye over the \nnext few days above the \n<a href=\"ap021110.html\">horizon</a> where the Sun has just set.  \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_847_1.asp\">Comet NEAT (C/ 2002 V1)</a>, discovered last November, has \nbrightened dramatically as it approached the Sun. \n\nOver the next few days, the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2002V1_1.html\">quickly setting comet</a> could \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/icq/CometMags.html#2002V1\">appear</a> as bright as second \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a>.  \n\nOn February 18 it will round the Sun well within the <a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/glossary_level2/glossary_text.html#orbit\">orbit</a> of \n<a href=\"ap000320.html\">Mercury</a>.  \n\nDuring surrounding days, the Sun's glare will effectively \nhide the comet to human observers.  \n\nIt is quite probable, though, that \n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2002V1/2002V1.html\">Comet NEAT</a> will standout prominently in \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/latestimages.html\">images taken</a> by the Sun-looking \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/mission/\">SOHO satellite</a>.  \n\nPictured above, \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002v1.html\">Comet NEAT</a>'s complex and developing \n<a href=\"ap000413.html\">tail</a> was photographed on \nJanuary 29 (top) and February 2.  \n\n<a href=\"ap020813.html\">Sky enthusiasts</a> \nshould remember to never look directly at the Sun.",
