  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMars won't look this good.  \n\nTonight and over the next few days, when \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> is at its \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/marswatch2003/observe.html\">closest approach</a> to Earth in nearly 60,000 years, \nyou might get your \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/marswatch2003/\">best view ever</a> of our planetary neighbor.  \n\nPlease, though, don't expect to see \n<a href=\"ap030819.html\">this much structure</a>, \nor expect to see Mars rotate so much in so brief a period.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.astroshow.com/mars/ccdmars.html\">above 20-frame movie</a> was created from 1000 frames \nof a backyard webcam that were meticulously aligned, \nadded, and digitally sequenced.  \n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.astroshow.com/mars/ccdmars.html\">Pictured</a>, \nMars appears to rotate in a time-lapse sequence, \nwith each frame separated by 30 minutes of real time.  \n\nIn reality, one full Martian rotation -- \n<a href=\"ap970706.html\">a Martian day</a> -- \nis only about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day.  \n\nFor those with access to a small telescope, \n<a href=\"image/0308/mars3cr_anderson.gif\">here</a> \nis how mars will really look.",
