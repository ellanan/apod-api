  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhy do some places on Earth have higher gravity than others?  \n\nSometimes the reason is unknown.  To help better understand the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Interior_Structure/surface.html\">Earth's surface</a>, slight distance changes between a \npair of identically orbiting satellites named \n<a href=\" http://essp.gsfc.nasa.gov/grace/\">GRACE</a> \nhave been used to create the best ever map of Earth's\n<a href=\"http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/phys-sci/gravity/history/history.htm\">gravitational field</a>.  \n\nHigh points on \n<a href=\"http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace/gallery/animations/ggm01/\">this\nmap</a>, also colored red, indicate areas where gravity is \nslightly stronger than usual, while in blue areas gravity is\nslightly weaker.\n\nMany bumps and valleys on the map can be \nattributed to surface features, such as the \n<a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge\">North\nMid-Atlantic Ridge</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap020723.html\">Himalayan Mountains</a>, \nbut others cannot, and so might relate to unusually \nhigh or low sub-surface densities.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04652\">Maps\nlike this</a> also help calibrate changes in the \nEarth's surface including \n<a href=\"ap980113.html\">variable ocean currents</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap020527.html\">melting of glaciers</a>.",
