  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhen a \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/meteorites.html\">meteorite</a> strikes the \n<a href=\"moon.html\">Moon</a>, the energy of the impact melts some of the \n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/edu/micromet.htm\">splattering rock</a>, a fraction of which might cool into tiny \n<a href=\"ap010523.html\">glass beads</a>.  \n\nMany of these glass beads were present in <a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/tools/Welcome.html\">lunar soil samples</a> returned to Earth by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/apollo/\">Apollo missions</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/lunar-spherule.html\">Pictured above</a> is one such glass \n<a href=\"http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?spherule\">spherule</a> that measures only a quarter of a \n<a href=\"http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/everyday.htm\">millimeter</a> across.  \n\nThis spherule is particularly interesting because it \nhas been victim to an even smaller impact.  \n\nA miniature \n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">crater</a> is visible on the \nupper left, surrounded by a fragmented area caused by the\n<a href=\"ap010623.html\">shockwaves</a> of the small impact. \n\nBy dating many of these impacts, some \n<a href=\"http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/lunar-spherule.html\" \"=\"\">astronomers estimate</a> that \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">cratering</a> on our Moon \nincreased roughly 500 million years ago and continues even today.",
