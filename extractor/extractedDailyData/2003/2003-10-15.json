  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy didn't we see it?  \n\nAn <a href=\"http://www.lowell.edu/press_room/releases/recent_releases/2003_sq222_rls.html\">undetected asteroid</a> zipped past the \nEarth undetected last month in the \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/neo_ca?past=1\">closest near miss</a> yet recorded -- \nwithin a quarter of the distance to the Moon. \n\nSuch a <a href=\"ap990901.html\">close call</a> \nis actually quite common -- \nwhat was new was that we did see it, although the \ndetection occurred hours after it happened.\n\nIn fact, a rock this size strikes the Earth \nroughly once a year and smaller rocks \n<a href=\" ap020623.html\">strike the Earth daily</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/\">global danger</a> \nfrom the bus-sized space rock was minimal.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.minorplanetresearch.org/Staff.asp\">Robert Cash</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.minorplanetresearch.org/\">Minor Planet Research Inc.</a> discovered \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>  \n2003 SQ222 in data from the sky-scanning \n<a href=\"http://asteroid.lowell.edu/asteroid/loneos/loneos.html\">Lowell Observatory Near Earth Object Search</a> (LONEOS).\n\n<a href=\"http://asteroid.lowell.edu/asteroid/loneos/sq222.html\">Pictured above</a> is the discovery image sequence of SQ222, \nshown stretched vertically to be more easily viewable.\n\n<a href=\"ap020724.html\">Objects</a> like <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/html/news/articlearchive/headlines/2003/asteroid2003-sq222.html\">SQ222</a> are hard to \ndetect because they are \n<a href=\"ap990901.html\">so faint</a> and move \n<a href=\"ap011224.html\">so fast</a>.  \n\nAn ability to scan the sky to detect, catalog, \nand analyze such objects has been \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/NEO/TheNEOPage.html\">increasing notably</a> in \n<a href=\"ap021231.html\">recent years</a>.",
