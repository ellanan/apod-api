  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNot part of a television game series, the\n<a href=\"http://www.jhuapl.edu/public/pr/010228.htm\">NEAR Shoemaker\nspacecraft survived</a>\nits unprecedented landing on an\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a> last month.\n\nAs suggested in the\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20010209/index.html\">illustration\ninset above</a>, the car-sized probe\nlikely rests gently on the tips of its solar panels\nhaving touched down under the\ninfluence of asteroid Eros' feeble gravity.\n\nFortunately, the spacecraft's solar panels were bathed in sunlight and\nable to power\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/instruments/\nXGRS/index.html\">NEAR's gamma-ray spectrometer</a>.\n\nPerched on the asteroid, this instrument can determine the composition\nof Eros to a depth of about 10 centimeters\nwith unanticipated accuracy\nby measuring\n<a href=\"http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast27feb_2.htm\">the\ngamma-ray signatures</a> of the atomic nuclei present.\n\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/iod/20010301/\">The data\nreturned</a> from the surface of Eros are plotted above\nand show clearly features corresponding to Iron, Oxygen, Silicon, and\nPotassium in the asteroid's <a href=\"ap000829.html\">regolith</a>.\n\nAlso briefly operating on Eros,\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/instruments/MAG/index.html\">NEAR's magnetometer</a> has indicated that no surface \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wmfield.html\">magnetic field</a> is discernible.  \n\n<a href=\"http://near.jhuapl.edu/NEAR/Reports/WeeklyStatus/\n2001-03-02.txt\">Now turned off</a>, NEAR Shoemaker could remain preserved\nin its present location, the vicinity of the huge, saddle-shaped feature\ndubbed <a href=\"ap001026.html\">Himeros</a>, for billions of years.\n\nBut, as the\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/\nast21jun_1_ada.htm\">asteroid orbits</a>, the spacecraft's solar panels\nwill be repeatedly turned toward the Sun ... offering the possibility\nof reawakening <a href=\"ap010213.html\">this survivor</a>.",
