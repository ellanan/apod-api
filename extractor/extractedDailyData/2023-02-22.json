  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOur Sun is becoming a busy place. \n\nOnly two years ago, the Sun was emerging from a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_minimum\">solar minimum</a> \nso quiet that \n<a href=\"ap190306.html\">month</a>s would go by \n<a href=\"ap190715.html\">without</a> even a single \n<a href=\"ap150629.html\">sunspot</a>. \n\nIn contrast, already this year and well ahead of schedule, our Sun is \n<a href=\"https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2023/02/04/sunspot-counts-hit-their-highest-level-in-9-years/\">unusually active</a>, already nearing solar activity levels seen a decade ago during the last \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum\">solar maximum</a>. \n\nOur increasingly active Sun was captured two weeks ago sporting numerous \n<a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*Bp1dNLfyDjH2QCgALi-BrQ.jpeg\">interesting</a> features.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=745237160282433&amp;set=a.220016599471161\">The image</a> was recorded in a single color of light called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">Hydrogen Alpha</a>, \ncolor-inverted, and false colored. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/scientists-uncover-origins-of-the-sun-s-swirling-spicules\">Spicules</a> \ncarpet much of the Sun's face. \n\nThe brightening towards the Sun's edges is caused by \nincreased absorption of relatively cool solar gas and called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_darkening\">limb darkening</a>. \n\nJust <a href=\"ap220302.html\">outside the Sun's disk</a>, \nseveral scintillating \n<a href=\"ap150125.html\">prominences protrude</a>, \nwhile prominences on the Sun's face are known as \n<a href=\"ap220913.html\">filaments</a> and show as light streaks. \n\nMagnetically tangled \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/sdo-shows-active-regions-across-front-of-sun\">active regions</a> are both dark and light and contain cool \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/\">sunspots</a>. \n\nAs our \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/suns-magnetic-field-portrayed\">Sun's magnetic field</a> winds toward solar maximum over the next few years, \nwhether the \n<a href=\"https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2023/02/04/sunspot-counts-hit-their-highest-level-in-9-years/\">Sun's high activity</a> will continue to increase is unknown.",
