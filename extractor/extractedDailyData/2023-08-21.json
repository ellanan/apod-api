  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWill Comet Nishimura become visible to the unaided eye?\n\nGiven the unpredictability of comets, no one can say for sure, \nbut it currently seems like a good bet. \n\nThe comet was \n<a href=\"http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/005200/CBET005285.txt\">discovered</a> only ten days ago by Hideo Nishimura \nduring 30-second exposures with a standard digital camera. \n\nSince then, \n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/162802/comet-p1-nishimura-could-be-bright-over-the-next-few-weeks/\">C/2023 P1 Nishimura</a> has increased in brightness and \nits path across the inner \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> determined. \n\nAs the comet dives toward the Sun, it will surely continue to \n<a href=\"http://aerith.net/comet/catalog/2023P1/2023P1.html\">intensify and possibly become</a> a naked-eye object in early September. \n\nA problem is that \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/new-comet-c-2023-p1-nishimura-bright-august-september-october-2023/\">the comet</a> will also be angularly near the Sun, \nso it will only be possible to see it \n<a href=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MnQVQct8L._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg\">near sunset or sunrise</a>. \n\nThe comet will get so \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=700742702067209&amp;set=a.419550426853106\">close to the Sun</a> -- inside the orbit of \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-mercury/\">planet Mercury</a> -- \nthat its nucleus may \n<a href=\"ap200416.html\">break up</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/t57un4/B/\">Pictured</a>, \nComet Nishimura was imaged three days ago from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/upj8BRfn0yU\">June Lake</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> \nwhile sporting a green coma and a thin tail.",
