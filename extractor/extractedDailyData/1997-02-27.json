  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: What's that fuzzy star?  It's not a star, it's <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/HaleBopp.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>.\n Not only has <a href=\"ap970212.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> become\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/comets/hb13.html\">easy to see in the morning sky</a>,\nit has become hard <i>not</i> to see it.  It's that bright.  Any\nmorning just before sunrise, <a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/comets/gifs/hbfeb97.gif\">look towards the east</a>.\n <a href=\"http://www.kalmbach.com/astro/comet/comet.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>\nis one of the brightest objects up.  Its dominating presence\nis shown dramatically by this photo taken just west of Williston,\n<a href=\"http://www.ipass.net/~kestep/nclink.htm\">North Carolina</a>,\n<a href=\"ap960617.html\">USA</a>.  Here <a href=\"ap970220.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>\nshines above the telephone poles lining Highway 70.  Too tired\nto get up in the morning to see the comet?  Don't worry, in less\nthan a month it will also be visible in the evening sky, just\nbefore sunset.  And it will have a <a href=\"ap960502.html\">longer tail</a>.\n\nFrom the Space Shuttle, Dr. Steven Hawley says,\n<a href=\"http://shuttle.nasa.gov/sts-82/video/daily/Flightday10/bopp.html\">\"Hale-Bopp looks great.\"</a>",
