  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWell over a thousand galaxies are known members of\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/virgo.html\">the Virgo Cluster</a>,\nthe closest large cluster of galaxies to our own\n<a href=\"ap991114.html\">local group</a>.\n\nThe galaxy cluster is difficult\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/virgo_gal.html\">to see</a>\nall at once because\nit covers such a large area\n<a href=\"http://people.ne.mediaone.net/mbendaniel/gallery/astro/\nindex.html\">on the sky</a>.\n\nStill,\n<a href=\"http://people.ne.mediaone.net/mbendaniel/gallery/astro/\nvirgo_cluster.html\">this excellent\ntelescopic view</a> records the region of the\nVirgo Cluster around its dominant giant elliptical\n<a href=\"ap990216.html\">galaxy M87</a>.\n\nM87 can be seen as a fuzzy patch near the picture's bottom center.\n\nIn fact, a close examination of the image will\nreveal that many of the \"stars\" are\nactually surrounded by a telltale fuzz, indicating\nthat they are\n<a href=\"http://www.limber.org/cruise.html\">Virgo Cluster galaxies</a>.\n\nHow many galaxies can you pick out?\n\nClick on the image for an uncropped, labeled version which includes the\n<a href=\"http://www.ngcic.org/\">NGC catalog</a>\nnumbers for most of the visible galaxies.\n\nOn average,\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/virgo/\nindex.html\">Virgo Cluster</a> galaxies are measured to be\nabout 48 million light-years away.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-iarticle_query?1996PASP%2E%2E108%2E1091V\">The Virgo\nCluster distance</a> has been used to give an important\ndetermination of the Hubble Constant and\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/\ndebate96.html\">the scale of the Universe</a>.",
