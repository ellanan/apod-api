  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap951027.html\">Stars with tens of times the mass</a> of the Sun profoundly affect\ntheir galactic environment.\n\nChurning and mixing the interstellar\ngas and dust clouds\n<a href=\"ap960509.html\">they leave their mark</a> in the compositions\nand locations of future generations of stars and star systems.\n\nDramatic evidence of this is beautifully illustrated\nin our neighboring galaxy,\n<a href=\"ap980124.html\">the Large Magellanic Cloud</a> (LMC),\nby the lovely ring shaped nebula,\n<a href=\"http://spacsun.rice.edu/~henize/karlhenize.html\">Henize</a> 70.\n\nIt is actually\n<a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/dfm/aat033.html\">a luminous \"superbubble\" </a>\nof interstellar gas about 300 lightyears in diameter, blown by\n<a href=\"ap970928.html\">winds from massive stars</a> and\n<a href=\"http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova explosions</a>,\nits interior filled with tenuous\nhot expanding gas.\n\nThese superbubbles offer astronomers a\n<a href=\"ap980502.html\">chance to explore</a>\nthis crucial connection between the\nlifecycles of stars and the evolution of galaxies.",
