  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nOpen clusters of stars can be near or far, young or old, \nand diffuse or compact.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html\">Found near the plane</a> \nof our Milky Way galaxy, they\ncontain from 100 to 10,000 stars, all of which formed at \nnearly the same time.  \n\n<a href=\"ap021201.html\">Bright blue stars</a> frequently \ndistinguish younger open clusters.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m035.html\">M35</a>, \non the upper left, is relatively nearby at 2800\n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/\nquestion19.html\">light years</a> distant, relatively young at 150 million years old, and relatively diffuse, with about 2500 stars spread out over a \nvolume 30 light years across.  \n\nAn older and more compact open cluster, \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/MWGC/n2158.html\">NGC 2158</a>,\nis at the lower right.  \n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0202018\">NGC 2158</a> is four times\nmore distant than\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011136\">M35</a>,\nover 10 times older, and much more compact with many \nmore stars in roughly the same volume of space.  \n\nNGC 2158's bright blue stars have \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">self-destructed</a>, \nleaving cluster light to be dominated by \nolder and yellower stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://astro-cabinet.com/\nshowimage.php?image=M35-3_3m-RGB_final.jpg&amp;lang=english#\">Both\nclusters are seen</a> toward the constellation of\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/\nconstellations/Gemini.html\">Gemini</a>.",
