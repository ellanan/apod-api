  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nEugenia is an\n<a href=\"http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~merline/press_release/\">asteroid with a moon</a>!\n\nThis animation was constructed from infrared discovery images of the\nEugenia-moon system taken in November 1998 using the\n<a href=\"http://cfht.hawaii.edu/CFHT/Tour/\">Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope</a> (CFHT).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">Main belt asteroid</a> Eugenia, represented here as a central white patch,\nis a mere 215 kilometers in diameter.\n\nIts moon, seen at 5 separate positions around a clockwise orbit,\nis estimated to be 13 kilometers wide.\n\n<a href=\"http://cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/AOB/\">An adaptive optics system</a> was used with the CFHT,\nlocated atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii, \nto counteract the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere making possible\n<a href=\"http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~merline/press_release/press_release.txt\">this premier discovery</a> from a ground-based\ntelescope.\n\nOnly one\n<a href=\"ap990807.html\">other asteroid-moon system</a> is known.\n\nDactyl, moon of the asteroid Ida, was discovered by the\nGalileo spacecraft during a 1993 flyby.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nEugenia's moon has a nearly circular orbit with a radius of\n1,190 kilometers which it completes once in 4.7 days.\n\nThe orbit appears oval-shaped because it is tilted\nat a 45 degree angle to the line-of-sight.\n\nKnowing the moon's orbit allows astronomers\n<a href=\"http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/kepler_binary.htm\">to calculate</a> the asteroid's mass.\n\nCombining mass and size determines the asteroid's density,\nwhich in this case gives a surprising result -\nEugenia is found to have a density only 20% greater than water.\n\nThe low density suggests that Eugenia itself is a porous \"rubble pile\"\nof rocks or composed mostly of water-ice with only a little\nadditional rocky material.",
