  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you could look at Venus with radar eyes - \nthis is what you might see.\n\nThis computer reconstruction of the surface of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/venus.html\">Venus</a> was created from data from the \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/magellan.html\">Magellan spacecraft</a>.  \n\nMagellan orbited \n<a href=\"ap970507.html\">Venus</a> \nand used radar to map our \n<a href=\"venus.html\">neighboring planet</a>'s \nsurface between 1990 and 1994.\n\nMagellan found many interesting surface features, \nincluding the \n<a href=\"ap980120.html\">large circular domes</a>, \ntypically 25-kilometers across, that are <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/mgn_alpha_regio.txt\">depicted above</a>.  \n\nVolcanism is thought to have created the domes, although the \nprecise mechanism remains unknown. \n<a href=\" http://www.solarviews.com/eng/venus.htm\">Venus</a>' \nsurface is so hot and hostile that no \n<a href=\"ap990124.html\">surface probe</a> \nhas lasted more than a few minutes.",
