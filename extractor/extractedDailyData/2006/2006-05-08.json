  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nYou're the first spacecraft ever to descend to Titan -- what do you see?\n\nImmediately after the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_probe\">Huygen's probe</a> \npierced the cloud deck of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_%28planet%29\">Saturn</a>'s moon \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?titan\">Titan</a> \nlast January, it took a unique series of  pictures of one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/our_solar_system/solar_system.html\">Solar System</a>'s most mysterious moon's.  \n\nThose pictures have recently been digitally stitched together to create \nspectacular panoramas and a dramatic \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08117\">descent movie</a>.   \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08114\">Pictured above</a> \nis a panoramic fisheye view Huygen's obtained from about five kilometers above \n<a href=\"ap050117.html\">Titan's surface</a>.  \n\nThe digital projection makes the local surface, mostly flat, appear as a ball, \nbut allows one to see in all directions.   \n\n\nHuygen's eventual \n<a href=\"ap050518.html\">landing site</a> \nwas in the large dark area below, just right of the center.\n\nThis relatively featureless, dark, sandy basin appears to be surrounded by \nlight colored hills to the right and a landscape fractured by \n<a href=\"ap050124.html\">streambeds and canyons</a> above.    \n\n<a href=\"http://uanews.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews.woa/16/wa/MainStoryDetails?ArticleID=12614\">Recent evidence</a> indicates that Titan's lakebeds and \nstreambeds are usually dry but sometimes filled with a flashflood of liquid \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> from rare torrents of \n<a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1413.html\">methane rain</a>.",
