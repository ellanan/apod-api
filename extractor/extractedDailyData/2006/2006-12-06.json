  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you have the right equipment, you can see the Spirit rover currently rolling across Mars.  \n\nThe right equipment, however, is currently limited to the \n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/\">High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment</a> \nonboard the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (MRO).  \n\nMRO arrived at \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> \nin March and just started science observations of the red planet last month.   \n\nVisible in the <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01879\">above spectacularly high resolution image</a> is the \n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">Spirit rover</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap040628.html\">Columbia Hills</a> of Mars.  \n\nObjects as small as one meter are resolved.   \n\nAlso visible are the tracks made by the \nrobot explorer and a large plateau of layered rock dubbed <a href=\"http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/Home_Plate_Continues_To_Mystify_Mars_Rover_Team.html\">Home Plate</a>.   \n\nMRO will continue to image the \n<a href=\"ap980608.html\">red planet</a> in unprecedented detail, \ncreating images that will likely be important in better understanding the \ngeology and weather on Mars, \nas well as indicating good candidate landing sites for \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/future/msl.html\">future missions</a> to Mars.",
