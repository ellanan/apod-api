  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat is it? \n\nIt was found at the bottom of the sea aboard an ancient Greek ship.  \n\nIts seeming complexity has prompted decades of study, although many of its functions remained unknown.  \n\nRecent \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/xrays.html\">X-rays</a> of the device have now confirmed the nature of the \n<a href=\"http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_4.htm\">Antikythera mechanism</a>, \nand discovered several surprising functions.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_Mechanism\">Antikythera mechanism</a>\nhas been discovered to be a mechanical computer of an accuracy thought impossible in 80 BC, when the ship that carried it sunk.   \n\nSuch sophisticated technology was not thought to be developed by humanity for another 1,000 years.\n\nIts wheels and gears create a portable \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery\">orrery</a> of the sky \nthat predicted star and planet locations as well as \n<a href=\"ap040525.html\">lunar</a> and \n<a href=\"ap030530.html\">solar eclipse</a>s.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20061202/fob6.asp\">Antikythera \nmechanism</a>, \n<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:NAMA_Machine_d%27Anticyth%C3%A8re_1.jpg\">shown above</a>, is 33 centimeters high and similar in size to a large book.",
