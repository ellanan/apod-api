  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNear picture center, the helmet-shaped structure with\nwing-like appendages is popularly called\n<a href=\"ap051119.html\">Thor's Helmet</a>.\n\nCataloged as NGC 2359, the striking nebula is located about\n15,000 light-years away in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.internal.org/view_poem.phtml?poemID=115\">Canis\nMajor</a>.\n\nThe helmet is actually more like\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/n2359.html\">a\ncosmic bubble</a>, blown as the\nwind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center sweeps\nthrough the surrounding molecular cloud.\n\nKnown as a\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/\n980603a.html\">Wolf-Rayet star</a>, the energetic star is a blue giant\nthought to be in a brief,\npre-<a href=\"ap050910.html\">supernova</a> stage of evolution.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://dg-imaging.astrodon.com/gallery/\ndisplay.cfm?imgID=38\">remarkable color composite</a>\ncombines broad and narrow band images -\nincluding a deep exposure recorded with an\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha\">H-alpha filter</a>.\n\nThe H-alpha image <a href=\"ap051223.html\">traces</a> the light from\nthe region's glowing atomic hydrogen gas.\n\nHeroically sized even for a\n<a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/t/thor.html\">Norse god</a>,\nthis Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across.",
