  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's creating light-toned deposits on Mars?   \n\nQuite possibly -- water!  \n\nImages of the same parts of \n<a href=\"ap010628.html\">mid-latitude Mars</a> taken over the years but \n<a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2006/12/06/gullies/sirenum_crater/index.html\">released</a> only last week have shown unexpected new light-toned deposits \nwhere there were none before. \n\nOne clear case is \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09028\">shown above</a>, \nwhere the same crater on Mars is shown as photographed in 1999 August and again in 2005 September.  \n\nThe unusual deposit is visible only on the more recent photograph.\n\nApparent tributaries near the bottom bolster the \n<a href=\"http://planetary.org/blog/article/00000789/\">leading hypothesis</a> \nthat water gushed out of the crater wall, flowed down the crater, \nand soon evaporated into the thin \n<a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Marsatmos.html\">Martian atmosphere</a>.  \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"ap050720.html\">frozen water-ice</a> has been known near the \n<a href=\"ap981216.html\">Martian poles</a> for years, \nfree flowing surface water like this was not expected to be seen in the mid-latitudes of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a>.\n\nIf confirmed, such water springs might make more of \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/science/life/\">Mars hospitable to life</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/main/index.html\">human visitation</a> than previously believed.",
