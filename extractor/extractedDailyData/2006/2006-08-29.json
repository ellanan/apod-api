  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt's the blue wisp near the bottom that's the remnant of a tremendous recent supernova explosion.  \n\nThe large pink structure looming to the upper right is part of N76, a large \n<a href=\"stellar_nurseries.html\">star forming region</a> in our neighboring \n<a href=\"ap050617.html\">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> (SMC) galaxy.   \n\nThe supernova remnant wisp, with full coordinate name 1E0102.2-7219 and frequently abbreviated as <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/35/index.html\">E0102</a>, \nalso lies in the SMC, about 50 light years away from N76.    \n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/35/image/a\">above image</a> is a composite of several images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.  \n\n<a href=\"ap000414.html\">E0102</a> is of research interest \nbecause we see it as it appeared only 2,000 years after its explosion.  \n\nExamination of E0102 therefore gives clues about how an \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">enigmatic supernova</a> \nworks and what materials it dispersed into the surrounding \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/milkyway/ism.html\">interstellar medium</a>.",
