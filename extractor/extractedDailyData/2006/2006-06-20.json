  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs this a picture of a sunset from Earth's North Pole?  \n\nRegardless of \n<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/northpole.asp\">urban legends</a> circulating the Internet, the answer is no.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.inganielsen.de.tc/\">above scene</a> \nwas drawn to be an imaginary celestial place that would be calm and peaceful, \nand therefore titled Hideaway.\n\nThe scene could not exist anywhere on the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a> because from the Earth, the \n<a href=\"moon.html\">Moon</a> and the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Sun</a> always have nearly the same \n<a href=\"http://www.1728.org/angsize.htm\">angular size</a>.  \n\nThis is particularly apparent, for example, during \n<a href=\"ap020610.html\">solar eclipses</a>.  \n\nStill, the scene drawn is quite striking, and the crescent part of the \"moon\" \nshown is approximately accurate given the location of the parent star.  \n\nIn reality, the \n<a href=\"ap040919.html\">North Pole</a> of Earth \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Noaa3-2006-0602-1206.jpg\">looks different</a>.  \n\nStarting earlier this month, the North Pole even has a \n<a href=\"http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/gallery_np.html\">web camera</a> returning near-live pictures.",
