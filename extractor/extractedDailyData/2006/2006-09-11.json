  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLast Thursday, part of our Moon turned dark.  \n\nThe cause, this time, was not a partial \n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">lunar phase</a> -- the Moon was full -- \nbut rather that part of the Moon went into Earth's shadow.  \n\nThe resulting partial \n<a href=\"ap041103.html\">lunar eclipse</a> was visible from the eastern \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zh.html\">Atlantic Ocean</a> \nthrough \n<a href=\"ap051207.html\">Europe</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia\">Asia</a> and into the western \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zn.html\">Pacific Ocean</a>.  \n\nThe darkest part of the \n<a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2006Sep07P.GIF\">lunar eclipse</a>, when part of the Moon was completely \n<a href=\"ap060909.html\">shielded from sunlight</a>, \nlasted about 90 minutes.\n\nPictured above, a partially eclipsed Moon is seen rising over an estate in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29\">Huddersfield</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles_%28terminology%29\">England</a>.  \n\nThe above image was taken far away from the house in the foreground, \nas only this would allow it to appear as angularly small as the \n<a href=\"ap031011.html\">half-degree Moon</a> far in the background.   \n\nA setting twilight Sun lit the foreground.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://mreclipse.com/Special/LEnext.html\">next eclipse</a> \nof the Moon will occur in March 2007.",
