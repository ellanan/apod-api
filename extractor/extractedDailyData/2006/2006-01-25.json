  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan you find supernova 1987A?  \n\nIt isn't hard -- it occurred at the center of the expanding \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullseye\">bullseye</a> pattern.  \n\nAlthough this stellar detonation was first seen almost two decades ago, \nlight from it continues to bounce off clumps of \n<a href=\"ap050521.html\">interstellar dust</a> \nand be reflected to us today.  \n\nThese expanding \n<a href=\"ap971023.html\">light echoes</a> \nhave been recorded in the \n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/supermacho/lightechos/index.html\">above time-lapse movie</a> recorded over four years from the \n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/telescopes/4m/base4m.html\">Blanco 4-meter telescope</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ci.html\">Chile</a>.  \n\nThe first image is an image of the \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/sn1987anino.html\">SN 1987A</a> region, \nwhile the next four images were created by subtracting consecutive images, \ntaken a year apart, and leaving only the difference between the images.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/supermacho/lightechos/What/what.html\">Light echoes</a> can be seen moving out from the position of the supernova.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ctio.noao.edu/supermacho/lightechos/SM/sm.html\">SuperMACHO</a> team who recorded the \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr05/pr0512.html\">above light echoes</a> around \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A\">supernova 1987A</a> \nhas also found faint and previously unnoticed \n<a href=\"ap051127.html\">light echoes</a> from two other \n<a href=\"ap000222.html\">LMC</a> supernovas.  \n\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510738\">Study</a> of these light echoes \nhas enabled more accurate determinations of the location and date of these two \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">supernova explosions</a> \nthat were first visible hundreds of years ago.",
