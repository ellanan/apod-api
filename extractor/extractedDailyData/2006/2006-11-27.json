  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes the mysterious spokes in Saturn's rings? \n\nVisible on the left of the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08316\">above image</a> \nas ghostlike impressions, spokes were first discovered by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1\">Voyager spacecraft</a> \nthat buzzed by Saturn in the early 1980s.  \n\nTheir existence was unexpected, and no genesis hypothesis has ever become accepted.  \n\nOddly, the <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html\">spokes</a> were conspicuously \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005DPS....37.6111M\">absent</a> from initial images sent back by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> \nnow orbiting Saturn.  \n\nAnalyses of archived \n<a href=\"ap020831.html\">Voyager</a> images have led to the \nconclusions that the transient spokes, which may form and dissipate over a few hours, are composed of electrically charged sheets of small dust-sized particles.\n\nSome recent images from Cassini like that \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08316\">shown above</a> \nhave now finally shown the enigmatic spokes superposed on \n<a href=\"ap050525.html\">Saturn's B ring</a>.  \n\n\nHypotheses for spoke creation include small meteors impacting the rings and \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006GeoRL..3321202J\">electron beams</a> from Saturnian atmospheric \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061120/full/061120-14.html\">lightning \nspraying</a> the rings.  \n\nObservations of the puzzling spokes, as well as creative origin speculations, are ongoing.",
