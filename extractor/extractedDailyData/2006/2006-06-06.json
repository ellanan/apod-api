  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did a star form this beautiful nebula?  \n\nIn the middle of \n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebula</a> \nNGC 6164-5 is an unusually massive star nearing the end of its life.  \n\nThe star, visible in the center of the \n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/dualneb\">above image</a> and catalogued as HD 148937, \nis so hot that the <a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/uv.html\">ultraviolet light</a> \nit emits heats up gas that surrounds it.  \n\nThat gas was likely thrown off from the star, possibly by its fast rotation, like a \n<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/S8684E/s8684e05.jpg\">rotating lawn sprinkler</a>.  \n\nExpelled material might have been further channeled by the \n<a href=\"ap980629.html\">magnetic field</a> of the star, creating the \n<a href=\"ap060326.html\">symmetric shape</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap030113.html\">bipolar nebula</a>.  \n\nSeveral <a href=\"ap960416.html\">cometary knots</a> of gas are also visible on the lower left.\n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1985PASP...97..780F&amp;\">NGC 6164-5</a> spans about four \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_years\">light years</a> \nand is located about 4,000 light years away toward the southern constellation \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/norma.html\">Norma</a>.",
