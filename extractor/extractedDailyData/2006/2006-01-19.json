  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFew cosmic vistas excite the imagination like\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m042.html\">the Orion Nebula</a>.\n\nAlso known as\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/Mdes/dm042.html\">M42</a>,\nthe nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an\nimmense interstellar molecular cloud only 1,500 light-years away.\n\nThe Orion Nebula offers one of the best opportunities\nto study how stars are born partly because it is the nearest large\nstar-forming region, but also because the nebula's\n<a href=\"ap050710.html\">energetic stars</a> have\n<a href=\"http://vis.sdsc.edu/research/orion.html\">blown away</a>\nobscuring gas and dust clouds that\nwould otherwise block\n<a href=\"http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/news/archive/2006/01/\nphoto-02.php\">our view</a> - providing an intimate look at a\nrange of ongoing stages\n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/StarForm.html\">of\nstarbirth</a> and evolution.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2006/01/\">This detailed image</a> of the\nOrion Nebula is the sharpest ever, constructed using data from\nthe Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys\nand the European Southern Observatory's\n<a href=\"ap040923.html\">La Silla</a> 2.2 meter telescope.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2006/01/fastfacts/\">The mosaic</a>\ncontains a billion pixels at full resolution\nand reveals about 3,000 stars.\n\nIn apparent size, the picture is as large as the Full Moon.\n\nAt the distance of M42 it spans thirteen light-years.",
