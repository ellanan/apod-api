  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nRarely does a comet pass this close to Earth.  \n\nLast week, dedicated astrofilmographers were able to take advantage \nof the close approach of crumbling \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_73P\">73P / Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> to make time-lapse movies of the fast-moving comet.  \n\nLarge comet fragments passed about 25 times the Moon's distance from the Earth.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.cosmotions.com/vids/Comet_Thoroughfare_Lrg.gif\">above time lapse movie</a> of \n<a href=\"ap060504.html\">Fragment B</a> of \n<a href=\"ap060511.html\">Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado\">Colorado</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a> was taken during a single night, May 16, with 83 \nconsecutive 49-second exposures.  \n\nSome observers report being able to perceive the slight motion of \nthe comet with respect to the background stars using only their \n<a href=\"http://www.yesmag.bc.ca/Questions/binoculars.html\">binoculars</a> and without resorting to the creation of fancy digital time-lapse movies.\n\nFragment B of \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2006/pr-15-06.html\">Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> became just barely visible to the \nunaided eye two weeks ago but now is appearing to fade as the comet \nhas moved past the Earth and nears the Sun.  \n\nMany <a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> will be \non the watch for a particularly active meteor shower tonight as the \nEarth made its closest approach to orbit of \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1704_1.asp\">Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a> late yesterday.",
