  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nEight years ago \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AAS...193.3904A\">results</a> were \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R\">first presented</a> indicating that most of the energy in our universe is not in \nstars or galaxies but is tied to space itself.  \n\nIn the language of cosmologists, a large \n<a href=\"http://super.colorado.edu/~michaele/Lambda/lambda.html\">cosmological constant</a> is directly implied by new distant \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/supernovae.html\">supernovae</a> observations.  \n\nSuggestions of a \n<a href=\"http://pancake.uchicago.edu/~carroll/encyc/\">cosmological constant</a> (lambda) are \n<a href=\"http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/72500389/PDFSTART\">not new</a> -- they have existed since the advent of \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm\">modern relativistic cosmology</a>. \n\nSuch claims were not usually popular with astronomers, \nthough, because lambda is so unlike known universe components, because \nlambda's value appeared limited by other observations, \nand because less-strange cosmologies without lambda had \npreviously done well in explaining the data. \n\nWhat is noteworthy here is the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations and the good reputations of the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/oir/Research/supernova/highz/members.html\">scientists conducting</a> \n<a href=\"http://panisse.lbl.gov/public/\">the investigations</a>. \n\nOver the past eight years, independent \nteams of astronomers have continued to accumulate data \nthat appears to confirm the unsettling result. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/Research/supernova/highz/figures/pictures.html\">above picture</a> of a supernova that occurred in \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998AGM....14..P95D\">1994</a> \non the outskirts of a \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nwas taken by one of these collaborations.",
