  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThis is what Saturn looks like at night.  \n\nIn contrast to the \n<a href=\"ap040822.html\">human-made lights</a> that cause the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">nighttime side of Earth</a> to glow faintly, \nSaturn's faint nighttime glow is primarily caused by sunlight reflecting off of its own \n<a href=\"ap050525.html\">majestic rings</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08252\">above image</a> \nof Saturn at night was captured in July by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \nSaturn.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08252\">above image</a> \nwas taken when the Sun was far in front of the spacecraft. \n\nFrom this vantage point, the northern hemisphere of nighttime Saturn, visible on the left, appears eerily dark.  \n\nSunlit rings are visible ahead, but are abruptly cut off by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>'s shadow.\n\nIn Saturn's southern hemisphere, visible on the right, the dim reflected glow from the sunlit rings is most apparent.\n\nImprinted on this diffuse glow, though, are thin black stripes not discernable to any \n<a href=\"ap971227.html\">Earth telescope</a> -- the silhouetted \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings\">C ring</a> of Saturn.\n\nCassini has been orbiting Saturn since 2004 and its \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens\">mission</a> \nis scheduled to continue until 2008.",
