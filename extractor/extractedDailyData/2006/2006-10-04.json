  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA newly discovered comet has brightened enough to be visible this week with binoculars.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap050904.html\">picturesque comet</a> \nis already becoming a favored target for northern sky imagers.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.astrostudio.at/Astrofotos/astrofotos.php?k_id=69\">Pictured above</a> \njust last week, Comet SWAN showed a bright blue-green coma and an impressive tail.\n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006m4.html\">Comet C/2006 M4 (SWAN)</a> \nwas discovered in June in public images from the \n<a href=\"http://www.fmi.fi/research_space/space_7.html\">Solar Wind Anisotropies</a> \n(SWAN) instrument of NASA and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESA\">ESA</a>'s Sun-orbiting \n<a href=\"http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/\">SOHO</a> spacecraft.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet\">Comet</a> SWAN, near magnitude six, will be \n<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/images2006/04oct06/skymap_north.gif\">visible with binoculars</a> in the northeastern sky not far from the Big Dipper over the next few days before dawn.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2006M4/2006M4.html\">The comet</a> is expected to reach its peak brightness this week.\n\nPassing its closest to the Sun two days ago, \n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?ID=dK06M040;orb=1;cov=0#orb\">Comet SWAN</a> and will be at its closest to the Earth toward the end of this month.  \n\n\nComet SWAN's <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/mpec/K06/K06S89.html\">unusual orbit</a> appears to be \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992A&amp;A...259..692K\">hyperbolic</a>, \nmeaning that it will likely go off into \n<a href=\"ap020210.html\">interstellar space</a>, never to return.",
