  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow did this unusual Martian rock form?\n\nThe atypical two-toned rock, visible in the lower right of the <a href=\"http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/2/n/732/2N191352043EFFANBZP0715R0M1.HTML\">above image</a>, was photographed a few days ago by the \n<a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/mars-rover1.htm\">robotic Spirit rover</a> \ncurrently rolling across \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\">Mars</a>.  \n\nFor now, the \n<a href=\"http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/HTML/faqs.html\">environmental processes</a> \nthat created the rock remain a matter of \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/dec/HQ_05499_concepts.html\">speculation</a>.  \n\nFinding unusual rocks is not unusual for \n<a href=\"ap040104.html\">Spirit</a> or its twin rover \n<a href=\"ap040127.html\">Opportunity</a>, however.  \n\nOver the past two years, for example, the rovers have unexpectedly discovered very \n<a href=\"ap040405.html\">small gray pebbles</a> dubbed \n<a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=8\">blueberries</a>, and a rock out in the \n<a href=\"ap050121.html\">middle of nowhere</a> \nnow thought to be a \n<a href=\"http://meteorites.lpl.arizona.edu/intro.html\">meteorite</a>.  \n\nHaving investigated \n<a href=\"ap051114.html\">alien terrain</a> and having found clear \nevidence that part of Mars had a \n<a href=\"ap040303.html\">wet past</a>, the Earth-launched Martian rovers \nare now entering their \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2006-015\">third spectacular year</a> exploring the red planet.",
