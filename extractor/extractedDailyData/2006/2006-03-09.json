  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThis popular group is famous as the\n<a href=\"http://www.maa.agleia.de/Messier/E/More/m066gr.html\">Leo\nTriplet</a> - a gathering of three magnificent galaxies\nin one field of view.\n\nCrowd pleasers when imaged with even modest\ntelescopes, these galaxies can be introduced individually as\nNGC 3628 (top), M66 (bottom left), and M65 (bottom right).\n\nAll three are large\n<a href=\"http://cassfos02.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/\nGalaxies.html\">spiral galaxies</a>.\n\nThey tend to look dissimilar because their galactic disks are\ntilted at different angles to our line of sight.\n\n<a href=\"ap050408.html\">NGC 3628</a> is seen\n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">edge-on</a>,\nwith obscuring dust lanes\ncutting across the plane of the galaxy, while the disks\n<a href=\"ap040407.html\">of M66</a> and\n<a href=\"ap960812.html\">M65 are</a>\nboth inclined enough to show off their spiral structure. \n\nGravitational interactions between galaxies in the group\nhave also left telltale signs, including the\n<a href=\"ap030607.html\">warped</a> and inflated\ndisk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://astrosurf.com/antilhue/m65_m66.htm\">gorgeous\ndeep view</a> of the region spans about one degree\n(two full moons) on the sky.\n\nThe field covers over 500 thousand light-years at the\ntrio's estimated distance of 30 million light-years.",
