  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat caused that hole?  \n\nThe hole in question appears as a small dark circle on the far right.  \n\nIf the <a href=\"http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?t=879\">above image</a> of aerogel seems dull and uninteresting, then welcome to one aspect of real world science.  \n\nThe interesting part is that something created that dark hole, and it might well be one of the first pieces of matter ever captured from outside our Solar System.  \n\nWhatever created that hole was captured by the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel\">aerogel</a> of the robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_%28spacecraft%29\">Stardust spacecraft</a> that flew across \n<a href=\"http://eightplanets.org/overview.html\">our Solar System</a> for years and then \n<a href=\"ap060116.html\">returned a capsule</a> to Earth.  \n\nScientists are \n<a href=\"http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/01/10_dust.shtml\">now poring</a> over the aerogel, looking to see what particles have become trapped.  \n\nMany particles are surely from local \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap040103.html\">Comet Wild 2</a>, \nwhich Stardust flew past in 2004.  \n\nJust a few particles, though, perhaps 10 or less, are expected to be from outside our Solar System.  \n\nIt is so difficult to find them that the \n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/bios.html\">Stardust team</a> has created a \n<a href=\"http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/\">downloadable interactive microscope program</a> to allow anyone with a \n<a href=\"http://3gold.com/pictures/Computer/2.jpg\">standard computer</a> \nto help inspect aerogel slices and look for interstellar dust tracks.  \n\nGood \n<a href=\"http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/myevents_viewer.php?id=9471219V1\">candidate tracks</a> will later be inspected in great detail by members of the Stardust team.",
