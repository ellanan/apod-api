  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Pelican Nebula lies about 2,000 light-years\naway in the high flying constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/the_universe/\nConstellations/summer/cygnus.html&amp;edu=high\">Cygnus, the Swan</a>.\n\nAlso known as IC 5070,\nthis cosmic pelican is appropriately found\njust off the \"east coast\" of\nthe <a href=\"ap060816.html\">North America Nebula</a>\n(NGC 7000), another surprisingly familiar looking\n<a href=\"ap031023.html\">emission nebula in</a> Cygnus.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/NGC7000text.html\">Pelican\nand North America</a> nebulae are part of the\nsame <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201373\">large and\ncomplex</a> star forming region, almost as nearby as the\nbetter-known Orion Nebula.\n\nFrom our vantage point, \ndark dust clouds (upper left) help define\nthe Pelican's eye and long bill, while a\n<a href=\"ap000703.html\">bright front</a> of ionized gas\nsuggests the curved shape of the head and neck.\n\nBased on digitized black and white images from the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Oschin_telescope\">Samuel\nOschin</a> Telescope at Palomar Observatory,\n<a href=\"http://www.lightfigures.com/DSS2/ser1.htm\">this striking\nsynthesized</a> color view includes two bright foreground\nstars and spans about 30 light-years at the estimated distance\nof the Pelican Nebula.",
