  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe Moon almost ruined this photograph.  \nDuring late March and early April 1997, \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> \npassed nearly in front of the \n<a href=\"ap040718.html\">Andromeda Galaxy</a>.\n\nHere the <a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/1995o1.html\">Great Comet \nof 1997</a> and the \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m031.html\">Great Galaxy in Andromeda</a> were \n\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970401.html\">photographed together</a> \non 1997 March 24th.  \n\nThe problem was the brightness of the \n<a href=\"ap970924.html\">Moon</a>.  The <a href=\"\nhttp://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html\">Moon</a> was full that night and so bright that long \nexposures meant to capture the \n<a href=\"ap970416.html\">tails of Hale-Bopp</a> and the disk of \n<a href=\"ap961011.html\">M31</a> would capture instead \nonly moonlight reflected off the Earth's atmosphere.  \n\nBy the time the Moon would set, this opportunity would be gone.  \n\nThat's why this picture was taken during a total \n<a href=\"ap960926.html\">lunar eclipse</a>.",
