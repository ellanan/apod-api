  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhy are vast sections of Iapetus as dark as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal\">coal</a>?    \n\nNo one knows for sure.\n\nIapetus, the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/iapetus.html\">third largest moon</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>, \nwas inspected again as the Saturn-orbiting robot \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">Cassini spacecraft</a> swooped past the \nenigmatic world again late last year. \n\nThe dark material covers most of the surface visible in the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07660\">above image</a>, \nwhile the small portion near the top that appears almost white is of a\ncolor and reflectance more typical of Saturn's other moons.\n\nThe unknown material covers about half of the 1,500 kilometer\nwide moon.\n\nThe material is \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003DPS....35.0404B\">so dark</a> \nthat it reflects less than five percent of incident sunlight, \nyet overlays craters indicating that it was spread after the \ncraters were formed.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29\">Iapetus</a> \nhas other unexplained features.\n\nThe bright part of \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/saturn/iapetus.html\">Iapetus</a> \nis covered with unexplained long thin streaks.  \n\nThe orbit of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28mythology%29\">Iapetus</a> is also unusual, being tilted to the plane of Saturn's \norbit by an unusually high fifteen degrees.\n\nA <a href=\"ap050201.html\">strange ridge</a> \nabout 13 kilometers high crosses much of Iapetus near the \nequator and is visible\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07660\">near\nthe bottom</a>.  \n\nOddly, this ridge is almost exactly parallel with Iapetus' equator.\n\nThe exact shape of Iapetus remains undetermined, \nbut images indicate that it is quite strange -- \nsomething like a\n<a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/\ngenpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=99\">walnut</a>.   \n\nResearch into the formation and history of \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-bib_query?bibcode=2005AGUSM.P14A..03C\">mysterious Iapetus</a>\nis active and ongoing.",
