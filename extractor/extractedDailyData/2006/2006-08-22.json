  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat type of cloud is that?  It is not a\n<a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/department/classes/ge406/tjbrabec/cloud.html\">naturally occurring</a> one. \n \nLooking perhaps a bit like a gigantic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl\">owl</a> monster, the cloud\n<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/weekinphotos/060526-03.html\">pictured above</a>\nresulted from a series of flares released by an air force jet over the\n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zh.html\">Atlantic Ocean</a> in May.  \n \nThe jet that released the flares, a\n<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/c-17.htm\">C-17 Globemaster III</a>, is seen on the right.\n \nThe <a href=\"http://www.ordnance.org/flares.htm\">flares</a> release smoke and the resulting pattern is sometimes known as a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke\">smoke</a> angel.  \n \nThe circular eyes of the above smoke angel are caused by\nair spiraling off the plane's wings and are known as\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices\">wingtip vortices</a>.",
