  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes the structure in Comet SWAN's tail?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2006M4/2006M4.html\">Comet SWAN</a>, \nwhich unexpectedly flared up to naked-eye brightness last week, has been \nshowing detail in its \n<a href=\"ap050522.html\">ion tail</a> that might be described as \n<a href=\"ap041031.html\">ghostly</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">ion tail</a> is made of ionized gas, energized by ultraviolet light from the Sun and pushed outward by the solar wind.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/sun/wind.html\">solar wind</a> \nitself is quite structured and sculpted by the Sun's complex and ever changing \n<a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wmfield.html\">magnetic field</a>.  \n\nFollowing the wind, structure in Comet SWAN's \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/comet_worldbook.html\">tail</a> \ncan be seen to \n<a href=\"http://www.prairieastronomyclub.org/astrophotos/SWAN_10-28-06_0104UT_3X1_B3X3Small.gif\">move outward</a> \nfrom the Sun even alter its wavy appearance over time.  \n\nThe blue color of the ion tail is dominated by recombining \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide\">carbon monoxide</a> \natoms.    \n\nThe color of the coma surrounding the head of the comet is tinged green by\n slight amounts of the molecule \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen\">cyanogen</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.gralak.com/Astro/Swan-AP160-Oct-28-2006.jpg\">above image</a> was taken last week from California, USA.\n\nThis week may be the best remaining chance for northern hemisphere \nobservers to see the fading \n<a href=\"ap040512.html\">interplanetary snowball</a>.   \n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006m4.html\">SWAN</a> \nhas now passed both the Earth and the Sun and will fade as it moves away \nfrom the Earth and heads out into the vast space between the stars.",
