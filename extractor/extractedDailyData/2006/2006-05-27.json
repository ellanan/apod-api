  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIf you could <a href=\"ap000722.html\">see gamma rays</a> - photons\nwith a million or more times the energy of visible light - the\nMoon would appear brighter than the Sun!\n\nThe startling notion is demonstrated by this\nimage of the Moon from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope\n(<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/cgro/egret.html\">EGRET</a>)\nin orbit on NASA's\n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/index.html\">Compton\nGamma Ray Observatory</a> from April 1991 to June 2000.\n\nThen, the most sensitive instrument of its kind, even EGRET could\nnot see the quiet Sun which is extremely faint at gamma-ray energies.\n\nSo <a href=\"http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v28n4/aas189/abs/\nS025002.html\">why</a> is the Moon bright?\n\nHigh energy charged particles, known as\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/topics/snr_group/\ncosmic_rays.html\">cosmic rays</a>,\nconstantly bombard the unprotected lunar surface generating gamma-ray\nphotons.\n\nEGRET's <a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/epo/vu/\nindex.html\">gamma-ray vision</a>\nwas not sharp enough to resolve a lunar\ndisk or any surface features, but its sensitivity reveals the\n<a href=\"ap050331.html\">induced gamma-ray</a> moonglow.\n\n<a href=\"http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">So far unique</a>,\nthe image was generated from eight exposures\nmade during 1991-1994 and\ncovers a roughly 40 degree wide field of view with\ngamma-ray intensity represented in false color.",
