  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe past year was extraordinary for the discovery of extraterrestrial\nfountains and flows\n-- some offering new potential in the search for liquid water and the origin\nof life beyond planet Earth..\n\nIncreased evidence was uncovered that \n<a href=\"ap060608.html\">fountains</a> spurt not only from \n<a href=\"ap060310.html\">Saturn's moon Enceladus</a>, but from the \n<a href=\"ap060823.html\">dunes of Mars</a> as well.  \n\nLakes were found on \n<a href=\"ap060731.html\">Saturn's moon Titan</a>, and the residual of a \nflowing liquid was discovered on the \n<a href=\"ap061212.html\">walls of Martian craters</a>.  \n\nThe diverse \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system\">Solar System</a> \nfluidity may involve forms of slushy water-ice, \n<a href=\"http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/methane/methane.html\">methane</a>, or \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nSublimation_%28physics%29\">sublimating</a> \n<a href=\"http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/CO2/CO2.html\">carbon\ndioxide</a>.  \n\n<a href=\" http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09028\">Pictured\nabove</a>, the \nlight-colored path below the image center is hypothesized \nto have been created sometime in just the past few years by \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/mgs-20061206.html\">liquid water flowing</a> across the surface of \n<a href=\"mars.html\">Mars</a>.",
