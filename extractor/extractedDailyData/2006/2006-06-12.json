  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy is this galaxy so thin?  \n\nMany disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/24/\">pictured above</a>, but are not \n<a href=\"ap010510.html\">seen edge-on</a> from our vantage point.  \n\nOne galaxy that is situated edge-on is our own \n<a href=\"ap050605.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nClassified as a \n<a href=\"ap020408.html\">lenticular galaxy</a>, NGC 5866 \nhas numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, \nwhile many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue. \n\nThe blue disk of young stars can be seen extending past the \n<a href=\"ap990919.html\">dust</a> in the extremely thin galactic plane, \nwhile the bulge in the disk center appears tinged more orange from the \nolder and redder stars that likely exist there.\n\nAlthough similar in mass to our Milky Way Galaxy, light takes about 60,000 \n<a href=\"http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">years</a> to cross \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003AAS...20311002K\">NGC 5866</a>, about 30 percent less than light takes to cross our own Galaxy.\n\nIn general, many disk galaxies are very thin because the gas that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution\">formed them</a> collided with itself as it rotated about the gravitational center.\n\n\nGalaxy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866\">NGC 5866</a> \nlies about 44 million light years distant toward the constellation of the Dragon\n(<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=34\">Draco</a>).",
