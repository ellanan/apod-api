  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes the powerful explosions known as gamma-ray bursts?   \n\n<a href=\"http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/publicity/chapic/chap1.jpg\">Astrophysicists</a> still aren't sure, but the longest duration \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_burst\">gamma-ray bursts</a> \n(GRBs) seem to involve very massive stars.  \n\nA <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/20/full/\">new clue</a> indicating this was uncovered recently by a series of images taken by the \norbiting <a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.   \n\nThese images, \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/20/image/\">shown above</a>, indicate that \n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/2006/20/images/h/formats/web_print.jpg\">long duration GRBs</a> typically appear to come from galaxies and \nregions of galaxies with bright regions rich with \n<a href=\"ap051211.html\">star formation and bright, massive stars</a>.   \n\nLong GRBs are therefore different than many types of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova\">supernovas</a>, \nwhich occur more uniformly distributed in their host galaxies.  \n\nSince such active star forming regions are \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603537\">relatively rare</a> in our \n<a href=\"ap050825.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, the chances of a \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/gamma/milkyway2.html\">nearby GRB affecting life</a> on Earth are \n<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050106_odds_of_dying.html\">relatively slight</a>.",
