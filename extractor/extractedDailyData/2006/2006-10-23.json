  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMeteors have been flowing out from the constellation Orion.  \n\nThis was expected, as mid-October is the time of year for the \n<a href=\"http://www.serve.com/wh6ef/comets/meteors/showers/orionidobs.html\">Orionids Meteor Shower</a>.  \n\nPictured above, over a dozen meteors were caught in successively \nadded exposures over three hours taken this past weekend from a town near \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa%2C_Turkey\">Bursa</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a>.  \n\nThe above image shows brilliant \n<a href=\"ap031116.html\">multiple meteor streaks</a> \nthat can all be connected to a single point in the sky just above the \n<a href=\"ap040304.html\">belt of Orion</a>, called the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/meteors/showers.html\">radiant</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orionids\">Orionids</a> \nmeteors started as sand sized bits expelled from \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">Comet Halley</a> \nduring one of its trips to the inner Solar System.  \n\nComet Halley is actually responsible for two \n<a href=\"http://www.amsmeteors.org/showers.html\">known meteor showers</a>, \nthe other known as the Eta Aquarids and visible every May.  Next month, the \n<a href=\"http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/2006/info2006.html\">Leonids Meteor Shower</a> \nfrom <a href=\"ap021116.html\">Comet Tempel-Tuttle</a> might show an \neven more impressive shower from <a href=\"ap020602.html\">some locations</a>.",
