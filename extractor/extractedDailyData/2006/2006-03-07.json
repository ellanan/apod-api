  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nOne of the nearer supernovas of recent years was discovered \nlast month in the bright nearby galaxy \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m100.html\">M100</a>. \n\nThe supernova, dubbed \n<a href=\"http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2006/sn2006x.html\">SN 2006X</a>, \nis still near its maximum brightness and visible with a telescope \ntoward the constellation of Berenice's Hair \n(<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=25\">Coma Berenices</a>)\n\nThe supernova, \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2006/phot-08-06.html\">pictured above</a>, has been identified as \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Type_Ia\">Type Ia</a> indicating that a \n<a href=\"ap000910.html\">white dwarf star</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap010203.html\">picturesque spiral</a> galaxy has gone near its \n<a href=\"http://physics.ship.edu/~mrc/pfs/108/node5.htm\">Chandrasekhar limit</a> \nand exploded.  \n\nAlthough hundreds of supernovas are now discovered each year by automated searches, \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/02/23/m100-before-and-after/\">nearby supernova</a> are rare and important because they frequently become bright enough to be studied by many telescopes and are near enough for their immediate surroundings to be spatially resolved.  \n\nSupernova \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2006X\">2006X</a>'s host galaxy M100 \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/local_supercluster.html\">resides</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap000220.html\">Virgo Cluster of Galaxies</a> located about 50 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> from Earth.",
