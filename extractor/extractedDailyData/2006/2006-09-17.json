  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening over the horizon?  \n\nAlthough the scene may appear somehow \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html\">supernatural</a>, \nnothing more unusual is occurring than a \n<a href=\"ap980526.html\">setting Sun</a> and some well placed clouds.  \n\nStrangely, the actual sunset was occurring in the opposite direction from where the camera was pointing. \n\nPictured above are \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/atoptics/anti1.htm\">anticrepuscular rays</a>.  \n\nTo understand them, start by picturing common \n<a href=\"http://www.ems.psu.edu/~demark/471/CrepuscularRays.html\">crepuscular rays</a> that are seen any time that sunlight pours though scattered clouds. \n\nNow although sunlight indeed travels along \n<a href=\"http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/patricia/grelb.html\">straight lines</a>, the projections of these lines onto the \n<a href=\"http://math.rice.edu/~pcmi/sphere/\">spherical sky</a> are \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circles\">great circles</a>.  \n\nTherefore, the \n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/atmosphere/sunrays.html\">crepuscular rays</a> from a \n<a href=\"ap030123.html\">setting (or rising) sun</a> \nwill appear to re-converge on the other side of the sky.  \n\nAt the anti-solar point 180 degrees around from the \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a>, they are referred to as \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/atoptics/antray2.htm\">anticrepuscular rays</a>.\n\nWhile enjoying the sunset after visiting NASA's \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html\">Kennedy Space Center</a> in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida\">Florida</a>,  \nthe photographer chanced to find that an even \nmore spectacular sight was occurring in the other direction just over the \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zh.html\">Atlantic Ocean</a> -- a particularly vivid set of \n<a href=\"http://www.gcrg.org/bqr/6-4/optics.htm\">anticrepuscular rays</a>.",
