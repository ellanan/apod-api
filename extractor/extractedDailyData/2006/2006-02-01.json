  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs that Venus or an airplane?  \n\nA common ponderable for \n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> is deciding if that bright spot \nnear the horizon is the planet \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html\">Venus</a>.  \n\nUsually, an airplane will show itself by moving significantly in a few moments.  \n\nVenus will set only slowly as the \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">Earth turns</a>.  \n\nStill, the identification would be easier if Venus did not keep \n<a href=\"ap010601.html\">shifting its position</a> each night.  \n\nPictured above, \n<a href=\"ap060110.html\">Venus</a> was captured 38 different nights during 2005 and 2006 over \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa%2C_Turkey\">Bursa</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/tu.html\">Turkey</a>, when \n<a href=\"ap950815.html\">Earth's sister planet</a> appeared exclusively in the evening sky.  \n\nThe average spacing of the images was about five days, while the images \nwere always taken with the Sun about 7 degrees below the horizon.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus\">Venus' orbit</a> \naround the Sun will now confine it to Earth's \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/planets/\">morning sky until October</a> 2006.",
