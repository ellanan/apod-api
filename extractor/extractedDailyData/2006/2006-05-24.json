  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happening near the center of this cluster of galaxies?  \n\nAt first glance, it appears that several strangely \n<a href=\"ap950710.html\">elongated galaxies</a> and fully five bright \nquasars exist there.  \n\nIn reality, an entire cluster of galaxies is acting as a \n<a href=\"ap040807.html\">gigantic gravitational lens</a> that distorts and multiply-images bright objects that occur far in the distance.   \n\nThe five bright white points near the cluster center are actually images of a single distant \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar\">quasar</a>.   \n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nimage is so detailed that even the \n<a href=\"ap980409.html\">host galaxy</a> surrounding the quasar is visible.  \n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/23/image/a+zoom\">Close inspection</a> of the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/23/\">above image</a> will reveal that the arced galaxies at 2 and 4 o'clock are actually \n<a href=\"http://www.iam.ubc.ca/~newbury/lenses/research.html\">gravitationally lensed</a> \nimages of the same galaxy.  \n\nA third image of that galaxy \n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/2006/23/images/b/formats/web_print.jpg\">can be found</a> at about 10 o'clock from the cluster center.  \n\nSerendipitously, numerous \n<a href=\"ap020901.html\">strange and distant galaxies</a> dot the above image like \n<a href=\"ap060501.html\">colorful jewels</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_of_galaxies\">cluster of galaxy</a> that acts as the huge gravitational lens is cataloged as SDSS J1004+4112 and lies about 7 billion \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> \ndistant toward the \n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/const.html\">constellation</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/leominor/constell.html\">Leo Minor</a>.",
