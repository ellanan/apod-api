  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThere, that faint dot in the center - that's the largest rock known in our \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html\">Solar System</a>. \n\nIt is larger than every known \n<a href=\"ap040619.html\">asteroid</a>, \n<a href=\"ap041119.html\">moon</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap050915.html\">comet nucleus</a>.  \n\nIt is larger than any other local rocky planet. \n(Nobody knows for sure what size rocks lie at the cores of Jovian planets, or orbit other stars.) \n\nIt used to be the largest rock of any type known \n<a href=\"ap050614.html\">until earlier</a> last year.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Voyager 1</a> \nspacecraft took the above picture of the giant space rock in \n1990 from the outer Solar System. \n\nThis rock is so large its gravity makes it nearly spherical, \nand holds heavy gases near its surface.\n\nToday, this rock starts another orbit around its parent star, for roughly the 5 billionth time, \nspinning over 350 times during each trip.\n\n\nHappy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_Calendar\">Gregorian Calendar</a> \nNew Year to all the \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">human inhabitants</a> of \n<a href=\"http://obs.nineplanets.org/psc/pbd.html\">this rock</a> we call \n<a href=\"ap050102.html\">Earth</a>.",
