  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nScroll right to see the largest crater yet visited by a rover on Mars.  \n\nReaching the expansive \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_crater\">Victoria Crater</a> \nhas been a \n<a href=\"ap060605.html\">goal</a> for the \n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">robotic Opportunity rover</a> rolling across \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> for the past 21 months.  \n\nOpportunity reached Victoria last week, and is cautiously probing the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium\">stadium</a>-sized crevice.  \n\nIt is hoped that Victoria Crater will show a \n<a href=\"ap041115.html\">deep stack of layers</a> uncovered by the initial impact, \nand hence new clues into the ancient surface history of Mars.\n\nVisible in the distance of the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08783\">above image</a> \nmosaic is the far rim of Victoria Crater, lying about 800 meters away and rising about \n70 meters above the crater floor.   The alcove in front has been dubbed Duck Bay.  \n\nVictoria crater has about five times the diameter of \n<a href=\"ap040510.html\">Endurance Crater</a>, which Opportunity spent six months exploring.  \n\nIf a safe path is found, Opportunity may actually \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060927_victoria_crater.html\">attempt to enter</a> Victoria Crater.",
