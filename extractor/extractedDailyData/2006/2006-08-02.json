  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMight it rain cold methane on Saturn's Titan?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060724/full/060724-7.html\">Recent analyses</a> of measurements taken by the \n<a href=\"ap060131.html\">Huygen's probe</a> that landed on \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28moon%29\">Titan</a> in 2005 January indicate that the atmosphere is actually saturated with \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> at a height of about 8 kilometers.  \n\nCombined with observations of a \n<a href=\"ap050117.html\">damp surface</a> and \n<a href=\"ap060731.html\">lakes</a> near the poles, \nsome astrobiologists conclude that at least a <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2006/06_57AR.html\">methane drizzle</a> is common on parts of Titan.  \n\nOther \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7101/abs/nature04933.html\">astrobiologists reported</a> computer models of the \nclouded moon that indicate that violent methane storms \nmight even occur, complete with flash floods carving \n<a href=\"ap060508.html\">channels</a> in the landscape.  \n\nThe later scenario is depicted in the above drawing of Titan.    \n\n<a href=\"ap040818.html\">Lightning</a>, \nas also depicted above, might well exist on Titan but has not been proven.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000658/\">findings</a> increase speculation that a wet \n<a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1766.html\">Titanian surface</a> might be hospitable to unusual \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M\">forms of life</a>.",
