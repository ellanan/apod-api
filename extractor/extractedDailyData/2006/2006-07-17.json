  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHumanity now has a spacecraft orbiting Venus.  \n\nThe robotic \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Express\">Venus Express spacecraft</a> \nlaunched by the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/index.html\">European Space Agency</a> in 2005 November arrived at \n<a href=\"venus.html\">Venus</a> in 2006 April.  \n\nVenus Express is now orbiting Earth's sister planet and returning pictures.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEM9A3XAIPE_1.html\">Pictured above</a> is a false-color, time-lapse movie in \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/uv.html\">ultraviolet light</a> \ncaptured by the Venus Express spacecraft as it flew over \n<a href=\"ap040516.html\">Venus</a>' northern hemisphere in late May.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEMBD3808BE_0.html\">Venus Express</a> is scheduled to orbit \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEM9C3808BE_0.html\">Venus</a> for three years and collect data that might help in answering \nquestions that include why Venus continually generates \n<a href=\"ap040915.html\">hurricane-force</a> winds, \nwhy Venus became \n<a href=\"ap050410.html\">so hot</a> in the past, and if there is any current volcanic activity on \n<a href=\"ap031130.html\">Venus</a>.  \n\nIt is hoped that a better understanding of \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEMFPY808BE_0.html\">Venus's hot</a> and inhospitable climate will help humanity better understand \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/02/990223083118.htm\">Earth's climate</a> as well.",
