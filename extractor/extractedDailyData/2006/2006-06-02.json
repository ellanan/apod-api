  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIC 443 is typical of the\n<a href=\"ap011026.html\">aftermath</a>\nof a stellar explosion, the ultimate fate of massive stars.\n\nSeen in <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/ic443/\">this\nfalse-color</a> composite image, the\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nsupernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a> is still glowing\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nemspectrum.html\">across the spectrum</a>,\nfrom radio (blue) to optical (red) to x-ray (green) energies --\neven though light from the stellar\nexplosion that created the expanding cosmic cloud first\nreached planet Earth thousands of years ago.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/ic443/\nanimations.html\">The odd thing</a> about IC 443 is the apparent\nmotion of its dense\n<a href=\"ap030201.html\">neutron star</a>, the collapsed remnant of the\nstellar core.\n\nThe close-up inset shows the swept-back wake created as the neutron star\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph?papernum=0601304\">hurtles</a>\nthrough the hot gas, but that direction\nis not aligned with the direction toward the apparent center of\nthe remnant.\n\nThe misalignment suggests that the\n<a href=\"ap050910.html\">explosion</a> site was offset\nfrom the center or that fast-moving gas in the nebula has\ninfluenced the wake.\n\nThe wide view of <a href=\"ap970502.html\">IC 443</a>, also known as the\n<a href=\"ap040408.html\">Jellyfish</a> nebula,\nspans about 65 light-years at the supernova remnant's\nestimated distance of 5,000 light-years.",
