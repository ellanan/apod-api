  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat do you call an outer Solar System object that is larger than Pluto?  \n\nNobody is yet sure.  \n\nThe question arose recently when \n<a href=\"ap050801.html\">2003 UB313</a>, \nan object currently twice as far out as Pluto and not in the \n<a href=\"ap001014.html\">plane</a> with the rest of the planets, was \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~bertoldi/ub313/\">verified recently</a> \nto be 30 percent wider than \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/pluto.html\">Pluto</a>.  \n\nUB313's size was measured by a noting its distance from the \n<a href=\"ap051109.html\">Sun</a> and how much \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a> it emits.  \n\nPrevious <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/02/02/GR2006020200066.html\">size</a> estimates were based only on visible light and greatly \naffected by how reflective the object is.  \n\nWhether <a href=\"http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/\">2003 UB313</a> \nis officially declared a planet will be answered shortly by the \n<a href=\"http://www.iau.org/\">International Astronomical Union</a>.  \n\nIn the above picture, a scientific artist has imagined \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_UB313\">UB313</a> in its \n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=142\">distant orbit</a> around the Sun coupled with a hypothetical moon.",
