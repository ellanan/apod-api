  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAn unusual spot has been found on Mars that scientists believe is not natural in origin.  \n\nThe spot appears mobile and is now hypothesized to be a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot\">robot</a> created by an \n<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,989714,00.html\">intelligent species</a> alien to Mars.  \n\nIn fact, the spot appears to be NASA's robotic Opportunity rover currently rolling across Mars.\n\nThe ability to see the Martian rover from orbit has recently been demonstrated by the \n<a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/\">High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment</a> \non NASA's \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter\">Mars \nReconnaissance Orbiter</a> (MRO).   \n\nThe new spacecraft achieved orbit around Mars in 2006 March.\n\nLast week, MRO imaged the location of \n<a href=\"ap061002.html\">Victoria Crater</a> \nand the \n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">rover Opportunity</a> that had just arrived there.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08816\">above image</a> at spectacularly \n<a href=\"ap060410.html\">high resolution</a>, objects about one meter in size are resolved, and this includes the rolling rover.  \n\nSuch images may help scientists better determine if any safe path exists for Opportunity to enter large crater.  \n\nIn the <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08813\">inset image</a> \non the upper left, the whole of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_crater\">Victoria Crater</a> \nwas also imaged by MRO.",
