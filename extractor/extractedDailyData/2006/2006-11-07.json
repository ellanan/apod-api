  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nJanus is one of the stranger moons of Saturn.  \n\nFirst, <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/janus.html\">Janus</a> \ntravels in an unusual orbit around Saturn where it periodically trades places with its sister moon \n<a href=\"ap050429.html\">Epimetheus</a>, \nwhich typically orbits about 50 kilometers away.   \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_%28moon%29\">Janus</a>, \nalthough slightly larger than \n<a href=\"ap050824.html\">Epimetheus</a>, is \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato\">potato</a>-shaped and \nhas a largest diameter of about 190 kilometers.  \n\nNext, Janus is covered with large craters but strangely appears to lack small craters.  \n\nOne possible reason for this is a fine dust that might cover the small moon, \na surface also hypothesized for \n<a href=\"ap051123.html\">Pandora</a> and \n<a href=\"ap060222.html\">Telesto</a>.  \n\n\nPictured <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08296\">above</a>, \nJanus was captured in front of the \n<a href=\"ap051010.html\">cloud tops</a> of \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a> in late September.",
