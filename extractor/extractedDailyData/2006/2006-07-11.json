  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSoft hues, partially lit orbs, a thin trace of the ring, and slight shadows highlight this understated view of the majestic surroundings of the giant planet Saturn.  \n\nLooking nearly back toward the Sun, the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens\">robot Cassini \nspacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn captured \n<a href=\"ap060618.html\">crescent phases</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> and its \n<a href=\"ap060530.html\">moon Rhea</a> in color a few months ago.\n\nAs striking as the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07806\">above image</a> is, it is but a single frame from a recently released \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA07806.mov\">60-frame silent movie</a> where Rhea can be seen gliding in front of its parent world.   \n\nSince Cassini was nearly in the plane of \n<a href=\"http://pds-rings.seti.org/saturn/\">Saturn's rings</a>, the normally impressive rings are visible here only as a \n<a href=\"ap051219.html\">thin line</a> across the image center.\n\nCassini has now passed the official half-way mark of its mission around Saturn, but is well situated to complete \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-release-details.cfm?newsID=670\">another two years</a> investigating this complex and surprising system.",
