  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950616.html\">first APOD</a> appeared eleven years ago today, on 1995 June 16.  \n\nAlthough garnering only 14 page views on that day, \n<a href=\"ap050616.html\">we</a> are proud to estimate that \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APOD\">APOD</a> has now\nserved over 400 <i>million</i> space-related images over the last eleven years.  \n\nThat early beginning, along with a nearly unchanging format, has allowed APOD to be a consistent and familiar site on a web frequently filled with change.   \n\nMany people don't know, though, that APOD is now \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">translated daily</a> into many major languages.\n\nWe again thank our readers and \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> \nfor their continued support, but ask that any\npotentially congratulatory e-mail go to the folks \nwho created the great pictures -- many times \nwith considerable effort -- that \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD</a> has been fortunate enough to feature over the past year.  \n\nMany can be contacted by following links found in the \ncredit line under the image.  \n\nSome of these images are featured in the \nabove spectacular collage of a fantasy sky above Mars submitted by an \nenthusiastic <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap_faq.html\">APOD</a> reader skilled in digital image manipulation.\n\n<a href=\"http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewforum.php?f=9\">How many</a> APOD images can you identify?",
