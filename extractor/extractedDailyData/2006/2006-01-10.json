  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nVenus goes through phases.  \n\nJust like our <a href=\"ap051113.html\">Moon</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html\">Venus</a> \ncan appear as full as a disk or as a \n<a href=\"ap040521.html\">thin as a crescent</a>.  \n\nVenus, frequently the brightest object in the post-sunset or pre-sunrise sky, \nappears so small, however, that it usually requires \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars\">binoculars</a> or a \n<a href=\"ap011014.html\">small telescope</a> to clearly see its current phase.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.hkastroforum.net/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2325\">above time-lapse sequence</a>, however, was taken over the \ncourse of many months and shows not only how Venus changes phase \nbut how it's apparent \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/YBA/HTCas-size/more-ang_size.html\">angular size</a> also changes.  \n\nIn the middle negative image, Venus is in a new phase, the same phase that occurred during its \n<a href=\"ap040615.html\">rare partial eclipse</a> of the Sun in 2004.",
