  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat creates the cosmic dust sculptures in the Rosette Nebula?  \n\nNoted for the common beauty of its \n<a href=\"ap010214.html\">overall shape</a>, parts of the \n<a href=\"ap020317.html\">Rosette Nebula</a>, also known as NGC 2244, \nshow beauty even when viewed up close.  \n\n<a href=\"http://astrosurf.com/nico-outters/astro/rosetta%20nebulae%20HarharGB.htm\">Visible above</a> are \n<a href=\"ap030816.html\">globules</a> of dark \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> and gas that are slowly being \n<a href=\"ap041004.html\">eroded</a> away by the energetic light and \nwinds by nearby massive stars.  \n\nLeft alone long enough, the \n<a href=\"ap030202.html\">molecular-cloud globules</a> \nwould likely form stars and planets.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap000111.html\">Rosette Nebula</a> spans about 50 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> across, lies \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26A...358..553H\">about 4,500 light-years away</a>, \nand can be seen with a small telescope towards the <a href=\"\nhttp://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"\nhttp://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=55\">Monoceros</a>.\n\nHappy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_day\">Valentine's Day</a> from the folks at APOD.",
