  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA newly discovered comet may outshine most stars in the sky by May.  \n\nDesignated <a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002t7.html\">Comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR)</a>, the comet was discovered in 2002 October by \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/\">project LINEAR</a>.  \n\nMany <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#02T7\">reports</a> already place the comet as brighter than \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 7, meaning that it can now be seen with binoculars.\n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#02T7\">Reports</a> also indicate the comet already has a visible \n<a href=\"ap001227.html\">tail</a> nearly the length of a \n<a href=\"ap030810.html\">full Moon</a>.\n\nSince predicting the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2002T7.html\">future brightness</a> of comets is a very \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/exploring/space/kohoutek.html\">tricky business</a>, there remains the possibility that \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1037_2.asp\">T7</a> might never become visible to the unaided eye.  \n\nAlternatively, another comet, \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/comet_NEAT_2004_030516.html\">C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)</a>, may also \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2001Q4.html\">reach naked eye visibility</a> at nearly the same time, \nmaking 2004 April and May two of the busiest \nbright-comet months in centuries.  \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1037_1.asp\">Comet</a> T7 can be seen on the above right on January 20, \nwhile an airplane trail is visible on the left.",
