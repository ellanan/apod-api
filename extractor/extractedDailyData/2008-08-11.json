  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs that a black hole?  \n\nQuite possibly.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1\">Cygnus X-1</a> \nbinary star system contains one of the best candidates for a \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">black hole</a>.\n\nThe system was discovered because it is one of the brightest \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/xrays.html\">X-ray</a> \nsources on the sky, shining so bright it was detected by the \n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/images/pretty_pictures_early.html\">earliest rockets</a> \ncarrying cameras capable of seeing the previously unknown \n<a href=\"ap000819.html\">X-ray sky</a>.  \n\nThe star's very name indicates that it is the single brightest X-ray source in the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_constellations\">constellation</a> \nof the Swan <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cygnus.html\">Cygnus</a>.\n\nData indicate that a \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_star\">compact object</a> \nthere contains about nine times the mass of the Sun and changes its \nbrightness continually on several time scales, at least down to milliseconds.  \n\nSuch behavior is expected for a \n<a href=\"http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/BHfaq.html\">black hole</a>, \nand difficult to explain with other models.  \n\nPictured above is an artistic impression of the \n<a href=\"http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/research/cygx1.html\">Cygnus X-1</a> system.  \n\nOn the left is the bright blue \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergiant\">supergiant star</a> \ndesignated HDE 226868, which is estimated as having about 30 times the mass of our Sun.  \n\n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=32709\">Cygnus X-1 is depicted</a> on the right, connected to its \nsupergiant companion by a stream of gas, and surrounded by an impressive \n<a href=\"ap050312.html\">accretion disk</a>.\n\nThe bright star in the \n<a href=\"http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rush/cygnus+x1_20119975.html\">Cygnus X-1</a> system is visible with a small telescope.\n\nStrangely, the \n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/goodies/posters/html/cygnus_x1.html\">Cygnus X-1</a> black hole candidate \n<a href=\"ap050402.html\">appears</a> to have formed without a bright \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8srN24pSQ\">supernova explosion</a>.",
