  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCan you find \n<a href=\"ap970124.html\">Supernova 1987a</a>?  \nIt's not hard - it occurred in the center of the bulls-eye pattern.  Although this \n<a href=\"http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html\">stellar \ndetonation</a> was seen more than a decade ago, \nlight from it continues to bounce off nearby \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">interstellar dust</a> and be reflected to us.  \nThese two rings are thus echoes of the powerful \n<a href=\"http://cssa.stanford.edu/~marcos/snetax.html\">supernova</a>.  \nAs time goes on, these <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995ApJ%2E%2E%2E451%2E%2E806X&amp;db_key=AST\">echoes</a> appear to expand outward from the center.  \nThe above image was created by subtracting a picture taken \n<i>before</i> 1987, from a picture taken after.",
