  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThis picture was taken by the <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html\">Voyager 2</a> spacecraft in 1989 - the only spacecraft\never to visit Neptune. <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html\">Neptune</a> will be the farthest planet from the \n<a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a> until 1999, when the\nelliptical orbit of \n<a href=\"ap971228.html\">Pluto</a> \nwill cause it to once again resume this status. <a href=\"http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/neptune.htm\">Neptune</a>, like <a href=\"http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/uranus.htm\">Uranus</a>, is composed mostly of liquid water, \nmethane and ammonia, is surrounded by a thick gas\natmosphere of mostly hydrogen and helium, \nand has many moons and rings. Neptune's moon\n<a href=\"ap971123.html\">Triton</a> is unlike any \nother and has active volcanoes. The nature of \nTriton's unusual orbit around\n<a href=\"ap970529.html\">Neptune</a> \nis the focus of much discussion and speculation.",
