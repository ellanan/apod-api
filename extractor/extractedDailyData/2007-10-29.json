  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat's happened to Comet Holmes?  \n\nA normally docile comet discovered over 100 years ago, \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/017p.html\">Comet 17P/Holmes</a> \nsuddenly became nearly one million times brighter last week, \npossibly over just a few hours.  \n\nIn astronomical terms, the comet brightened from \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/stars/magnitudes.html\">magnitude</a> 17, only visible through a good telescope, to magnitude 3, becoming visible with the unaided eye.   \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17P/Holmes\">Comet Holmes</a> \nhad already passed its closest to the Sun in 2007 May outside the orbit of Mars \nand was \n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=17P;orb=1\">heading back out</a> \nnear Jupiter's orbit when the outburst occurred.  \n\nThe comet's sudden brightening is likely due to some sort of sunlight-reflecting \n<a href=\"ap040319.html\">outgassing</a> event, possibly related to ice melting over a gas-filled cavern, or possibly even a partial breakup of the comet's nucleus.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsoftlab.com/gallery/solar-system-images.htm\">Pictured above</a> \nthrough a small telescope last Thursday, \n<a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/10775326.html\">Comet Holmes</a> appeared as a fuzzy yellow spot, \nsignificantly larger in angular size than Earth-atmosphere \n<a href=\"ap000725.html\">blurred distant stars</a>.\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/spacewatch/071025-comet-holmes.html\">Comet Holmes'</a> orbit will \n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=17P;orb=1\">place it</a> \nin northern hemisphere skies for the next two years, \nwhether it will best be viewed through a \n<a href=\"ap060806.html\">telescope</a> or \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXw4qqQqTrY\">sunglasses</a> remains unknown.",
