  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe colors of Mercury are subtle but beautiful.\n\nAt first glance, our \n<a href=\" http://www.kidsastronomy.com/solar_system.htm\">Solar System</a>'s \ninnermost planet appears simply \n<a href=\"ap031109.html\">black and white</a>, \nbut images that include \n<a href=\"http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html\">infrared</a> \ncolors normally beyond human vision accentuate a world of detail.\n\nOne such image, <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=143\">shown above</a>, was acquired by the robotic \n<a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/index.html\">MESSENGER spacecraft</a> \nthat <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/0130_MESSENGERs_First_Mercury_Flyby_Reveals.html\">swung by Mercury</a> in mid-January.\n\nHere, most generally, the hot world itself acquires a slightly more brown hue.  \n\nMany <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater\">craters</a> that appear on top of other craters -- and so surely have formed more recently -- appear here as bright with bright rays that include a slightly blue tint, indicating that soil upended during the impact was light in color.  \n\nA few craters, such as some in the huge \n<a href=\"ap960120.html\">Caloris Basin</a> impact feature visible on the upper right, appear unexpectedly to be <a href=\"http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=166\">ringed with a dark material</a>, the nature of which is being researched.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER\">MESSENGER</a> continues to glide through the inner Solar System and will pass \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29\">Mercury</a> \nagain this October and next September, before entering orbit around the desolate world in 2011.",
