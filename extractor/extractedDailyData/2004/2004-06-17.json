  "title": "Comet NEAT and the Beehive Cluster",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTo the unaided eye, they appeared as similar fuzzy patches.  \n\nBut when a bright comet passed in front of a bright \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">star cluster</a> last month, \nbinoculars and cameras were able to show off their marked differences in dramatic fashion.  \n\nPictured above, the bright comet, <a href=\"http://www.astronomy.com/Content/Dynamic/Articles/000/000/001/727bsdvn.asp\">C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)</a> shows many details of its coma and tail, while far in the distance the Beehive open cluster, \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m044.html\">M44</a>, \nshows many of its stars.  \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1262_1.asp\">Comet Q4</a> has now faded to the edge of unaided visibility and can best be found with a \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/charts.html\">sky map</a> \nand binoculars from the Northern Hemisphere well into June.  \n\nStar cluster \n<a href=\"ap980803.html\">M44</a> \nwill remain an impressive star cluster toward the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/portal/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=12\">Cancer</a> indefinitely.",
