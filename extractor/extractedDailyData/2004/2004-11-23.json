  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe 2004 Leonids meteor shower had its ups and downs.  \n\nAlthough average rates were significantly less than many previous years, \nas expected, at least two unexpected \n\"<a href=\"http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/04comment1.txt\">mini-outbursts</a>\" of several bright meteors over a few minutes were reported.  \n\n<a href=\"http://nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?t=233\">Pictured above</a>, a bright \n<a href=\"http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/\">Leonid meteor</a> was imaged by a \n<a href=\"http://NightSkyLive.net/\">Night Sky Live</a> camera over \n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/kpno/\">Kitt Peak National Observatory</a> \nearly in the morning of November 19 during one mini-outburst.  \n\nThe meteor appears as the streak just to the left of the \ngreen \"Ursa Major\" label.  \n\nMoving your cursor over the image will show the \nimage taken about 25 minutes later where two bright \n<a href=\"http://lists.meteorobs.org/pipermail/meteorobs/2004-November/\">Leonid meteors</a> from a second mini-outburst were recorded, \nvisible on the lower right just to the left of the green words \n\"Canis\" and \"Minor\".  \n\nThe stars appear to shift between the two images because of the \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">rotation of the Earth</a>.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?t=233\">Night Sky Live</a> frames show \n<a href=\"http://nightskylive.net/NightSkyLive_for_beginners.html\">fisheye images</a>, capturing the entire sky as a \nperson would see it looking straight up, including \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/peripheral_vision.html\">peripheral vision</a>.  \n\nIn mid-December, the \n<a href=\"http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/geminidhistory.html\">Geminids meteor shower</a> will give \n<a href=\"ap040808.html\">sky enthusiasts</a> another good chance to \n<a href=\"http://stardate.org/nightsky/meteors/\">see live meteors</a>.",
