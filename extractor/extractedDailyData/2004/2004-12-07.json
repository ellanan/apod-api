  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMeteor experts don't think it's a \n<a href=\"ap030506.html\">meteor</a>.  \n\nAtmospheric scientists don't think it's \n<a href=\"ap041007.html\">lightning</a>.  \n\nThe photographer insists that the streak and \nflash on the above image has not been created digitally.  \n\nSo what is it?  Nobody is sure. \n\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html\">APOD's editors</a> do not claim to know - one purpose of \nposting this image is to mine the eclectic brain trust of \n<a href=\"http://www.cubookstore.com/graduation/images/graduation-day.gif\">APOD's readers</a> to help see if some unusual phenomenon was caught serendipitously.  \n\nThe strange features were captured on a series of \nimages intended to monitor cloud changes in the background.  \n\nImages taken just \n<a href=\"image/0412/strangebefore_pryde_big.jpg\">before</a> and \n<a href=\"image/0412/strangeafter_pryde_big.jpg\">after</a> the above frame \nshow no <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,11480527%255E13569,00.html\">streak or flash</a>.  \n\nThe light pole near the flash has been inspected and \ndoes not show any damage, although the light inside was not working. \n\nIf you think you know what is going on, instead of sending us email\nplease participate in an \n<a href=\"http://nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?t=249\">online discussion</a>. \n\nIf a convincing argument or consensus is reached, the answer \nwill be posted on APOD at a later date.",
