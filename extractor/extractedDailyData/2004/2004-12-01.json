  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes the bright streaks on Dione?  \n\nRecent and likely future images of this unusual moon by the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> \nmight help us find out.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06528\">above image</a> was taken at the end of October from a distance of about one million kilometers.\n\nThe bright streaks run across some of Dione's many craters, indicating that the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1984Icar...59..205M\">process</a> that created them occurred later than the \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">impacts</a> that created those craters. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.solarviews.com/eng/dione.htm\">Dione</a> \nis made of mostly water ice but its relatively high density \nindicates that it contains much rock inside. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/Bios/cassini.html\">Giovanni Cassini</a> discovered Dione in 1684. \n\nThe Cassini spacecraft is scheduled to photograph Dione \nat higher resolution in mid-December.  \n\nCurrently, the \n<a href=\"ap951009.html\">highest resolution image</a>s of \nDione remain those taken by the passing \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html\">Voyager spacecraft</a> in 1980.",
