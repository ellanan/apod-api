  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOver one year after its launch,\n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/\nstatus_opportunity.html\">robot geologist Opportunity</a>\nhas been spending recent sols on Mars\ninching its way down the slopes of\n<a href=\"ap040510.html\">Endurance crater</a>.\n\nLittered with <a href=\"ap040405.html\">martian blueberries</a>,\nsome flat rocks within the crater also seem to have\n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/\nopportunity/20040716a.html\">surprising razorbacks</a> -- narrow\nslabs sticking up along their edges.\n\nLike the blueberries, it's possible that the sharp, narrow\nfeatures are related to water.\n\nThey could be\nformed by minerals deposited by water in cracks, with\nthe surrounding softer material subsequently eroded away.\n\nHow narrow are they?\n\nThe ones pictured here in\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06692\">an\nenhanced color image</a> from\n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/\nopportunity.html\">Opportunity's</a> panoramic camera are\nactually only a few centimeters high and about half\na centimeter wide.\n\nImpressive <a href=\"lib/razorback_anaglyphs.html\">3D\nviews</a> have been constructed by stereo experimenter\nP. Vantuyne based on the camera's left and right eye\nimages of the region.",
