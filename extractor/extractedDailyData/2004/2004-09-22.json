  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIs it art?  \n\nHere the paintbrush was the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/\">Spirit robotic rover</a>, \nthe canvas was the \n<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3519998.stm\">soil on Mars</a>, \nand the <a href=\"ap030315.html\">artists</a> were the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/people/\">scientists and engineers</a> \nof the Mars Exploration Rover Mission.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06870\">picture</a> created was mostly unintentional -- the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/\">MERS</a> \nteam was primarily instructing Spirit to investigate rocks \nin and around \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=670\">Hank's Hollow</a> in a location called \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=683\">Engineering Flats</a> on Mars. \n\nAfter creating the ground display with its treads, the \n<a href=\"ap040104.html\">Spirit</a> rover was instructed to \nphotograph the area along with itself in \n<a href=\"ap040803.html\">silhouette</a>.  \n\nBoth Mars rovers, \n<a href=\"ap040318.html\">Spirit</a> and \n<a href=\"ap030922.html\">Opportunity</a>, are now back in contact \nafter an expected \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-234\">radio blackout</a> caused by Mars moving behind the Sun.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> has also \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-234\">announced</a> that it is extending the rovers missions \nfor six months, so long as they keep working.",
