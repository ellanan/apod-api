  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSome patches of Mars are full of mysterious tiny \n<a href=\"ap040210.html\">spherules</a>.  \n\nThe microscopic imager on board the Opportunity rover on Mars recorded,\nlast week, the\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05273\">above\nimage</a> showing over a dozen.  \n\nThe image was taken near a rock outcrop called \n<a href=\"ap040210.html\">Stone Mountain</a> \nand spans roughly 6 centimeters across.  \n\nA typical diameter for one of the \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05286\">pictured spherules</a> is only about 4 millimeters, \nroughly the size of a small \n<a href=\"http://www.wildblueberries.net/bluehistory.html\">blueberry</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap040206.html\">spherules</a> \nappear to be much grayer and harder than surrounding rock.  \n\nDebate rages on the origin of the \n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/opportunity_update_040209.html\">tiny spherules</a>, \nand whether their shape has to do with a \n<a href=\"http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/geodes.htm\">slow accumulation of sediments</a> suspended in water, or \n<a href=\"ap040215.html\">flash-frozen rock</a> expelled during a \n<a href=\"ap010513.html\">meteor impact</a> or volcanic eruption.  \n\nA layered spherule, if ever found, would favor a water-based origin.  \n\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html\">Opportunity</a> is being programmed to \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20040214a.html\">dig</a> into the Martian surface of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/22jan_meridianiplanum.htm\">Meridiani Planum</a> to see what is there.",
