  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe Milky Way is an <a href=\"ap040701.html\">ordinary</a>\n12 billion year old spiral galaxy, and even our\nmiddle-aged Sun is pushing 4.5 billion years.\n\nBut <i>all</i> the stars in dwarf\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2004/35/\">galaxy I Zwicky 18</a> are\nmuch younger.\n\nIn fact, based on Hubble Space Telescope image data,\nthat galaxy's first stars formed only\nabout 500 million years ago, making it\nthe youngest known galaxy. \n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2004/35/image/a\">In this view</a>, the bright knots\nare the two major <a href=\"ap040205.html\">star forming</a>\nregions of I\n<a href=\"http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept02/\nZwicky/frames.html\">Zwicky</a> 18, embedded in expanding\nfilaments of glowing interstellar gas.\n\nScattered, much older background galaxies are seen as small\nred blobs, and a companion galaxy lies just beyond the\nupper right corner of the cropped picture.\n\nAstronomers believe that\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408391\">diminutive\nI Zwicky 18</a> resembles the earliest galaxies formed, but also\nwant to understand how such a young galaxy can be\nonly 45 million light-years away - surrounded by\nmature galaxies in an <a href=\"ap031231.html\">aging Universe</a>.\n\nThe tiny galaxy itself is a mere 3,000 light-years\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2004/35/fastfacts/\">across</a>.",
