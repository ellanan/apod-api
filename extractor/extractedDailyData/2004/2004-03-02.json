  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTen thousand years ago, before the dawn of <a href=\"\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_334000/334517.stm\">recorded human history</a>, \na new light must suddenly have appeared in the \nnight sky and faded after a few weeks.  \n\nToday we know this light was an <a href=\"\nhttp://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/supernovae.html\">exploding star</a> and record the colorful expanding cloud as the \n<a href=\"ap010928.html\">Veil Nebula</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0852.html\">Pictured above</a> is the west end of the \n<a href=\"ap030204.html\">Veil Nebula</a> known technically as \n<a href=\"http://www.ngcic.com/dss/dss_images.htm\">NGC</a> 6960 but less formally as the \n<a href=\"ap031229.html\">Witch</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.broomshop.com/history/\">Broom</a> Nebula.  \n\nThe rampaging gas gains its colors by impacting and \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/cygnusx.html\">exciting existing</a> nearby gas. \n\nThe <a href=\"supernova_remnants.html\">supernova remnant</a> \nlies about 1400 <a href=\"\nhttp://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light-years</a> away towards the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.multimania.com/cdadfs/constellation/cygne/cygnus.htm\">Cygnus</a>.  \n\nThis Witch's Broom actually spans over three times the \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/YBA/HTCas-size/more-ang_size.html\">angular size</a> of the full\n<a href=\"ap030810.html\">Moon</a>.  \n\nThe bright star 52 \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/cygnus.html\">Cygnus</a> is visible with the unaided eye from \na dark location but unrelated to the ancient \n<a href=\"http://www.chapman.edu/oca/benet/intro_sn.htm\">supernova</a>.",
