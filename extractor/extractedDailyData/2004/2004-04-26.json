  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow could a galaxy become shaped like a ring?  The rim of the blue galaxy \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/15/caption.html\">pictured</a> on the right is an immense ring-like structure 150,000 \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, \nmassive stars.  \n\nThat galaxy, <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997ApJ...474..686H\">AM 0644-741</a>, is known as a \n<a href=\"ap010612.html\">ring galaxy</a> and was caused by an \nimmense galaxy collision.  \n\nWhen <a href=\"ap020506.html\">galaxies collide</a>, \nthey pass through each other -- their individual stars \nrarely come into contact.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.engagement-rings-guide.com/engagement-rings-history.html\">ring</a>-like shape is the result of the \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.umd.edu/~dcr/Research/tidal.html\">gravitational disruption</a> \ncaused by an entire small intruder galaxy passing through a large one.  \n\nWhen this happens, interstellar gas and \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> become condensed, causing a \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/askexpert_question.cfm?articleID=0008A68A-8C7F-1C72-9EB7809EC588F2D7\">wave of star formation</a> \nto move out from the impact point like a \nripple across the surface of a pond.  \n\nThe intruder galaxy has since moved out of the frame taken by the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and released to <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/15/image/a\">commemorate</a> last Saturday's fourteenth anniversary of Hubble's launch.  \n\n<a href=\"ap020909.html\">Ring galaxy</a> AM 0644-741 lies about 300 million light years away.",
