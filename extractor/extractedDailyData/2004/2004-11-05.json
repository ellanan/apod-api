  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nGamma rays are the most energetic\n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/index.html\">form of light</a>.\n\nWith up to a billion times the energy of ordinary \"medical\"\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory1_xray.html\">x-rays</a>,\nthey easily penetrate telescope lenses and mirrors, making it\nvery difficult to create\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nhistory_gamma.html\">gamma-ray</a> images of cosmic sources.\n\nStill, an array of <a href=\"ap020906.html\">large telescopes</a>\ndesigned to detect gamma-ray\ninduced atmospheric flashes - the HESS\n(<a href=\"http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/HESS.html\">High Energy\nStereoscopic System</a>)\nexperiment - has produced this historic, resolved image of a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nsupernovas.html\">supernova remnant</a> at extreme\n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/epo/vu/\">gamma-ray energies</a>.\n\nAstronomers note that the\n<a href=\"http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/Md/Artcl/SNR_HESS.asp\">premier\ngamma-ray view</a> of the expanding\nstellar debris cloud is clearly similar to x-ray images of the remnant\nand <a href=\"http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/public/\nnature02960.pdf\">convincingly supports</a> the idea\nthat these sites of powerful\nshock waves are also sources of <a href=\"ap001202.html\">cosmic\nrays</a> within our galaxy.\n\nThe gamma-ray intensity is color-coded in the picture, shown with\ndark contour lines that trace levels of x-ray emission\nfrom the object.\n\nAt an estimated distance of 3,000 light-years, the supernova\nremnant measures about 50 light-years across and\nlies near the galactic plane.",
