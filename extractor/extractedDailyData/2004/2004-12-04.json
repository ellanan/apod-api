  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn the well known \n<a href=\"http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/~gibson/pleiades/\">Pleiades</a> \n<a href=\"open_clusters.html\">star cluster</a>, \na star's light is slowly destroying this wandering cloud of gas and \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a>. \n\nAbove, the star\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/\nm045_merope.html\">Merope</a> lies just off the upper left edge\nof <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2000/36/index.html\">this picture</a>\nfrom the \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. \n\nThe cloud, known as \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m045_i349.html\">IC 349</a>,\nand the star have been in existence for millions of years.  \n\nIn the past 100,000 years, however, part of the \ncloud has by chance moved so close to the star - \nonly 3,500 times the Earth-Sun distance - \nthat the starlight itself is having a very\ndramatic effect.\n\nPressure of the star's light significantly repels the dust in the \n<a href=\"reflection_nebulae.html\">reflection nebula</a>\nwith smaller dust particles being repelled more strongly.  \n\nEventually parts of the dust cloud have become \nstratified and point toward \n<a href=\"ap990301.html\">Merope</a>, \nwith the closest particles being the most \nmassive and so the least affected by the \n<a href=\"http://www.treasure-troves.com/physics/\nRadiationPressure.html\">radiation pressure</a>.  \n\nA longer-term result will be the \ngeneral destruction of the dust by the \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/uv.html\">energetic starlight</a>.",
