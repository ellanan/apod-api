  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat would it be like to climb a hill and look out over Mars?  \n\nThat opportunity was afforded the \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/\">Spirit rover</a> \nearlier this month as it rolled to a \n<a href=\"ap030831.html\">high perch</a> in the \n<a href=\"ap040628.html\">Columbia Hills</a>.  \n\nPeering out, the rolling robot \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06770\">spied</a> the interior plains and distant rim of \n<a href=\"ap020627.html\">Gusev Crater</a>, \nbeyond an outcrop of rocks called \n<a href=\"http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/texaslonghorn/\">Longhorn</a>. \n\nSpirit continues to find evidence that many rock shapes have been \n<a href=\"http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5749872/\">altered by ancient water</a>.  \n\nBoth Spirit and her sister robot \n<a href=\"ap040803.html\">Opportunity</a> have \n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040428a.html\">completed their primary three-month mission</a> but \nremain in good enough condition to continue to \n<a href=\"ap040127.html\">explore Mars</a>.",
