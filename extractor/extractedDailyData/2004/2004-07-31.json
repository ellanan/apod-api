  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHow often does a full moon occur twice in a single month? \n\nExactly once in a \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/article_377_1.asp\">Blue Moon</a>. \n\nIn fact, the modern usage of the term \"Blue Moon\" refers to the \nsecond Full Moon in a single month.  \n\nTonight's <a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/article_127_1.asp\">Blue Moon</a> will be the first since November 2001. \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bluemoon1.html\">Blue Moon</a> typically occurs every few years. \n\nThe reason for the rarity of the \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/07jul_bluemoon.htm\">Blue Moon</a> is that the 29.53 days between full moons is \njust slightly shorter than the number of days in the average month. \n\nDon't, however, expect the moon to look blue tonight!  \n\nThe term \"<a href=\"http://spaceweather.com/glossary/bluemoonstories.html\">Blue Moon</a>\" has recently been traced to an error in a \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1310_1.asp\">magazine article</a> in 1946.  \n\nIt is possible for the \n<a href=\"ap030810.html\">Moon</a> to appear tinged by a blue hue, sometimes caused by fine dirt circulating in the \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, possibly from a volcanic explosion. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.icstars.com/Ushop/imagepages/MoonJup.html\">above picture</a> was taken not during a full moon but through a morning sky that appeared dark blue.  \n\nThe bright crescent is the only part directly exposed to sunlight - the rest of the <a href=\"ap031004.html\">Moon glows</a> from sunlight reflected from the Earth. \n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.icstars.com/Ushop/imagepages/MoonJup.html\">this dramatic photo</a>, however, the planet \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a> \nis also visible along with its \n<a href=\"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/jupiter_satellites.html\">four largest moons</a>.",
