  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhy don't these pieces fit?\n\nThis third quarter Moon (left) and first quarter Moon were\nboth photographed during the last lunar cycle or\n<a href=\"ap040829.html\">lunation</a> with the\nsame telescope and camera.\n\nBut, simply combining the pictures into one sharp, full\n<a href=\"http://astrosurf.com/cidadao/moon.htm\">surface view</a>\nwould clearly be a problem.\n\nIn fact, on October 6th the Moon's third quarter phase\nhappened to occur near\n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/moon_ap_per.html\">lunar\napogee</a>, the farthest point in the Moon's\n<a href=\"http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf3-4.html\">orbit</a>.\n\nOn September 21st, the first quarter phase fell close to\n<a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html\">lunar\nperigee</a>, the Moon's closest approach to planet Earth.\n\nViewed two weeks apart,\nthe resulting difference in apparent sizes would not be\nnoticed by casual <a href=\"ap030515.html\">skygazers</a>, but the\nsimultaneous side by side comparison makes it hard to ignore.\n\nSkygazers will likely\n<a href=\"http://www.shadowandsubstance.com/\">notice the Moon</a>\nnext week though,\nas it slides through Earth's shadow during October 27th's\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/\n13oct_lunareclipse.htm\">total lunar eclipse</a>.",
