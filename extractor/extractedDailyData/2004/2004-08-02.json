  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nImagine a pipe as wide as a state and as long as half the Earth.  \n\nNow imagine that this pipe is filled with \n<a href=\"ap970904.html\">hot gas moving</a> 50,000 kilometers per hour.  \n\nFurther imagine that this pipe is not made of metal but a transparent \n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/Magnetic/\">magnetic field</a>.  \n\nYou are envisioning just one of thousands of young \nspicules on the \n<a href=\"ap980515.html\">active Sun</a>.  \n\nPictured above is perhaps the highest \nresolution image yet of these enigmatic solar flux tubes.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/star_quakes_40728.html\">Spicules</a> dot the \n<a href=\"http://www.lmsal.com/Press/spicules2004/\">above frame</a> of \nsolar active region 10380 that crossed the Sun in June, \nbut are particularly evident as a \n<a href=\"ap991024.html\">carpet</a> of dark tubes on the right.  \n\nTime-sequenced images have recently shown that \n<a href=\"ap040611.html\">spicules</a> last about five minutes, \nstarting out as tall tubes of rapidly rising gas but eventually \nfading as the gas peaks and falls back down to the Sun.  \n\nThese images also indicate, for the first time, that the ultimate cause of \n<a href=\"http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/SunInfo/spicules.html\">spicules</a> is sound-like waves that flow over the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a>'s \nsurface but leak into the \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a><a>'s atmosphere.\n\n</a>",
