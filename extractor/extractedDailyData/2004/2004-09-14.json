  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA flying saucer from outer space crash-landed in the Utah desert \nlast week after being tracked by radar and chased by helicopters.  \n\nNo <a href=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SFafter1940.html\">space aliens</a> were involved, however.  \n\nThe saucer, \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/genesis/multimedia/genesisrecov090804-2.html\">pictured above</a>, was the Genesis sample return capsule, \npart of a human-made robot \n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=635\">Genesis spaceship</a> launched three years ago by NASA \nitself to study the Sun.  \n\nThe unexpectedly \n<a href=\"http://www.genesismission.org/mission/status_report.html\">hard landing</a> at over 300 kilometers per hour occurred because the \nparachutes did not open as planned.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.genesismission.org/science/module4_solarmax/index.html\">Genesis mission</a> had been orbiting the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a> collecting \n<a href=\"ap970217.html\">solar wind</a> particles that are \nusually deflected away by \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/magnetic.html\">Earth's magnetic field</a>. \n\nA big question remains -- are the returned samples in \ngood enough condition to recover information about the real \n<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/suncomp.html\">composition of the Sun</a>?  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.genesismission.org/people/index.html\">Genesis team</a> scientists and engineers are working hard to \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/genesis/main/index.html\">find out</a>.",
