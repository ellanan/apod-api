  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAn unusual type of solar eclipse occurred last week.  \n\nUsually it is the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html\">Earth's Moon</a> that \n<a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/eclipse.html\">eclipses</a> \nthe Sun.  \n\nLast week, for the first time in over 100 years, the planet \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html\">Venus</a> took a turn.  \n\nLike a <a href=\"ap010408.html\">solar eclipse</a> by the Moon, the <a href=\"http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/venus_phase.htm\">phase of Venus</a> became a continually thinner \n<a href=\"ap010619.html\">crescent</a> as Venus became increasingly \nbetter aligned with the Sun.  \n\nEventually the alignment became perfect and the \n<a href=\"ap030810.html\">phase</a> of Venus dropped to zero.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap040609.html\">dark spot</a> of Venus crossed our parent star.  \n\nThe situation could technically be labeled a Venusian \n<a href=\"http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html\">annular eclipse</a> with an extraordinarily large \n<a href=\"ap020610.html\">ring of fire</a>.  \n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.pbl33.fast24.co.uk/\">above</a> the \n<a href=\"ap040516.html\">thick cloud tops of Venus</a>, \nthe Earth appeared in its fullest phase, brighter in the \nVenusian sky than even \n<a href=\"ap030902.html\">Mars appeared</a> from Earth last August.  \n\nHours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, \na slight crescent phase appeared again. \n\nThe next <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/venustransit/gallery_08jun04.htm\">Venusian solar eclipse</a> will occur in 2012.",
