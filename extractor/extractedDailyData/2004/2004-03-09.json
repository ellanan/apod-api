  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat did the first galaxies look like?\n\nTo help answer this question, the Hubble Space Telescope has just finished taking the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/07/\">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> (HUDF), the deepest image of the \nuniverse ever taken in \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/visible.html\">visible light</a>.  \n\nPictured above, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3387919.stm\">HUDF</a> shows a sampling of the \n<a href=\"ap040217.html\">oldest galaxies</a> ever seen, \ngalaxies that formed just after the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003Sci...300.1904M\">dark ages</a>, 13 billion years ago, when the universe was \nonly 5 percent of its present age.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos\">NICMOS</a> and new \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/\">ACS</a> cameras took the image.  \n\nStaring nearly 3 months at the same spot, the \n<a href=\"http://sco.stsci.edu/newsletter/PDF/2003/fall_03.pdf\">HUDF</a> is four times more sensitive, in some colors, \nthan the original <a href=\"ap020901.html\">Hubble Deep Field</a> (HDF).\n\nAstronomers the world over will likely study the \n<a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/stsci/hubbledev/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/07/text/index.html\">HUDF</a> for years to come to\nbetter understand how stars and galaxies formed in the early universe.",
