  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMany think it is just a <a href=\"http://www.mythweb.com\">myth</a>.  \n\nOthers think it is true but its cause isn't known.  \nAdventurers pride themselves on having seen it.  \n\nIt's a <a href=\"http://www.exo.net/~pauld/physics/atmospheric_optics/green_flash.html\">green flash</a> from the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a>.  \n\nThe truth is the \n<a href=\"http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/\">green flash</a> \ndoes exist and its cause is well understood.  \n\nJust as the setting \n<a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> disappears completely from view, \na last glimmer appears startlingly \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green\">green</a>.  \n\nThe effect is typically visible only from locations with a low, \ndistant horizon, and lasts just a few seconds. \n\nA <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html\">green flash</a> is also visible for a rising \n<a href=\"ap011109.html\">Sun</a>, but takes better timing to spot.  \n\nA dramatic green flash was caught in the \n<a href=\"http://www.polarimage.fi/sun/su09654b.jpg\">above photograph</a> in 1992 from \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fi.html\">Finland</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap970108.html\">Sun</a> itself does <i> not </i> turn \npartly green, the effect is caused by layers of the \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blue.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> acting like a <a href=\"http://www.btinternet.com/~k.trethewey/how_do_lenses_and_prisms_work.htm\">prism</a>.",
