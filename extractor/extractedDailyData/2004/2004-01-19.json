  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nFlying past a \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/comets.html\">comet</a> \nnucleus is dangerous.  \n\nOn January 2, the \n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft.html\">robot spacecraft STARDUST</a> became \n<a href=\"ap000805.html\">one of</a> \n<a href=\"ap010926.html\">the first</a> to \nplow through the \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/coma.html\">surrounding cloud</a> of dust and grit to \n<a href=\"ap040103.html\">photograph</a> the very \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/coma.html\">heart</a> of a comet.  \n\n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/status/040106.html\">Pictured above</a> is a short movie of the encounter \nshowing unprecedented surface details of the icy center of \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast04feb99_1.htm\">Comet Wild 2</a>.  \n\nThe STARDUST camera pivoted to remain \npointed at the nucleus as the spacecraft passed.  \n\nHeavily <a href=\"http://hitf.jsc.nasa.gov/hitfpub/analysis/stardust2.html\">shielded</a> from the onslaught of \n<a href=\"ap011117.html\">cometary debris</a>, \nSTARDUST survived the beating in excellent condition.  \n\nSurprisingly, although the nucleus appeared to be solid, the\nthe surrounding <a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/coma.html\">coma</a> appeared to be highly fragmented into \nseveral distinct streams of particles.  \n\nSouvenirs captured by the spacecraft will be \n<a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/details.html\">ejected</a> as the spacecraft passes the Earth in January 2006.",
