  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSprawling across hundreds of light-years, emission\n<a href=\"http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/nebulae/\nic1805.html\">nebula IC 1805</a> is a mix of glowing\ninterstellar gas and dark dust clouds.\n\nOnly about 7,500 light-years away,\n<a href=\"ap040916.html\">stars were born</a> in this region\nwhose nickname -\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosurf.com/lorenzi/images/heart.htm\">the\nHeart Nebula</a> - derives from its suggestive\nshape (seen here sideways).\n\nThis gorgeous,\n<a href=\"http://www.narrowbandimaging.com/\nic1805_fsq_6303_s2hao3_page.htm\">deep telescopic image</a>\nof the nebula is very colorful, but if you could travel\nthere and gaze across these cosmic clouds with your own eyes,\nare those the colors you would really see?\n\nThe short answer is no, even though the image was made\nwith <a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/\nvisible.html\">light visible</a> to\n<a href=\"http://home.wanadoo.nl/paulschils/05.00.html\">the human eye</a>.\n\nLight from this and other glowing gas clouds\nsurrounding hot, young stars comes in very narrow bands of\nemission characteristic of\n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/\nabsorption.html\">energized atoms</a> within the clouds.\n\nIn fact, the nebular glow is often dominated by\nhydrogen atoms emitting light in only a\n<a href=\"http://www.novac.com/solar/solar5.htm\">small fraction</a>\nof that broad region of the spectrum that\nwe see as the color red.\n\nAdopting an\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/behind_the_pictures/\nmeaning_of_color/eagle.shtml\">artificial color</a> scheme\ncommonly used for narrow band images of\n<a href=\"http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/\nNebula/Emission.html\">emission nebulae</a>, this\nbeautifully detailed view shows the light\nfrom sulfur atoms in red hues, with hydrogen in green,\nand oxygen atoms in blue.",
