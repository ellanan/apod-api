  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would a cloud appear to be different colors?  \n\nA relatively rare phenomenon known as \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/droplets/irid1.htm\">iridescent clouds</a> can show unusual colors vividly or a whole \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html\">spectrum</a> of colors simultaneously.  \n\nThese <a href=\"http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/weather/pricloud/\">clouds</a> are formed of small \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm\">water droplets</a> of nearly uniform size.  \n\nWhen the <a href=\"sun.html\">Sun</a> is in the \nright position and mostly hidden by thick clouds, \n\n<a href=\"http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/class/iredsnce.html\">these thinner clouds</a> significantly \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction.html\">diffract</a> sunlight in a nearly coherent manner, \nwith different colors being deflected by different amounts.  \n\nTherefore, different colors will come to the observer \nfrom slightly different directions. \n\nMany clouds start with uniform regions that could show \n<a href=\"http://www.meteoros.de/iris/irise.htm\">iridescence</a> but quickly become too thick, too mixed, \nor too far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors.\n\nPictured above, an iridescent cloud was photographed near Cannes,  \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html\">France</a> last month.",
