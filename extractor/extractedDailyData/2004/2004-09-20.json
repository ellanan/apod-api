  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nAre Saturn's rings transparent?  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/index.cfm\">Cassini spacecraft</a> that recently entered orbit around \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> \nhas confirmed that some of \n<a href=\"ap040723.html\">Saturn's rings</a> \nare more transparent than others.  \n\n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06114\">Pictured above</a>, Saturn's main \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/saturn/rings.html\">A, B, and C rings</a> can be seen, top to bottom, \nsuperposed against the gas giant planet. \n\nAlthough the B-ring across the top is opaque, Saturn's <a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/saturn/atmosphere/S_clouds_overview.html\">cloud tops</a> can be clearly seen through the lower C-ring.  \n\nThe translucent nature of the \n<a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=1567\">C-ring</a> likely indicates that it is less densely populated with ring particles than the B-ring.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-releases-04/20040916-pr-a.cfm\">above image</a> was taken on July 30 while Cassini was over 7 million kilometers from Saturn.",
