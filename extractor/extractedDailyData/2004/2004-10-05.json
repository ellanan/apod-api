  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nHuman space flight has entered the domain of private companies.  \n\nPreviously, large countries like the \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">US</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rs.html\">Russia</a> have hired privately owned civilian \ncompanies to do specific tasks in support of their \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">public</a> human \n<a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/\">space flight</a> programs.  \n\nYesterday, however, the solely corporate \n<a href=\"ap030627.html\">SpaceShipOne</a> soared 100 kilometers \nabove the Earth for the second time in two weeks to claim the coveted $10 million dollar \n<a href=\"http://www.xprize.org/\">X-Prize</a> put forward by Ansari to inspire private space flight development.  \n\nThe X-prize was modeled after the \n<a href=\"http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/orteig.asp\">Orteig prize</a> that was designed to inspire \nocean-crossing airplane flights and won by \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lindberg\">Charles Lindbergh</a> in 1927.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/oct/HQ_04329_SpaceShipOne.html\">impressive success</a> of \n<a href=\"ap040625.html\">SpaceShipOne</a>, designed by a team led by engineer \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Rutan\">Burt Rutan</a>, could usher in a new age of inexpensive \ncommercial space flights that includes \n<a href=\"http://aerospacescholars.jsc.nasa.gov/HAS/cirr/em/8/5.cfm\">space tourism</a> and an increased presence of humans in space.  \n\nScaled Composite's SpaceShipOne is \n<a href=\"http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/gallery/flight_general?page=5\">pictured</a> soaring high above the Earth in a \npractice run last December.",
