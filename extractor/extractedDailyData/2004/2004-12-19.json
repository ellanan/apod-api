  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhere did all the stars go?  \nWhat used to be considered a hole in the sky \nis now known to astronomers as a dark <a href=\"\nhttp://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/MolecularCloud.html\">molecular cloud</a>.  \n\nHere, a high concentration of \n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> and \n<a href=\"ap970430.html\">molecular gas</a> \nabsorb practically all the visible light \nemitted from background stars.\n  \nThe eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors of \n<a href=\"http://etacha.as.arizona.edu/~eem/ttau/gmc.html\">molecular clouds</a> some of the coldest \nand most isolated places in the universe.  \n\nOne of the most notable of these \n<a href=\"dark_nebulae.html\">dark absorption nebulae</a> \nis a cloud toward the constellation \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/ophiuchus.html\">Ophiuchus</a> known as Barnard 68, \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/phot-20-99.html\">pictured above</a>.  \n\nThat no stars are visible in the center indicates that \n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/virtualmuseum/Barnard.html\">Barnard</a> 68 is relatively nearby, \nwith measurements placing it about \n500 light-years away and half a <a href=\"\nhttp://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html\">light-year</a> across.  \n\nIt is not known exactly how \n<a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/GMC.html\">molecular clouds</a> like \n<a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=597\">Barnard 68</a> form, but it is known that these clouds are themselves \n<a href=\"ap031026.html\">likely places</a> \nfor <a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec14.html\">new stars to form</a>.\n\nIt is possible to \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/phot-29-99.html\">look right through</a> the cloud in <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/discovery.html\">infrared</a> light.",
