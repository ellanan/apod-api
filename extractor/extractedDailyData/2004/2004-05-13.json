  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nA distinctive X-shape and ladder-like rungs appear in\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/\nreleases/2004/11/image/a\">this Hubble Space Telescope</a>\nimage of the intriguing\n<a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/AAO/images/captions/\naat094.html\">Red Rectangle Nebula</a>.\n\nThe dusty cosmic cloud was originally identified as\na strong source of\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/\">infrared\nradiation</a> and is now\nbelieved to contain icy dust grains and hydrocarbon\nmolecules formed in the cool outflow from an aging\ncentral star.\n\nSo why does it look like a big X?\n\nA likely <a href=\"http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/\ncdsbib?2004AJ....127.2362C\">explanation is</a> that the\ncentral star - actually a close pair of stars - is surrounded by\na thick dust torus which pinches the otherwise spherical\noutflow into tip-touching cone shapes.\n\nBecause we view the torus edge-on, the boundary edges of\n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/2004/11/images/\nb/formats/web_print.jpg\">the cone shapes</a> seem to form an X.\n\nThe distinct rungs suggest the outflow occurs in\nfits and starts.\n\nAbout 2,300 light-years away toward the fanciful constellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/mon/index.html\">Monoceros</a>,\nthe Red Rectangle nebula should be transformed\ninto a glorious <a href=\"ap040505.html\">planetary nebula</a>\nas its cool central star becomes a\n<a href=\"ap000910.html\">hot white dwarf</a> over\nthe next few thousand years.\n\nThis sharp Hubble picture spans only about one third of a light-year\nat the distance of the Red Rectangle.",
