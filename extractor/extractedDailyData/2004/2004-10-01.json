  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nOn Wednesday, September 29, the Earth came within one million\nmiles of the\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosurf.com/maury/asteroides/toutatis.html\">asteroid\nToutatis</a> -- the closest predicted\naproach of our fair planet to a  sizable asteroid or comet in this\ncentury.\n\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news144.html\">Coming within</a>\none million miles or about 4 times the Earth-Moon\ndistance, Earth would appear to be nearly the size of the full\nmoon in the asteroid's sky, as suggested in this illustration.\n\nIn Earth's sky,\n<a href=\"http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/4179_Toutatis/\ntoutatis.html\">Toutatis appeared</a>\nonly as a faint object rapidly moving against a\nbackground of stars.\n\nAlso known as Earth-crossing\n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~hudson/Research/\nAsteroids/4179/\">asteroid 4179</a>,\nToutatis is in an eccentric 4 year orbit\nwhich moves it from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter to just\ninside Earth's orbit.\n\nWhen the Earth passed near it\nin 1992 Toutatis was <a href=\"http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/\">imaged\nby radar</a> and seen to be two irregularly shaped lumps,\nperhaps joined by a narrow neck. \n\nThis bizarre object is up to 1.5 miles wide, 3 miles long, and is\ntumbling through space.\n\nStudies of Toutatis and other \nEarth-crossing asteroids help reveal\nconnections between the\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/\">Solar System's</a>\nmeteorites, main-belt asteroids and comets.\n\nThese asteroids also offer tantalizing\n<a href=\"ap030301.html\">targets for robotic\nexploration</a> and, over time, represent\n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/\">potential collision hazards</a>\nfor planet Earth!",
