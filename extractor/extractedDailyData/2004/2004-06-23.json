  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe rare\n<a href=\"ap040608.html\">transit of Venus</a> across the face of the Sun earlier this month was one of the better-photographed events in sky history.  \n\nBoth scientific and artistic <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/venustransit/gallery_08jun04.htm\">images have been flooding in</a> from the areas that could see the transit: Europe and much of Asia, Africa, and North America.  \n\nScientifically, solar photographers confirmed that the \n<a href=\"http://www.transitofvenus.org/blackdrop.htm\">black drop effect</a> \nis really better <a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1277_1.asp\">related</a> to the viewing clarity of the camera or telescope than the atmosphere of <a href=\"ap040610.html\">Venus</a>. \n\nArtistically, images might be divided into several categories.  \n\nOne type captures the \n<a href=\"ap040611.html\">transit in front of a highly detailed Sun</a>.  \n\nAnother category captures a double coincidence such as both <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/venustransit/gallery_08jun04_page2.htm\">Venus and an airplane</a> simultaneously silhouetted, or <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/venustransit/gallery_08jun04_page14.htm\">Venus and the International Space Station</a> in low Earth orbit.\n\nA third image type involves a fortuitous arrangement of interesting looking clouds, as shown by example in the \n<a href=\"http://www.davidcortner.com/astro/vtransit/\">above image</a> \ntaken from \n<a href=\"www.state.nc.us/\">North Carolina</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.\n\nThere the distant orb of giant \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html\">Venus</a> might have been mistaken, at first glance, for a small but unusually circular cloud.",
