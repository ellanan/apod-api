  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat could rip a star apart?  \n\nA <a href=\"http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/abholes.html\">black hole</a>.  \n\nGiant <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/black_holes.html\">black holes</a> in just the right mass range would \npull on the front of a closely passing star much more \nstrongly than on the back.  \n\nSuch a strong <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force\">tidal force</a> would stretch out a star and \nlikely cause some of the star's gasses to fall into the black hole.  \n\nThe <a href=\"ap010508.html\">infalling gas</a> has been predicted \nto emit just the same blast of \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/xrays.html\">X-rays</a> that have \n<a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402468\">recently been seen</a> in the center of galaxy \n<a href=\"http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/18feb_mayhem.htm\">RX J1242-11</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2004/rxj1242/more.html#4\">Above</a>, an artist's <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/illustrations/tidal_disruption.html\">illustration</a> depicts the \n<a href=\"http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/~skomossa/SSU_bg.html\">sequence of destruction</a> (assuming that \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html\">image-distorting gravitational-lens effects</a> of the \n<a href=\"ap020908.html\">black hole</a> are somehow turned off).  \n\nMost of the stellar remains would be flung out into the galaxy.  \n\nSuch events are rare, occurring perhaps only \none in 10,000 years for typical \n<a href=\"ap020309.html\">black holes</a> at the center of \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">typical galaxies</a>.",
