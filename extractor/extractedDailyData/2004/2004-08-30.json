  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA comet discovered last year has brightened unexpectedly and now may become visible to the unaided eye within the next month.  \n\nDesignated <a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2003k4.html\">Comet C/2003 K4 (LINEAR)</a>, the comet was discovered in \n2003 May by project \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/\">LINEAR</a>. \n\nMany <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#03K4\">reports</a> already place the comet as brighter than \n<a href=\"http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=569\">magnitude</a> 7, meaning that it can now be seen with binoculars. \n\nReports also indicate the comet already has a \n<a href=\"ap040314.html\">visible tail</a> nearly the length of a \n<a href=\"ap010906.html\">full Moon</a>. \n\nSince predicting the \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2003K4.html\">future brightness</a> of comets is a very \n<a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/exploring/space/kohoutek.html\">tricky business</a>, there remains the possibility that \nK4 might never become very bright. \n\nCurrent \n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2003K4/2003K4.html\">predictions</a>, however, estimate the comet may \napproach fifth magnitude in October.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.skyhound.com/sh/comets.html\">K4 passes</a> \nclosest to the Sun on October 12 and then closest to the Earth \non December 23.  \n\nComet K4 was photographed above from Van Buren, \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ar.us/\">Arkansas</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a> on August 17.",
