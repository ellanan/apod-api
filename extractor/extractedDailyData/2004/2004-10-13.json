  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nArtificial clouds made by humans may become \nso common they change the Earth's climate.  \n\nThe long thin cloud streaks that dominate the \n<a href=\"http://epod.usra.edu/archive/epodviewer.php3?oid=190208\">above satellite photograph</a> of \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ga.us/\">Georgia</a> are \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail\">contrails</a>, \n<a href=\"http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cld/cldtyp/hgh/crs.rxml\">cirrus clouds</a> created by airplanes.  \n\nThe \n\nexhaust of an airplane engine can create a \n<a href=\"ap031001.html\">contrail</a> by saturating the surrounding air with extra moisture.  The wings of a plane can similarly \n<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/aiaa/www/\">create contrails</a> \nby dropping the temperature and causing small ice-crystals to form.  \n\nContrails have become more than an oddity - they may be \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/apr/HQ_04140_clouds_climate.html\">significantly increasing the cloudiness</a> of Earth, \nreflecting sunlight back into space by day, and \n<a href=\"http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/globalwarmA5.html\">heat radiation</a> back to \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth even at night</a>.  \n\nThe effect on climate is a topic of much \n<a href=\"http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/prrl/prrl9919.html\">research</a>.  \n\nYou can <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Contrails_5-8.html\">help NASA</a> measure the actual abundance of contrails by participating in a \n<a href=\"http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/GLOBE/contrails/\">contrail</a> counting exercise that runs over the next two days.",
