  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n<a href=\"ap040427.html\">Comet Bradfield</a> \nis easy to see on the left, but can you find \n<a href=\"ap040422.html\">Comet LINEAR</a> on the right?  \n\nLast week, just before sunrise from the northern hemisphere, \n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1037_2.asp\">two bright comets</a> were visible in the \nsame part of the sky at the same time.  \n\nThe above long-exposure image was taken on the morning of April 25 from \n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/jotr/\">Joshua Tree National Park</a> in \n<a href=\"http://www.state.ca.us/\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"ap040419.html\">Comet C/2004 F4 (Bradfield)</a> \nis giving an unexpectedly good show as it recedes from the \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">Sun</a> and \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">Earth</a> and fades from view.  \n\nIts <a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/tail.html\">tail</a> is estimated by some to be about 10 \n<a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/trig/angle.html\">degrees</a> long.  \n\nHaving just rounded the Sun itself, \n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/lcomets/2002t7.html\">Comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR)</a> is now moving toward the Earth.   \n\nAlthough intrinsically fading, T7 will \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2002T7.html\">appear to brighten</a> until about mid-May and so \ncontinue to be visible to the unaided eye before \nsunrise to southern hemisphere observers into June.  \n\n<a href=\"ap040423.html\">Q4</a>, the third coincidental naked eye comet, \nwill become visible in mid-May to northern hemisphere observers.",
