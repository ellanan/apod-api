  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA comet \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=2465\">discovered only this summer</a> is brightening quickly and \nalready visible to the unaided eye.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/comet_machholz_041207.html\">Comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz)</a> is currently best visible in \nEarth's Southern Hemisphere where some \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/RecentObs.html#04Q2\">observers report</a> it brighter than \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 5.  \n\nThe comet is moving rapidly to northern skies and should\ncontinue to brighten until early January.  \n\nBy coincidence, \n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/charts.html\">Comet Machholz will be easy to view</a> as it will be nearly opposite the Sun\nwhen appearing its brightest.  \n\nHow <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/2004Q2.html\">bright Comet Machholz</a> will become then remains uncertain, \nbut it will surely stay in northern skies for much of 2005, even approaching \n<a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a> in early March.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/c-2004q2.html\">Pictured above</a>, Comet Machholz was captured in early December \nalready sporting a bright surrounding \n<a href=\"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/coma.html\">coma</a>, a white oblong \n<a href=\"http://www.il-st-acad-sci.org/planets/comets3.html\">dust tail</a> \nfading off toward the bottom, and a long \n<a href=\"ap020515.html\">wispy ion tail</a> toward the right \nwith a kink near the end.",
