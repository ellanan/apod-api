  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt isn't every day that planets line up behind a stone giant.  \n\nFor one thing, it helps to have a good \n<a href=\"ap040501.html\">planet line-up</a>, \nsuch as occurred in the sky just last month.\n\nFor another, it helps to be on \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/\">Easter Island</a>, where over 800 large stone statues exist.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/giants.html\">Easter Island statues</a>, stand, on the average, over \ntwice as tall as a person and have over 200 times as much mass.  \n\nFew specifics are known about the history or meaning of the \n<a href=\"http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/ioa/eisp/\">unusual statues</a>, \nbut many believe that they were created about \n500 years ago in the images of local leaders of a lost civilization.  \n\nPictured above, the \n<a href=\"ap030810.html\">Moon</a>, \n<a href=\"ap040516.html\">Venus</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> \ncan be seen behind \n\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/explore/ahutahai.html\">Ahu Tahai</a>, a famous Easter Island statue.  \n\nThe bright star \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/aldebaran.html\">Aldebaran</a> is also visible.",
