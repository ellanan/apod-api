  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhen did galaxies form?  \n\nFaint red smudges identified on the \n<a href=\"ap040309.html\">deepest optical sky image</a> \never taken may well be members of the first class of galaxies.  \n\nDetailed inspection of the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/07/\">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> (HUDF), taken by the \n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a> \non the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, \nfound the galaxies, circled <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/28/image/\">above</a>, and used their distance and abundance to \n<a href=\"ap040711.html\">probe the universe</a> \nwhen it was only a few percent of its present age.  \n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/28/text/\">Analyses indicate</a> that the discovered class of galaxies is exclusively composed of these smaller \n<a href=\"ap030727.html\">dwarf galaxies</a> from which larger \n<a href=\"ap040125.html\">modern galaxies</a> must have formed.  \n\nSome large modern galaxies make a colorful foreground to the above \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/udf/index_html\">HUDF</a>.  \n\nThe first class of dwarf galaxies likely contained \n<a href=\"ap030610.html\">energetic stars</a> emitting light that \n<a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rtnigm/reion/RTNreionization.html\">transformed</a> much of the remaining \n<a href=\"ap020820.html\">normal matter</a> in the universe from a cold gas to a hot \n<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/ionization.html\">ionized plasma</a>.",
