  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat causes storms on Saturn?  \n\nTo help find out, scientists commanded the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/index.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> \nto inspect a circulating band of clouds \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06507\">nicknamed \"Storm Alley.\"</a>  \n\nThis westwardly moving cloud ring has been unusually \nactive since the beginning of 2004, spawning \n<a href=\"ap951018.html\">white swirling storms</a> and \ndark storms ringed by sprawling white clouds all \ncascading around the gas giant.  \n\nThe rogue band, as well as other parts of \n<a href=\"ap041018.html\">south Saturn</a>, were \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06507\">imaged in \nstunning detail</a> in a very specific band of \n<a href=\"http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/infrared.html\">infrared light</a> that passes through Saturn's \n<a href=\"ap000429.html\">upper haze</a> relatively unblurred.  \n\nThe result was then digitally sharpened, showing more cloud detail \nbut creating fake image artifacts such as a surrounding ring.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003DPS....35.4504H\">Speculation</a> on the nature of past \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003DPS....35.4509S\">Saturn storms</a> included \n<a href=\"http://ethel.as.arizona.edu/~collins/astro/subjects/convection2.html\">convective</a> motions of small amounts of \n<a href=\"http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/owsat.htm\">ammonia and water</a>, seasons, and shadowing effects of the \n<a href=\"http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html\">great ring system</a>.  \n\nAlthough the above image provides data and clues, the power behind \n<a href=\"http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/saturn.htm\">Saturn</a>'s \nstorms still remains a mystery.",
