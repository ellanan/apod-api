  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhile searching the skies above 18th century France for comets,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/history/\nbiograph.html\">astronomer Charles Messier</a> diligently\nrecorded this object as number 27 on his list of things which are\n<a href=\"ap960626.html\">definitely not comets</a>.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nWell, 21st century astronomers would classify it as a\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html\">Planetary\nNebula</a> ...\nbut it's not a planet either, even though it may\n<a href=\"ap980518.html\">appear round</a>\nand planet-like in a small telescope.\n\nMessier 27 (M27) is now\nknown to be an excellent example of a\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/\">\ngaseous emission nebula</a> created\nas a <a href=\"ap040111.html\">sun-like star runs out</a>\nof nuclear fuel in its core.\n\nThe nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into\nspace.\n\nThe visible glow is generated as atoms are excited by the dying\nstar's intense but invisible\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/\nemspectrum.html\">ultraviolet light</a>.\n\nKnown by the popular name\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m027.html\">Dumbbell\nNebula</a>, the beautifully\nsymmetric interstellar gas cloud is about 1,200 light-years away in the\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vul/index.html\">constellation\nVulpecula</a>.\n\nThis\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/\nphot-38-98.html\">gorgeous synthetic color picture of M27</a>\nwas produced during testing of one of the European Southern Observatory's \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/gallery/vlt/images/Top20/\">Very\nLarge Telescopes</a>.",
