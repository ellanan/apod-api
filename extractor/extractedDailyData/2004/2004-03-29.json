  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nUsing oxygen from the air itself, a NASA experimental \njet propelled itself past Mach 7 in the atmosphere above \nthe Pacific Ocean this weekend.  \n\nThe small automated \n<a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/X-43A/HTML/index.html\">X-43A Hyper-X</a> craft was dropped from a huge converted \n<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=83\">B-52</a> bomber and then accelerated by a standard \n<a href=\"http://spaceplace.jpl.nasa.gov/galex/pegasus.html\">Pegasus rocket</a>.  \n\nAt Mach 7, seven times the \n<a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/sound.html\">speed of sound</a>, the X-43A separated and the novel \n<a href=\"http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/ramjet.htm\">scramjet</a> kicked in.  \n\nAtmospheric \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/8.html\">oxygen</a> was then scooped up, combined with onboard \n<a href=\"http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/1.html\">hydrogen</a>, and combusted in flight to propel the \n<a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Newsroom/ResearchUpdate/X43A/index.html\">X-43A</a> to record air speeds \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43_suc.html\">during maneuvers</a> over the next 10 seconds.  \n\nEngines of \n<a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/ramjet.html\">ramjet</a> design have been suggested as a \nsatellite launch method without heavy fuel tanks \nand even romanticized for \n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A600436\">interstellar space travel</a>.  \n\nThe previously acknowledged \n<a href=\"http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0023.shtml\">air-speed record</a> for jet-powered flight was \nMach 3.3 for the decommissioned \n<a href=\"http://www.sr-71.org/\">SR-71</a>.  \n\nRe-entering space rockets can start as high as \nMach 36 before the atmosphere decelerates them.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43-main.html\">X-43A</a>, depicted in the \n<a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/X-43A/Small/index.html\">artist's illustration above</a>, might well propel \nitself past Mach 10 in future tests.",
