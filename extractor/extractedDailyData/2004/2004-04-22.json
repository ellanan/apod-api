Koehn</a>)\nto the Sun tomorrow, April 23rd.\n\nEmerging from the solar glare, the\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/comets.html\">comet is</a>\nnow just visible to\nthe unaided eye in the constellation Pisces, near the eastern horizon\nin morning twilight.\n\nIn this\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/\nc-2002t7.html\">gorgeous telescopic view</a>\nrecorded before dawn\nyesterday, the clearly active comet has developed an extensive, complex\n<a href=\"ap000413.html\">tail extending</a> over 2 degrees in\nthe anti-sunward direction, and a pronounced\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/define.html\">anti-tail</a> or\nanomalous tail.\n\nLater next month this comet should appear brighter,\nmaking its closest approach to planet Earth on May 19th.\n\nIn fact, it could\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/\narticle_1037_1.asp\">share southern skies</a> with another naked-eye comet,\nalso anticipated to brighten in May, designated C/2001 Q4 (NEAT).",
