  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThese two mighty galaxies are pulling each other apart.  \n\nKnown as \"<a href=\"http://sites.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/11/prc/prc0211d.txt\">The Mice</a>\" because they have such long tails, each \n<a href=\"spiral_galaxies.html\">spiral galaxy</a> \nhas likely already passed through the other.\n\nThey will probably collide again and again until they coalesce.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/NAS/NAS.html\">long\ntails</a> are created by the relative \n\n<a href=\"http://www.clupeid.demon.co.uk/tides/\nsimple.html\">difference between gravitational pulls</a> \non the near and far parts of each galaxy. \n\nBecause the distances are so large, \nthe cosmic interaction takes place in slow motion -- \nover hundreds of millions of years.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1974ApJ...187..219S\">NGC 4676</a>\nlies about 300 million \n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\ncosmic_distance.html\">light-years</a> away toward the constellation of \n<a href=\"http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/\ncom.html\">Coma Berenices</a> and are \n<a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/\nnph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1961ApJ...133..726B\">likely members</a>\nof the <a href=\"ap020203.html\">Coma Cluster of Galaxies</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://sites.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/11/\npr-photos.html#d\">above picture</a> was taken with the \n\n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s\n<a href=\"http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/\">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a> \nwhich is more sensitive and images a larger field than \nprevious Hubble cameras.  \n\nThe camera's increased sensitivity has imaged, serendipitously, \n<a href=\"ap000709.html\">galaxies far</a> \nin the distance scattered about the frame.",
