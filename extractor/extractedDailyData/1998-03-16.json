  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nRocks from space hit Earth every day.  \nThe larger the rock, though, the less often Earth is struck.  \nMany kilograms of space dust pitter to Earth daily. \nLarger bits appear initially as a bright <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html\">meteor</a>.  Baseball-sized rocks and ice-balls \nstreak through our atmosphere daily, \nmost evaporating quickly to nothing.  \n<a href=\"http://ccf.arc.nasa.gov/sst/index.html\">Significant threats</a> do exist for rocks near \n100 meters in diameter, \nwhich strike Earth roughly every 1000 years.  \nAn object this size could cause significant \ntidal waves were it to strike an ocean, \npotentially devastating even distant shores. \n\nA collision with a \n<a href=\"ap970629.html\">massive asteroid</a>, \nover 1 km across, \n<a href=\"ap980313.html\">is more rare</a>, \noccurring typically millions of years apart, but \n<a href=\"http://ccf.arc.nasa.gov/sst/spaceguard.html\">could have truly global consequences</a>. \n\nMany asteroids remain undiscovered.  \nIn fact, the discovery of several was announced \nlast week; one is shown as the long blue streak in the \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/10/\">above photograph</a>.\n\nSuch an \n<a href=\"http://ccf.arc.nasa.gov/sst/index.html\">interplanetary collision</a> \nwould not affect Earth's orbit so much as raise dust \nthat would \n<a href=\"http://www.permanent.com/a_impact.htm\">affect Earth's climate</a>.  \nOne likely result is a global extinction of \nmany species of life, \npossibly dwarfing the ongoing \n<a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/~r9endspp/endspp.html\">extinction occurring now</a>.",
