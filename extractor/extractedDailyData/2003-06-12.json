  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe formation of a\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/\nblack_holes.html\">black hole</a> from the collapsing\ncore of a massive star is thought to be heralded by a spectacular\nsupernova explosion.\n\nSuch an  extremely energetic collapse is also a\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304173\">leading explanation</a>\nfor the mysterious cosmic <a href=\"ap020228.html\">gamma-ray bursts</a>.\n\nBut researchers now suggest that the Milky Way's most\nfamous black hole,\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/eduoff/catchastar/cas-projects/\naustria_cygnus_1/\">Cygnus X-1</a>, was born when a massive\nstar collapsed --\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305205\">without\nany supernova explosion</a> at all.\n\nTheir dynamical evidence is summarized in this\ncolor image of a gorgeous\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/YBA/cyg-X1-mass/\ncygX1-more3.html\">region in Cygnus</a>,\nshowing Cyg X-1 and a cluster of massive stars\n(yellow circles) known as Cygnus OB3.\n\nArrows compare the measured direction and speed of Cyg X-1\nand the average direction and speed of the massive stars\nof Cyg OB3.\n\nThe similar motions indicate that\nCyg X-1's progenitor star was itself a cluster member\nand that its path was not altered at all when it\nbecame a black hole.\n\nIn contrast, if Cyg X-1 were born in a violent supernova\nit would have likely received a\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2002/30/\">fierce\nkick</a>, changing its course.\n\nIf not a supernova, could\n<a href=\"http://saturn.sron.nl/~erikk/v4641sgr/\">the formation</a>\nof the Cyg X-1 black\nhole have produced a <a href=\"http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/public/news/\narchive/2002/02-257.html\">dark</a>\ngamma-ray burst in\n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/gamma/milkyway.html\">the\nMilky Way</a>?",
