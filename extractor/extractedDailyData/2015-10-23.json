  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nBeautiful island universe\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m094.html\">Messier 94 lies</a>\na mere 15 million light-years\ndistant in the northern constellation of the hunting dogs,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici\">Canes\nVenatici</a>.\n\nA popular target for earth-based astronomers,\nthe face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across,\nwith spiral arms sweeping through the\n<a href=\"ap100114.html\">outskirts of its </a> broad disk.\n\nBut this <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1542a\">Hubble\nSpace Telescope field of view</a> spans about\n7,000 light-years or so across M94's central region.\n\nThe sharp close-up examines the galaxy's compact,\nbright nucleus and prominent inner dust lanes,\nsurrounded by a remarkable bluish ring of young,\nmassive stars.\n\nThe massive stars in the ring are all likely less than 10 million \nyears old, indicating the galaxy experienced  a well-defined\nera of rapid star formation.\n\nAs a result, while the small, bright nucleus is typical of the\n<a href=\"http://spider.seds.org/spider/ScholarX/seyferts.html\">Seyfert</a>\nclass of active galaxies, M94 is also known as a\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/\nstarburst.html\">starburst galaxy</a>.\n\nBecause M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can explore\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011101\">in detail</a>\nreasons for the galaxy's burst of star formation.",
