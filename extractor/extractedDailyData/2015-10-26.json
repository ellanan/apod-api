  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat do the moons of \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-pluto-k4.html\">Pluto</a> look like?\n\nBefore a decade ago, only the largest moon \n<a href=\"ap000409.html\">Charon</a> was known, but never imaged.\n\nAs the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/spacecraft/index.html\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> was prepared and launched, \n<a href=\"ap060624.html\">other moons</a> were identified on \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/\">Hubble</a> images but remained only \n<a href=\"ap130708.html\">specks of light</a>.\n\nFinally, this past summer, New Horizons swept right \n<a href=\"ap151006.html\">past Pluto</a>, photographed \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Images/index.php\">Pluto</a> and \n<a href=\"ap151002.html\">Charon</a> in detail, and took the best images of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_(moon)\">Styx</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(moon)\">Nix</a>, \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=330\">Kerberos</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://www.theoi.com/Ther/DrakonHydra.html\">Hydra</a> that it could.\n\nThe \n<a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20033\">featured image</a> \ncomposite shows the results -- \neach moon is seen to have a distinct shape, while underlying complexity is only hinted.\n\nEven though not satisfyingly resolved, \n<a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=331\">these images</a> are likely to be the best available to humanity for some time.\n\nThis is because the moons are too small and distant for contemporary Earth-based telescopes to resolve, and no new\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Pluto\">missions to the Pluto system</a> are planned.",
