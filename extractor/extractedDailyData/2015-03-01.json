  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nAlmost every object in the above photograph is a galaxy. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Cluster\">Coma Cluster of Galaxies</a> \n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2008/24/caption.html\">pictured above</a> \nis one of the densest \n<a href=\"clusters_of_galaxies.html\">clusters</a> known - it contains thousands of <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-are-galaxies/\">galaxies</a>. \n\nEach of these galaxies houses billions of stars - \njust as our own <a href=\"\nhttp://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_milky.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> does. \n\nAlthough nearby when compared to most other \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster\">clusters</a>, light from the <a href=\"ap100502.html\">Coma Cluster</a> \nstill takes hundreds of millions of years to reach us. \n\nIn fact, the \n<a href=\"http://www.chandra.si.edu/photo/2013/coma/\">Coma Cluster</a> is so big it takes light \nmillions of years just to go from one side to the other! \n\nThe <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/24/image/a/\">above mosaic</a> of images of a small portion of \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh7aS5__b4k\">Coma</a> was taken in unprecedented detail in 2006 by the \n<a href=\"ap010806.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> \nto investigate how galaxies in rich clusters form and evolve.  \n\nMost galaxies in <a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/objects/coma.html\">Coma</a> and other clusters are \n<a href=\"elliptical_galaxies.html\">ellipticals</a>, although some \nimaged here are clearly spirals.   \n\nThe spiral galaxy on the upper left of the \n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/24/image/\">above image</a> can also be found as one of the bluer galaxies on the upper left of \n<a href=\"ap060321.html\">this wider field image</a>.\n\nIn the background thousands of unrelated galaxies are \n<a href=\"ap040309.html\">visible far across the universe</a>.",
