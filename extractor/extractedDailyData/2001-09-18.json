  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nJust after landing on Mars in 1997, \nthe robotic \n<a href=\"http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/index1.html\">Mars Pathfinder</a> \n<a href=\"ap000912.html\">main station</a> \ntook a quick first look around. \n\n<a href=\"http://faculty.physics.tamu.edu/lemmon/about_udp.html\">This insurance panorama</a> was taken even before the \n<a href=\"ap970710.html\">Sagan Memorial Station</a> \ncamera was raised to its two-meter-high perch.  \n\nThe full view is best seen by slowly scrolling to the right.  \n\nThe unique perspective captures many \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/sci_desc.html\">Mars Pathfinder instruments</a> in the close foreground including a \nscreen for judging sky illumination, communications antennae, \n<a href=\"http://www.qrg.nwu.edu/projects/vss/docs/Power/1-what-are-solar-panels.html\">solar panels</a>, \nand two ramps leading down to the surface for the \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/mission.html\">robot probe Sojourner</a>.  \n\nAfter taking the ramp on the right, \n<a href=\"ap991030.html\">Sojourner</a> can be seen on the \n<a href=\"ap000514.html\">Martian surface</a>.  \n\nVisible on the surface are numerous \n<a href=\"ap980309.html\">rocks</a> and \n<a href=\"ap990704.html\">hills</a> that came to be better studied.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/mpf.pdf\">Mars Pathfinder mission</a> went on to return \n16,000 images and data that resulted in \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf-pressrel.html\">many discoveries</a>, including evidence for \nwarmer and wetter conditions on \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html\">Mars</a> in the past.  \n\nAfter nearly three spectacular months exploring the surface, \n<a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf-929-pressrel.html\">Mars Pathfinder dropped out of communication</a>, \nlikely the result of depleted battery power.",
