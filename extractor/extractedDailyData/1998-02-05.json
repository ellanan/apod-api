  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis canyon on\n<a href=\"ap971211.html\">the surface of Mars</a> appears to have been\ncarved by flowing water.\n\nKnown as Nanedi Vallis, the terraces and channels visible within the\ncanyon strongly suggest that\n<a href=\"http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/wetmars.html\">a river of water once ran here</a>.\n\nBut the lack of smaller surface channels and other features\n<a href=\"http://barsoom.msss.com/mars/global_surveyor/camera/\nimages/2_2_98_release/8704/index.html\">argue that the valley was formed</a> by a surface collapse.\n\n<a href=\"http://barsoom.msss.com/\">Further images</a> of\n<a href=\"http://barsoom.msss.com/http/ps/channels/channels.html\">Martian valley systems</a> will help distinguish\nthe degree to which these processes affected the Martian surface.\n\n<a href=\"http://barsoom.msss.com/mars/global_surveyor/camera/\nimages/2_2_98_release/8704/index.html\">This image was recorded</a>\non January 8th by the\n<a href=\"ap970911.html\">Mars Global Surveyor</a>'s camera\nduring its 87th orbit\n<a href=\"http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/fun/mars_chro.html\">of the red planet</a>.\n\nThe area pictured is about 6 miles wide.\n\n<a href=\"image/9802/marsriver1_mgs_big.jpg\">High resolution versions</a> of the image\nshow features that are as small as 40 feet across.",
