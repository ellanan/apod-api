  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes an alignment like this occur only once in a blue moon?\n\nNo, although it was during a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_moon\">blue moon</a> that this single-shot image was taken. \n\nDuring a full \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">moon</a> that happened to be the second of the month -- \nthe situation that defines a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0fy1HeJv80\">blue moon</a> -- \nthe photographer created the juxtaposition in late January by quickly moving around to find just the right spot to get the \n<a href=\"ap120102.html\">background Moon</a> \nsuperposed behind the arc of a \n<a href=\"ap170320.html\">foreground tree</a>. \n\nUnfortunately, in this case, there seemed no other way than getting bogged down in mud and resting the camera on a barbed-wire fence. \n\nThe arc in the oak tree was previously created by hungry cows in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Ferry,_California\">Knight's Ferry</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>.  \n\nQuirky \n<a href=\"ap150723.html\">Moon-tree juxtaposition</a>s \nlike this can be created during any \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-earth/Moon_phases_drawing.gif\">full moon</a> though, given enough \n<a href=\"http://www.mqltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/o-CAT-COMPUTER-facebook-750x390.jpg\">planning</a> and time. \n\nAnother opportunity will arise this weekend, coincidently during another \n<a href=\"ap040731.html\">blue moon</a>.\n\nThen, the <i>second</i> blue moon in 2018 will occur, meaning that for the second month this year, two full moons will appear during a single month (moon-th). \n\n<a href=\"https://www.obliquity.com/astro/blue-twolist.html\">Double blue-moon</a> years are \n<a href=\"https://www.obliquity.com/astro/blue-two.html\">relatively rare</a>, with the last occurring in 1999, and the next in 2037.",
