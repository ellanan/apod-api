  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLocated just 500 light-years away toward the constellation\n<a href=\"ap080508.html\">Scorpius</a>,\nthis star is only slightly less massive and a little cooler than\n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html\">the Sun</a>.\n\nBut it is much younger, a few\n<a href=\"http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/six.asp\">million</a> years old\ncompared to the middle-aged Sun's 5\n<a href=\"http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp\">billion</a> years.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/sunstarplanet\">This sharp infrared\nimage</a> shows the young star has a likely companion\npositioned above and left - a hot planet with about 8 times\nthe mass of Jupiter, orbiting a whopping 330 times the Earth-Sun\n<a href=\"ap981212.html\">distance</a> from its parent star.\n\nThe young planetary companion is still hot and relatively\nbright in\n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/\ncosmic_reference/whatisir.html\">infrared</a> light due to\nthe heat generated during its formation by\ngravitational contraction.\n\nIn fact, such newborn planets are easier to detect\nbefore they age and cool, becoming much fainter.\n\nThough over 300\n<a href=\"http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/atlas/atlas_index.cfm\">extrasolar\nplanets</a> have been found using other\ntechniques, this picture likely represents the\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1424\">first direct</a> image\nof a planet belonging to a star\n<a href=\"ap030208.html\">similar</a> to the Sun.",
