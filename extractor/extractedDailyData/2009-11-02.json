  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLast week, NASA test fired a new rocket.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_I\">Ares 1</a>-X was the\nfirst non-<a href=\"ap090513.html\">shuttle rocket</a> launched from\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html\">Kennedy Space Center</a> since the\n<a href=\"ap010525.html\">Saturn</a> launched humans to Earth\norbit and the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> is testing Ares as a\nprelude to replacing the aging space shuttle fleet.\n\nThe tremendous thrust of the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/index.html\">Ares 1-X</a> can bring the massive rocket from a standing start to a\nvertical speed of over 100 kilometers per hour in under eight seconds.  \n\nThe test <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtTMInMGi7k\">rocket launched</a> last week was longer than a\nfootball field and covered with over 700 sensors to record data that will enable engineers to refine details of future Ares rockets.  \n\nPictured above, the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMvFGupDPUU\">Ares 1-X blasts into space</a> while the top part of the rocket becomes engulfed in a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl-Glauert_Singularity\">shock collar</a> of water droplets likely created by the sudden drop of air pressure.",
