  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSouth of the large star-forming region known as the\nOrion Nebula, lies bright blue reflection nebula\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2000/10/952-Image.html\">NGC 1999</a>.\n\nAt the edge of the\n<a href=\"http://www.messier.seds.org/more/oricloud.html\">Orion molecular\ncloud</a> complex some 1,500 light-years distant, NGC 1999's\nillumination is provided by the embedded variable star V380 Orionis.\n\nThe nebula is marked with a dark sideways T-shape at center right in\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/68p5nt/\">this telescopic vista</a>\nthat spans about two full moons on the sky.\n\nIts dark shape was once assumed to\nbe an obscuring dust cloud seen in silhouette.\n\nBut <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2202\">infrared data</a>\nsuggest the shape is likely a hole blown through the nebula\nitself by energetic young stars.\n\nIn fact,\n<a href=\"ap180307.html\">this region abounds</a>\nwith energetic young stars\nproducing jets and outflows with luminous shock waves.\n\nCataloged as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, named for astronomers\nGeorge Herbig and Guillermo Haro,\nthe shocks have intense reddish hues.\n\nHH1 and HH2 are just below and right of NGC 1999.\n\nHH222, also known as the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2000/10/952-Image.html\">Waterfall nebula</a>,\nlooks like a red gash near top right in the frame.\n\nTo create the shocks <a href=\"ap220121.html\">stellar jets</a> push through\nthe surrounding material at speeds of\nhundreds of kilometers per <i>second</i>.",
