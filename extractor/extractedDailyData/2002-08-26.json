  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe ancient text has no known title, no known author, \nand is written in no known language: \nwhat does it say and why does it have many astronomy illustrations?  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/voynich.html\">mysterious book</a> was once bought by an \n<a href=\"http://87.1911encyclopedia.org/R/RU/RUDOLPH_II_.htm\">emperor</a>, forgotten on a library shelf, \nsold for thousands of dollars, and later donated to \n<a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/\">Yale</a>.  \n\nPossibly written in the 15th century, \nthe over 200-page \n<a href=\"http://voynich.no-ip.com/folios/\">volume</a> is known most recently as the \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/voynich.html\">Voynich Manuscript</a>, after its (re-)discoverer in 1912.  \n\nPictured above is an illustration from \n<a href=\"http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/mirror/reeds/bib.html\">the book</a> that appears to be somehow related to the Sun. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.voynich.com/\">The book</a> \nlabels some patches of the sky with unfamiliar constellations.  \n\nThe inability of modern <a href=\"http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/iaucomm41/\">historians \nof astronomy</a> to understand the origins of these <a href=\"http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/history/exhibits/constellations/timeline.html\">constellations</a> is perhaps dwarfed by the inability of \nmodern code-breakers to understand the book's text.  \n\nThe book remains in \n<a href=\"http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/\">Yale's rare book collection</a> under catalog number \"MS 408.\"",
