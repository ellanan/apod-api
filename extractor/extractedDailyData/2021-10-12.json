  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat makes a meteor a fireball? \n\nFirst of all, everyone agrees that a \n<a href=\"ap171225.html\">fireball</a> is an exceptionally bright meteor.\n\nPast that, the \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/administration/about/\">International Astronomical Union</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/themes/meteors_and_meteorites/\">defines a fireball</a> as a meteor brighter than \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude\">apparent magnitude</a> -4, \nwhich corresponds (roughly) to being brighter than any planet -- \nas well as bright enough to cast a human-noticeable shadow. \n\nPictured, an astrophotographer taking a long-duration sky image \ncaptured by accident the brightest \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/overview/\">meteor</a> he had ever seen. \n\nClearly a <a href=\"ap210315.html\">fireball</a>, \nthe disintegrating space-rock created a trail so bright it \n<a href=\"ap130218.html\">turned night into day</a> for about two seconds earlier this month. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/\">fireball</a> \nhas been artificially dimmed in the featured image to bring up foreground \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4K5sCmRV54Y\">Lake Louise</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta\">Alberta</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>. \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"ap130209.html\">fireballs</a> are rare, \nmany people have been lucky enough to see them. \n\nIf <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/550x/81/21/c0/8121c0291fa14d1fe52b9eb007741cac.jpg\">you see</a> a fireball, you can \n<a href=\"https://www.imo.net/fireball-over-adriatic-sea-on-august-18/\">report it</a>. \n\nIf more than one person recorded an image, the \n<a href=\"https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/\">fireball</a> might be \n<a href=\"ap090511.html\">traceable back</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">Solar System</a> body from which it was \n<a href=\"ap200916.html\">ejected</a>.",
