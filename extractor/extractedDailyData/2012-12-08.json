  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\n<a href=\"ap081122.html\">A Full Moon rises</a> in this waterfront scene.\n\nIts colorful, watery reflection is joined by harbor lights and\na windowed skyscraper's echo of the western horizon just after sunset.\n\nThe tantalizing image is a composite of frames recorded at 2 minute\nintervals on November 28 from the Caspian Sea\n<a href=\"ap120920.html\">port city of Baku</a>, Azerbaijan. \n\nStill, this Full Moon was not really as big or as bright as others,\nthough it might be hard to tell.\n\nIn fact, November 28's Full Moon was near apogee, making it the\n<a href=\"ap121129.html\">smallest Full Moon</a> of 2012.\n\nAs it rose over the Baku boardwalk (along with much of the\neastern hemisphere), it was also in the Earth's lighter or\n<a href=\"ap060909.html\">penumbral shadow</a>.\n\nThe subtle effect of the\n<a href=\"http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2012.html#LE2012Nov28N\">penumbral\nlunar eclipse</a> is just discernible\nas the slightly darker left side of the lunar disk.\n\nOpposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky, the Full Moon was also\njoined by <a href=\"ap121127.html\">bright planet Jupiter</a>, only a\nfew days from its own opposition.",
