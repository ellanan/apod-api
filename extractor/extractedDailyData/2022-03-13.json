  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy would the sky glow like a giant repeating rainbow?  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/airglow2.htm\">Airglow</a>. \n\nNow air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see.\n\nA disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- \nmay cause noticeable rippling in the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a>.\n\nThese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave\">gravity waves</a> are \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/hgrav.htm\">oscillations in air</a> analogous to those created when a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9QwiBFN9gI\">rock is thrown in calm water</a>. \n\nRed airglow likely originates from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl\">OH molecules</a> \nabout 87-kilometers high, excited by \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> from the Sun, while orange and green \n<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1508084112\">airglow</a> \nis likely caused by \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/11.shtml\">sodium</a> and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml\">oxygen</a> atoms slightly higher up. \n\nWhile driving near \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jZ0dant6XjM\">Keluke Lake</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinghai\">Qinghai Provence</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a> a few years ago, \nthe photographer originally noticed mainly the impressive central band of the \n<a href=\"ap080713.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. \n\nStopping to photograph it, \n<a href=\"https://ccanimalclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/surprised-cat-1-resized.jpg\">surprisingly</a>, the resulting sensitive camera image showed \n<a href=\"ap170221.html\">airglow bands</a> to be quite prominent and span the entire sky.\n\nThe featured image has been digitally enhanced to make the colors more vibrant.",
