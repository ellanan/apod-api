  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nMany stars form in clusters.\n\nGalactic or\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html\">open star\nclusters</a> are relatively young\nswarms of bright stars\n<a href=\"http://universe-review.ca/F06-star-cluster.htm\">born\ntogether</a> near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nSeparated by about a degree on the sky, two\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/B_WINTER/M46_M47.HTM\">nice\nexamples</a> are M46\n(upper left) 5,400 light-years in the distance\nand M47\n(lower right) only 1,600 light-years away toward\nthe nautical constellation\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/pup/index.html\">Puppis</a>.\n\nAround 300 million years\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m046.html\">young M46</a>\ncontains a few hundred stars in a region about 30 light-years\nacross.\n\nAged 80 million years,\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m047.html\">M47 is a</a>\n\nsmaller but looser cluster\nof about 50 stars spanning 10 light-years.\n\nBut\n<a href=\"http://hetlage.com/images/m46m47_021005_large.jpg\">this\nportrait</a> of stellar youth also contains\nan ancient interloper.\n\nThe small, colorful patch of glowing gas in M46 is actually\nthe <a href=\"ap030614.html\">planetary nebula</a> NGC 2438 - the\nfinal phase in the life of a sun-like star <i>billions</i>\nof years old.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n2438.html\">NGC\n2438</a> is estimated to be only 3,000 light-years distant\nand likely represents a foreground object, only by chance appearing\nalong our line of sight to youthful M46.",
