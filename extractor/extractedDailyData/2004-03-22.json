  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nLast week, a small asteroid approached unusually close to the Earth. \n\nAsteroid <a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news142.html\">2004 FH</a> posed no danger, but became bright enough to \nsee with binoculars. \n\nPassing only 7 Earth radii away, this \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a> pass was the \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/neo_ca?past=1\">closest yet</a> that was previously predicted, \nalthough it was \n<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/\">discovered</a> \nonly two days before.\n\nPictured above, the 30-meter sized \n<a href=\"http://space.com/scienceastronomy/asteroid_flewby_040319.html\">2004 FH</a> was imaged from \n<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sz.html\">Switzerland</a> crossing the sky on March 18, near its closest approach.  \n\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1218_1.asp\">The asteroid</a>, centered in the above time-lapse movie covering \nabout 30 minutes, \nchanges in brightness as it tumbles by.  \n\nAn asteroid this size \n<a href=\"ap020623.html\">passes this close</a> \nto Earth about every two years.  \n\nWere <a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mpec/K04/K04F24.html\">2004 FH</a> to have struck the Earth, it would have \nlikely burned up in the atmosphere.\n\n<a href=\"ap990711.html\">Large impact features</a> on the \nEarth are testaments, however, to \n<a href=\"ap021027.html\">larger asteroids</a> and \n<a href=\"ap040319.html\">comets</a> that actually impacted the \n<a href=\"ap010204.html\">Earth</a> in the distant past. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.aas.org/education/career.html\">Astronomers</a> continue to discover, track, and study \n<a href=\"http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/#intro\">potentially hazardous asteroids</a> with a goal of making \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg\">planet Earth</a> a safer place.",
