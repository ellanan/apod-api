In this <a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/p47935.html\">just-released nighttime picture</a>\nof <a href=\"ap960827.html\">Jupiter</a>'s moon <a href=\"ap960805.html\">Io</a>,\nthe red spots clearly show <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/io.html\">Io</a>'s\ncurrent <a href=\"ap960908.html\">volcanically active regions</a>.\n But what is causing the global green sheen?  This telling picture\nwas taken by the automated <a href=\"ap960830.html\">Galileo</a>\n<a href=\"ap951206.html\">spacecraft</a> currently orbiting <a href=\"ap950625.html\">Jupiter</a>\nwhile Io was in Jupiter's shadow. One hypothesis is that the green\nglow is caused by a different type of <a href=\"ap961018.html\">aurora</a>\nresulting from high-energy particles interacting with <a href=\"ap960815.html\">Io's volcanic plumes</a>.",
