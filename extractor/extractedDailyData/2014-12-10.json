  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNow known to be a globular star cluster at the tender\nage of 10 billion years,\n<a href=\"http://messier.seds.org/m/m071.html\">M71 is</a>\na mere 13,000 light-years\naway within the narrow boundaries of the faint constellation Sagitta.\n\nClose to the plane of the Milky Way galaxy in\nplanet Earth's sky, its 10,000 or so member stars are\ngathered into a region about 27 light-years across near the center of\n<a href=\"http://bf-astro.com/m71/m71.htm\">this color composite view</a>.\n\nIn fact, the line-of-sight to M71 passes along\nthe galactic plane through much intervening\n<a href=\"http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/StarProp/\ndust.html\">diffuse interstellar dust</a>.\n\nThe dust dims starlight and scatters blue light more efficiently,\nmasking the brightness\n<a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1018a/\">of M71's stars</a>\nand shifting true star colors toward the red.\n\nHow much are the star colors shifted?\n\nSlide your cursor over the image (or follow\n<a href=\"image/1412/m71FrankeNoExt.jpg\" \"=\"\">this link</a>)\nto use an estimate of the dust reddening or\n<a href=\"http://bf-astro.com/ic342extinction.htm\">galactic extinction</a>\nto correct the star colors in M71.\n\nCorrections to the brightness and colors of M71 member stars are needed\nto measure the cluster's distance and age using a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nGlobular_cluster#Color-magnitude_diagram\">Color-Magnitude diagram</a>.",
