  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space \nat over 500,000 kilometers per hour.\n\nCentered and moving upward in the\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/dl30yu/\">sharply detailed color composite</a>\nits thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples \nin a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on.\n\nDiscovered in the 1840s by\n<a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/curatorial/remembering-sir-john-fw-herschel-1792-1871\">Sir John Herschel</a>,\nthe narrow-looking nebula\nis sometimes known as Herschel's Ray.\n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2003/16/1350-Image.html\">Cataloged as NGC 2736</a>, \nits pointed appearance suggests its modern popular name, the Pencil Nebula.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4rXhOArFw8\">Pencil Nebula</a>\nis about 800 light-years away.\n\nNearly 5 light-years long it represents only a small part of the\n<a href=\"ap100910.html\">Vela supernova remnant</a> though.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Supernova_Remnant\">enormous Vela remnant itself</a>\nis around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding\n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html\">debris cloud of a star</a>\nthat was seen to <a href=\"ap131001.html\">explode</a> about 11,000 years ago.\n\nInitially, the section of the\n<a href=\"ap200202.html\">shock wave</a> seen as the Pencil nebula was moving\nat millions of kilometers\nper hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up\nsurrounding interstellar material.",
