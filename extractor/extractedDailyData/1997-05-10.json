The \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/APOLLO/LMordered.html\">lunar module</a> \nshown above, named \"Falcon,\" served as home for \n<a href=\"http://www.space.edu/campus/book/chapter16.html\">Apollo 15</a>\nastronauts \n<a href=\"http://nauts.com/histpace/images/scott_d01.jpg\">David \nScott</a> and \n<a href=\"ap960223.html\">James \nIrwin</a> during their stay on the Moon in\nJuly and August 1971. Meanwhile, astronaut \n<a href=\"http://nauts.com/astro/worden/worden.html\">Alfred \nWorden</a> circled in the command module overhead.\nHarsh sunlight on the grey lunar surface lends the image an eerie quality,\nwhile the\n<a href=\"http://www.u-net.com/ph/mas/members/lunar/alpine.htm\">Lunar Apennine Mountains</a> frame the background with Mount\nHadley Delta visible on the right.  Visible in the foreground are tracks\nfrom the first \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/APOLLO/AS15/LRV.html\">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a>, \nan electric car which enabled the\nastronauts to explore extended areas on the lunar surface.  \n<a href=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo-15/apollo-15.html\">Apollo 15</a> \nconfirmed that most lunar surface features were created by\n<a href=\"ap960112.html\">impacts</a>.\nRocks returned by the \n<a href=\"http://www.nasm.edu/APOLLO/AS15/Apollo15_fact.html\">Apollo 15</a> \ncrew included green glasses whose formation\nmechanism is still unclear.",
