  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThe 1970s \n<a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/elvis/elnix.html\">are</a>\noften overlooked.\n\nIn particular, the beautiful grouping of reflection nebulae\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosurf.com/jwisn/ngc1977.htm\">NGC 1977,\nNGC 1975, and NGC 1973</a> in Orion are\noften overlooked in favor of\nthe substantial stellar nursery better known as the Orion Nebula.\n\nFound along the sword of Orion just north\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n1976x.html\">of the\nbright Orion Nebula</a> complex, these nebulae are also associated\n<a href=\"ap021220.html\">with Orion's</a> giant\nmolecular cloud which lies about\n<a href=\"ap020530.html\">1,500 light-years away</a>, but\nare dominated by the characteristic blue color of interstellar\ndust reflecting light from hot young stars.\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.astrophoto.net/ngc1977.html\">this sharp\ncolor image</a> a portion of the Orion Nebula appears\nalong the bottom border with the cluster\n<a href=\"ap011228.html\">of reflection nebulae</a>\nat picture center.\n\nNGC 1977 stretches across the field just below center,\nseparated from NGC 1973 (above right) and NGC 1975 (above left)\nby dark regions laced with faint red emission from\nhydrogen atoms.\n\nTaken together, the dark regions suggest to many the\nshape of <a href=\"http://rao.150m.com/NGC1977.html\">a running man</a>.",
