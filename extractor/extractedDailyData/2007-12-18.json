  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nYou're rolling across Mars when you unexpectedly uncover some unusually light soil.   \n\nYou stop.  You turn.  You return to inspect the soil and find out it is almost purely \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica\">silica</a> -- the main ingredient in \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz\">quartz</a> and \n<a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7765557442856739526\">glass</a>.  \n\nSuch soil has never been found on \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html\">Mars</a> before.  What created this soil?  \n\nSince <a href=\"ap070204.html\">you</a> are the robotic \n<a href=\"ap051214.html\">rover</a> Spirit currently rolling across Mars, \nyou send the images and data back to \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a> for analysis.  \n\nYour scientist friends from the blue water planet say that such soil on Earth is usually created by either volcanic steam or a \n<a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/85202634w115727m/\">hot spring</a>.  \n\nThe second hypothesis in particular indicates, once again, a \n<a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00043A86-0C6D-1045-8C6D83414B7F0000\">wet past</a> for part of Mars, \nas possibly hot water saturated with silica deposited the white soil.  \n\nIntriguingly, on Earth, living \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism\">microbes</a> \ntypically flourish under either condition.  \n\n<a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html\">Pictured above</a>, the uncovered light soil is \n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/images/pia09491.html\">visible</a> on the right.",
