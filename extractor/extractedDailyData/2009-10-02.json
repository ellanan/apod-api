  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nThese colorful panels both\nfeature a familiar astronomical sight: the stellar nursery known as\nthe <a href=\"ap090826.html\">Great Orion Nebula</a>.\n\nThey also offer an intriguing and unfamiliar detail of the\n<a href=\"ap980604.html\">nebula rich</a> skyscape -- a passing comet.\n\nRecorded this weekend with a remotely operated telescope in \nNew Mexico, the right hand image was taken on\n<a href=\"image/0910/M42-217P_090926.jpg\">September 26</a> and\nthe left on <a href=\"image/0910/M42-217P_090927.jpg\">September 27</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/217p.html\">Comet 217P Linear</a>\nsports an extended <a href=\"ap090207.html\">greenish tail</a> and lies\nabove the bluish\n<a href=\"http://www.astrosurf.com/antilhue/ngc1977.htm\">Running Man</a>\nreflection nebula near the top of\nboth frames.\n\nNearby and moving rapidly through the night sky, the comet's\nposition clearly shifts against the cosmic nebulae and background\nstars from one night to the next.\n\nIn fact, the comet was a mere 5 light-<i>minutes</i> away on September\n27, compared to 1,500 light-years for the Orion Nebula.\n\nMuch too faint to be seen with the unaided eye,\n<a href=\"http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/0217P/2009.html\">Comet\n217P Linear</a>\nis a small periodic comet with an orbital period of\nabout 8 years.\n\nAt its most distant point from the Sun,\n<a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?orb=1;sstr=217P\">the comet's\norbit</a> is calculated to reach beyond the orbit of Jupiter\n\nAt its closest point to the Sun, the comet still lies just\nbeyond the orbit of planet Earth.",
