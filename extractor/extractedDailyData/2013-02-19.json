  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHave you ever seen the planet Mercury?  \n\nBecause \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29\">Mercury</a> \norbits so close to the Sun, it never wanders far from the Sun in\n<a href=\"ap050913.html\">Earth's sky</a>.\n\nIf trailing the Sun, \n<a href=\"mercury.html\">Mercury</a> will be visible \nlow on the horizon for only a short while\n<a href=\"ap020510.html\">after sunset</a>.\n\nIf leading the Sun, \n<a href=\"ap081008.html\">Mercury</a> will be visible only shortly before sunrise.\n\nSo at certain times of the year an\n<a href=\"http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance/article_110_1.asp\">informed skygazer</a> with a little determination can usually pick \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=117lEleTeiY\">Mercury</a> \nout from a site with an unobscured horizon.\n\nAbove, a lot of determination has been combined \nwith a little \n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/J_DIGIT/\nETHICS.HTM\">digital manipulation</a> to\nshow Mercury's successive positions during March of 2000.  \n\nEach picture was taken from the same location in Spain \nwhen the Sun itself was 10 degrees below the \n<a href=\"ap970909.html\">horizon</a> and superposed on the single most \n<a href=\"ap120520.html\">photogenic sunset</a>.  \n\nCurrently, Mercury is \n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08feb_pinkplanet/\">visible in the western sky</a> after sunset, but will disappear in the Sun's glare after a few days.",
