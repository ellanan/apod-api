  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nFor about 300 years Jupiter's banded atmosphere has shown\na remarkable feature to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nGreat_Red_Spot#Observation_history\">telescopic viewers</a>,\na large swirling storm system known as\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/29/index.html\">The Great Red\nSpot</a>.\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.redspotjr.com/\">2006, another red</a>\nstorm system appeared,\nactually seen to form as smaller whitish oval-shaped storms\nmerged and then developed the curious reddish hue. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/05/\n22_redspots.shtml\">Now, Jupiter has</a> a third red spot, again\nproduced from a smaller whitish storm.\n\nAll three are seen\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/23/\">in\nthis image</a> made from\ndata recorded on May 9 and 10 with the Hubble Space Telescope's\nWide Field and\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/\ninstruments/wfpc2/\">Planetary Camera 2</a>.\n\nThe spots extend above the surrounding clouds\nand their <a href=\"ap960803.html\">red color</a>\nmay be due to deeper material dredged up by the\nstorms and exposed to ultraviolet light, but the exact chemical\nprocess is still unknown.\n\n<a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/2008/23/images/a/formats/\ncompass_large_web.jpg\">For scale</a>,\nthe Great Red Spot has almost twice the diameter\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/\njupiterfact.html\">of planet</a> Earth,\nmaking both new spots less than one Earth-diameter across.\n\nThe newest red spot is on the far left (west), along the same band\nof clouds as the Great Red Spot and is drifting toward it.\n\nIf the motion continues, the new spot will encounter the much\nlarger storm system in August.\n\nJupiter's recent outbreak of red spots is likely related to\nlarge scale <a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/\njupiter_spots_040421.html\">climate change</a>\nas the gas giant planet is getting warmer near the equator.",
