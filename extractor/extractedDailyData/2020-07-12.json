  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere do comet tails come from? \n\nThere are no obvious places on the \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/small-bodies/comets-visited-by-spacecraft-2014.html\">nuclei of comets</a> from which the \n<a href=\"ap150203.html\">jets</a> that create \n<a href=\"ap200707.html\">comet tails</a> emanate. \n\nOne of the best images of emerging jets is shown in the <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2015/02/Comet_on_3_February_2015_NavCam\">featured picture</a>, taken in 2015 by ESA's robotic <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Europe_s_comet_chaser\">Rosetta spacecraft</a> that orbited \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a> \n(Comet CG) from 2014 to 2016. \n\nThe picture shows plumes of gas and dust escaping numerous places from \n<a href=\"ap171106.html\">Comet CG</a>'s nucleus as it neared \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> \nand heated up. \n\nThe comet has two prominent lobes, the larger one spanning about 4 kilometers, \nand a smaller 2.5-kilometer lobe connected by a narrow neck.\n\nAnalyses indicate that \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHmUx0ylg-A\">evaporation</a> must be taking place well inside the comet's surface to create the \n<a href=\"ap200315.html\">jets of dust and ice</a> that we see emitted through the surface. \n\n<a href=\"ap160202.html\">Comet CG</a> (also known as Comet 67P) loses in jets about a meter of radius during each of its 6.44-year orbits around the Sun, a rate at which will completely destroy the comet in only thousands of years.\n\nIn 2016, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/rosetta\">Rosetta</a>'s \n<a href=\"ap161001.html\">mission ended</a> \nwith a controlled impact onto Comet CG's surface.",
