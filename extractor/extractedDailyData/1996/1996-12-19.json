  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>:\n\nHeaded toward the inner Solar System,\n<a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/\">the much anticipated Comet Hale-Bopp</a> has\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/hale_bopp_info.html\">promised to</a>\nput on a big show next spring.\n\n<a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/hale_bopp/hb_light.html\">The comet's apparent brightness</a> is\ncurrently approaching 4th magnitude and\n<a href=\"http://www.nao.ac.jp/pio/HB/index.html\">its inbound journey has been closely followed</a> by many observers.\nBut because it is now so near the Sun's position in the sky it is a difficult\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/comet-hale-bopp/\ncomet-hale-bopp-summary-nov28-96-rw.html\">target for large ground based optical telescopes</a>\nas well as the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope (HST).\n\n<a href=\"http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/~weaver/new_figure.html\">This series of HST images</a>\nhints at the comet's evolution during the last year,\n<a href=\"lib/comets.html\">illustrating</a> active and quiescent phases.\n\nHidden from direct view by the dusty cometary coma,\nHale-Bopp's <a href=\"ap961210.html\">nucleus is</a> centered in each frame.\n\nA single telescopic image of the comet has recently caused\nsubstantial activity on the internet based on false claims of\n<a href=\"http://www.halebopp.com/slo1.htm\">the existence of a mysterious companion</a>.\nHowever, the mystery guest turned out\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/comets/slo.html\">to be an 8th magnitude star!</a>\n\nMany <a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comets/ephemjpl3.html\">predict that</a> by next spring telescopes large or small will not\nbe needed to appreciate <a href=\"ap961112.html\">the true spectacle</a>\nof Hale-Bopp as it blossoms into a <a href=\"ap960428.html\">naked-eye astronomical wonder</a>.",
