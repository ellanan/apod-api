  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Here is what a comet nucleus really looks\nlike.  For all active comets except <a href=\"ap950821.html\">Halley</a>,\nit was only possible to see the surrounding opaque gas cloud called\nthe <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#coma\">coma</a>.  During <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html\">Comet Halley</a>'s\nmost recent pass through the inner <a href=\"ap950819.html\">Solar System</a>\nin 1986, however, spacecraft <a href=\"http://hydra.mpae.gwdg.de/mpae_projects/GIOTTO/giotto.html\">Giotto</a>\nwas able to go right up to the comet and photograph its nucleus.\nThe above image is a composite of hundreds of these photographs.\n Although the most famous comet, <a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/halley.html\">Halley</a>\nachieved in 1986 only 1/10th the brightness that <a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/1996_B2.html\">Comet Hyakutake</a>\ndid last year, and a similar comparison is likely with next year's\npass of <a href=\"ap961113.html\">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>.  Every 76\nyears Comet <a href=\"ap960706.html\">Halley</a> comes around again,\nand each time the nucleus sheds about 6 meters of ice and rock\ninto space.  This debris composes Halley's <a href=\"ap960326.html\">tails</a>\nand leaves an orbiting trail that, when falling to <a href=\"ap960819.html\">Earth</a>,\nare called the <a href=\"ap961021.html\">Orionids Meteor Shower</a>.",
