  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: The <a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/spacecraft.html\">Galileo spacecraft</a>\norbiting Jupiter continues to return impressive results.  The\n<a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/pages.html\">Galileo team</a>\nhas just released three more photographs of <a href=\"lib/jupiter.html\">Jupiter</a>'s\nvolcanic moon <a href=\"ap960815.html\">Io</a> taken in June. \n<a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/092496.html\">These three photos</a>\nare reflected at the bottom of the above picture, digitally enhanced\nto better show important features.  Some areas of  <a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/io.html\">Io</a>,\nit now appears, are truly red, not the usual green and yellow\nhues recorded previously.  In fact, the last major mission - <a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html\">Voyager</a>\n- did not have cameras sensitive to red light.  This red material\nappears to be associated with <a href=\"ap960805.html\">recent volcanic eruptions</a>,\nand the red color appears to fade with time.  Comparisons of these\nphotos with <a href=\"ap950803.html\">17-year old Voyager photos</a>\nshow that about a dozen surface regions -- each the size of <a href=\"http://www.connecticut.com/\">Connecticut</a>--\nhave been affected by <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996LPI%2E%2E%2E%2E27%2E%2E833M&amp;db_key=AST\">Io's active volcanoes</a>.",
