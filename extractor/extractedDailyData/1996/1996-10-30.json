  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: NGC 2997 is a <a href=\"http://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/PH308/galaxies/spiral.html\">grand design</a>\nspiral galaxy.  Its small nucleus and sprawling spiral arms give\nit a <a href=\"http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/k12/hubble/hubble.html\">type \"Sc\"</a>\ndesignation.  <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1978ApJ%2E%2E%2E226%2E%2E%2E75P&amp;db_key=AST\">NGC 2997</a>\nis speeding away from us at about 1100 kilometers per second,\nwhich would place it at about 55 million light years distant,\ngiven <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/d_1996/tv_about.html\">current estimates of the expansion rate of our universe</a>.\n NGC 2997 is thought to have a mass of about 100 billion times\nthat of our <a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>, but is probably\nless massive than our own <a href=\"lib/milky_way.html\">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.\n <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1980PASP...92...38M\">NGC 2997</a>\nis not seen face-on - it is thought tilted by about 45 degrees.\n NGC 2997 is particularly notable for <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1989ApJ...341..722W\">a nucleus surrounded by a chain of hot giant clouds of ionized hydrogen</a>.",
