  "explanation": "<b></b>\n\nResearch balloon flights conducted in 1912 by Austrian physicist Victor Hess\nrevealed that the Earth was constantly bombarded by high energy\nradiation from space - which\n<a href=\"http://flaco.nmsu.edu:80/www/cosmicrays.html\">came to be called \"Cosmic Rays\"</a>. \n<i>What are Cosmic Rays and where do they come from?</i>\nThey are now known to be mostly subatomic particles - predominantly\nprotons and electrons -\n<a href=\"http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/haverah/crs.html\">but their origin is a long standing mystery</a>.\nAfter almost a century of study,\nthis cosmic puzzle may have been at least partially solved by new\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/basic/xray/\nxray_information.html\">X-ray images and spectra</a> from the\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/asca2.html\">ASCA satellite observatory</a>.\nPieced together to show the region around a star observed to go\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960612.html\">supernova</a> in 1006 AD, the overlapping X-ray snapshots above\n(seen in false color) reveal the bright rims of\nthe exploded star's still expanding blast wave.\n<a href=\"http://heasarc/docs/asca/science/graphics/09sep1996/docs/\nsnr_cosmic.html\">These ASCA observations show</a> for the\nfirst time that the energy spectrum of the bright regions is like that\nproduced by extremely high energy electrons\nstreaming through a magnetic field at nearly the speed of light.\n<a href=\"http://webhead.com/~sergio/cosmos95/0095.html\">If (as expected)</a> high energy protons are associated with\nthese energetic electrons\n<a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/science/science_snr.html\">then supernova remnants like SN 1006</a> are sources of Hess'\n<a href=\"http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/cr.html\">puzzling Cosmic Rays</a>.",
