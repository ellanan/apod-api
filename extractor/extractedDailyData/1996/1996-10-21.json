  "explanation": "<b></b> Tonight you might be able to see Halley's\nComet again - or at least some pieces of it.  It is widely thought\nthat that the meteors from the <a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/orionids.html\">Orionids meteor shower</a>,\nwhich peaks tonight, are just small pieces of <a href=\"ap950821.html\">Halley's Comet</a>\nfalling to Earth.  During each pass near the Sun, a comet will\nheat up and <a href=\"ap960729.html\">shed pieces of ice and rock</a>\nfrom its nucleus.  This <a href=\"http://www.earthsky.com/1995/es951020.html\">debris</a>\ncontinues to orbit the <a href=\"ap960916.html\">Sun</a> until\neither evaporating or being swept up by some large solar-system\nbody. A piece of comet debris striking the <a href=\"lib/moon.html\">Moon</a>\ncreates a small crater, but a piece striking the Earth usually\n<a href=\"ap960226.html\">burns up in the atmosphere</a> causing\na <a href=\"http://ericir.syr.edu/Projects/Newton/11/meteors.html\">brief, bright streak</a>.\nEvery year at this time the Earth crosses an old stream of bits\nfrom <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960706.html\">Halley</a>'s\nComet causing the Orionids display, named from the constellation\n(Orion) from which the meteors appear to originate. The \nstreak below center in the above picture of the northern sky actually\ndepicts a meteor from \nthe <a href=\"http://www.injersey.com/Media/IonSci/features/perseids/perseids.html\">Perseid</a>\n<a href=\"http://bradley.bradley.edu/~dware/imo96.html\">meteor shower</a>,\na usually even more impressive display that peaks every year in\nmid-August.  <br>",
