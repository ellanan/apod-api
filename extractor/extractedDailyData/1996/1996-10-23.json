  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: <a href=\"ap950825.html\">Magellan</a> and his\ncrew had plenty of time to study the southern sky during their\nfamous voyage around the world. As a result, two fuzzy cloud like\nobjects in the southern sky are now known as the Clouds of Magellan.\nThese star clouds are small <a href=\"ap950728.html\">irregular galaxies</a>,\nsatellites of our larger <a href=\"ap960213.html\">Milky Way spiral galaxy</a>.\nThe <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/lmc.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a>\npictured above is only about 180,000 light-years distant - the\nonly known galaxy closer is the <a href=\"ap960204.html\">Sagittarius Dwarf</a>.\n Both the LMC and the <a href=\"ap950919.html\">Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC)</a>\nare joined to the <a href=\"ap950908.html\">Milky Way</a> by a\n<a href=\"http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/papers/moore/stream/stream.html\">stream of cold hydrogen gas whose origin</a>\nis still controversial. An unusual effect called <a href=\"ap960424.html\">gravitational lensing</a>\nhas <a href=\"ap960202.html\">recently been detected in a few LMC stars</a>,\nand there is hope this could tell us important information about\nthe true composition of our universe.",
