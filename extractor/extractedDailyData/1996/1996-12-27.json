  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Most of our universe is too dim to see.  To\npeer into our cosmos' unknown depths, astronomers must deploy\nnew tools - and the classic new tool is a larger telescope.  Pictured\nabove is the new <a href=\"http://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/press/firstlight/firstlight.html#photographs\">Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) which recently declared \"first light\"</a>\nin western Texas.  HET currently has the <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/bigeyes.html\">largest single mirror of any optical telescope </a>--\n11 meters in diameter.  Telescopes in space, like the <a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>,\nare much smaller but avoid the <a href=\"http://hplyot.obspm.fr/adaptive_optics.html\">Earth's atmosphere blurring </a>out\nfine detail.  <a href=\"http://www.astro.psu.edu/het/\">HET</a>'s\nhuge size, on the other hand, allows it to see very dim objects\nand determine their spectrum. <a href=\"http://www.astro.psu.edu/het/\">HET's unusual design</a>\nallows the primary mirror to stay put during an observation! \n Only smaller focusing instruments suspending above the primary\nmove  to track an astronomical object.",
