  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Five closely grouped galaxies are visible\nin <a href=\"http://crux.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/stephan.html\">this image</a>\nmade using the <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/kpno/kpno.html\">Kitt Peak National Observatory</a>\n2.1 meter telescope. The grouping is commonly known as Stephan's\nQuintet. Four of the galaxies show essentially the same redshift\nsuggesting that they are at the same distance from us. The large\nbluish <a href=\"lib/spirals.html\">spiral</a> below and left of\ncenter actually has a smaller <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#redshift\">redshift</a>\nthan the others, indicating it is much closer. It is probably\na foreground object which happens to lie along the line of sight\nto the more distant galaxies. Of the four <a href=\"ap960124.html\">distant galaxies</a>,\nthree seem to be <a href=\"ap951228.html\">colliding</a>, showing\nserious distortions due to gravitational tidal forces. The fourth\nis a normal appearing <a href=\"lib/ellipticals.html\">elliptical galaxy</a>\n(at the lower right edge of the field). Recent results suggest\nthat collisions play an important role in the <a href=\"ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">life cycles of galaxies</a>.",
