  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: There are more than a few stars in our Galaxy.\n The light from many of them combines to appear as a wisp of faint\nlight across the night sky - the <a href=\"lib/milky_way.html\">Milky Way</a>.\n In the northern hemisphere, away from <a href=\"ap960617.html\">city lights</a>\nand during the summer months, part of the <a href=\"ap960213.html\">Milky Way</a>\ncan be seen behind the <a href=\"http://cassfos01.ucsd.edu/public/Summer_Triangle.html\">Summer Triangle</a>\nof stars - <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/hr/7924.html\">Deneb</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/hr/7001.html\">Vega</a>,\nand <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/hr/7557.html\">Altair</a>.\n These are the brightest three stars in the <a href=\"http://www.system.missouri.edu/ics/staff/andy/astrop/sumtri/sumtri.htm\">above photograph</a>,\nlisted from left to right, respectively.
