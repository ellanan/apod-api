  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Did you ever feel like a black cloud was following\nyou around? Well don't feel bad - this even happened to the bright\nyoung stars of the <a href=\"ap960903.html\">open cluster</a> NGC\n6520.  On the left are the cluster's bright blue stars.  They\nformed only millions of years ago - much more recently than our\nancient <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/interv.html\">Sun</a>\nwhich formed billions of years ago.  On the right is an <a href=\"lib/dark.html\">absorption nebula </a>from\nwhich the stars might have formed.  This nebula contains much\nopaque <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dust</a> which blocks\nvisible light from the many stars that would have been seen in\nthe background.  The study of open clusters is valuable for many\nreasons which include the understanding <a href=\"ap960127.html\">star formation</a>\nand <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1984ApJ...286..563P\">the calibration of the distance scale of our universe</a>.",
