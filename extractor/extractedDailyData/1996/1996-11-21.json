  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Will the Sun one day look like - a blue snowball?\n Maybe!  The Blue Snowball is a <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1983S%26W%2E%2E%2E%2E22%2E%2E%2E68G&amp;db_key=AST\">planetary nebula</a>\n- and in 5 billion years the <a href=\"ap960518.html\">Sun</a>\nwill throw off its outer layers and go through a <a href=\"lib/planetary.html\">planetary nebula</a>\nphase.  A star can appear \"normal\" only so long as there\nare sufficient nuclear reactions in its core.  Soon thereafter,\ngravity will win out and compress the stellar core to higher temperatures.\n Eventually the core becomes a <a href=\"ap950910.html\">white dwarf</a>.\n These high temperatures somehow cause the expulsion of  star's\nouter layers, creating a <a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html\">planetary nebula</a>\nsuch as the <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1991MNRAS.251..284M\">Blue Snowball</a>\npictured above.  Although the Blue Snowball, also known as NGC\n7662, does appear blue, the <a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/W_F_P_C_2/\">above picture's colors</a>\nare not real and were chosen to highlight the emission of certain\nions in the nebula.  Many things are still not known about <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/twn/planetsx.html\">planetary nebula</a>,\nincluding details of the physical mechanism that creates the nebula,\nand the reason for fast knots of gas in the outer regions known\nas <a href=\"http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/W_F_P_C_2/\">fliers</a>.",
