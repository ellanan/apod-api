  "explanation": "<b></b>\n\nWhat's the closest\n<a href=\"http://www.obspm.fr:80/departement/darc/planets/encycl.html\">extrasolar planetary system</a>?\nIt may well be planets of the dim red dwarf star\n<a href=\"http://www.skypub.com/whatsup/lalande.html\">cataloged as Lalande 21185</a> -- a mere 8 light years distant.\n\n<a href=\"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ddgarber/l21185.htm\">This star is too faint</a>\nto be seen by the naked eye and its planets have not been\n<a href=\"http://techinfo.jpl.nasa.gov/WWW/ExNPS/HomePage.html\">imaged directly</a>.  Instead,\n<a href=\"http://www.obspm.fr:80/departement/darc/planets/overview.html\">their presence is inferred</a> by a long series\nof telescopic observations, tracking\nthe star as it wiggles and wobbles in mutual gravitational response to\nthe masses of its orbiting planets.\n\nOur own planetary system <a href=\"http://www.seti-inst.edu/\">would be detectable</a> by such a technique ...\n\nUsing data obtained from frequent observations of this star over the last\n50 years,\n<a href=\"http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~dhale/AO/ao.html\">University of Pitsburgh astronomer</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~dhale/AO/map_cat.html\">George Gatewood</a> recently announced that much of\n<a href=\"http://gag.observ-gr.fr:80/~listserv/exoplanets/0000.html\">Lalande 21185's wobble is most likely</a> due to\nan unseen planet with approximately\n90% of the mass of Jupiter and an orbital period of 5.8 years.\nHis work also indicates that\na second and possibly third planet of similar mass could\nwell be present in the system.\n\nMassive planets orbiting a red dwarf star would\n<a href=\"http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/science/sci1.html#fig1\">be very different from the Earth</a> -- as illustrated in\n<a href=\"http://www.empire.net/~whatmoug/Extrasolar/speculation_lalande.html\">this artist's vision</a> of a Jupiter-sized\nplanet with rings and moons lit by a cool, dim sun.\n\nNevertheless, the existence of\n<a href=\"lib/planetary_systems.html\">a planetary system</a>\nso near our own <a href=\"ap961017.html\">suggests</a> the\n<a href=\"http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/\">intriguing possibility that planets</a> are common in our galaxy.",
