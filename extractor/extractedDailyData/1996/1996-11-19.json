  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Our universe is a very dusty place.  <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">Dust</a>\nusually shows its presence by blocking out light emitted from\nstars or nebula behind it, sometimes creating the illusion of a\n<a href=\"ap961002.html\">horse's head</a> or a <a href=\"ap951109.html\">sombrero hat</a>.\n But nobody really knows what a typical interstellar dust grain\nlooks like.  By studying how dust absorbs, emits, and reflects\nlight, astronomers do know that interstellar dust is much different\nthan the cell and lint based dust found around a typical house.\n <a href=\"http://tycho.astro.gmu.edu/classes/a10695/notes/l08/l08.html\">Interstellar dust</a>\ngrains are <a href=\"http://www.aas.org/ApJ/v447n2/5150/sc0.html\">composed mostly</a>\nof <a href=\"http://www.tlchm.bris.ac.uk/~paulmay/spacdust/spacdust.htm\">carbon, silicon, and oxygen</a>\nand are usually less than about 1/1000 of a millimeter across.\nRecent work indicates that most <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1989ApJ...346L..89W\">dust grains are not spherical</a>.\n The above picture shows the result of a <a href=\"http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/fractals.html\">fractal adhesion model</a>\nfor dust grains involving random conglomerates of spherical compounds\nof different properties, here artificially highlighted by different\ncolors.",
