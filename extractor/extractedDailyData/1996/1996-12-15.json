  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: The famous \"Einstein Cross\" is a\ncase where a single object is seen four times. Here a very distant\n<a href=\"ap961125.html\">QSO</a> happened to be placed right behind\na <a href=\"ap950913.html\">massive galaxy</a>. The gravitational\neffect of the galaxy on the distant <a href=\"lib/quasars.html\">QSO</a>\nwas similar to the lens effect of an empty wine glass on a distant\nstreet light - it created multiple images. But stars in the foreground\ngalaxy have been found to act as <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/stsci/library/grav_lens/grav_lens.html\">gravitational lenses</a>\nhere too! These stars make the images change brightness relative\nto each other. These brightness changes are visible on these two\nphotographs of the <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1995PASP..107..469C\">Einstein Cross</a>,\ntaken about 3 years apart.",
