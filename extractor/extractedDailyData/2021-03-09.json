  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIs that a \n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6049883/\">fossil</a>?&nbsp;\n\nLooking through \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/\">recent images</a> of Mars taken by the new \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Perseverance rover</a> \nmay seem a bit like treasure hunting, \nwith the possibility of fame coming to the first person to correctly identify a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrifaction\">petrified</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.uky.edu/KGS/fossils/fossil-did-i-find-fossil-bones.php\">bone</a>, a rock imprinted by an \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#/media/File:Lycopod_axis.jpg\">ancient plant</a>, or any clear indication that life once existed on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a>.&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, even though it is possible that something as \nspectacular as a skeleton could be identified, most \n<a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/research/astrobiology-at-nasa/exobiology/\">exobiologists</a> think it much more likely that \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8863/searching-for-life-in-nasas-perseverance-mars-samples/\">biochemical remnants</a> of ancient single-celled \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism\">microbes</a> could be \n<a href=\"ap180619.html\">found</a> with \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/science/\">Perseverance's&nbsp;chemical analyzers</a>.&nbsp;\n\nA <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237436/\">key reason</a> \nis that \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism\">multicellular organisms</a> \nmay take a greater amount of \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AsBio..19..811W/abstract\">oxygen to evolve</a> than has \n<a href=\"https://www.space.com/33296-mars-atmosphere-oxygen-curiosity-rover.html\">ever been present</a> on Mars.\n\nThat said, \n<a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-known-animal-that-doesn-t-need-oxygen-to-survive\">nobody's sure</a>, so please feel free to digitally magnify any Perseverance image that interests you -- including the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25674/perseverances-mastcam-z-first-high-resolution-panorama/\">featured 360-degree zoomable image</a> of the \nrocks and ridges surrounding Perseverance's landing location in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezero_(crater)\">Jezero Crater</a>. \n\nAnd even though \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/team/\">NASA-affiliated scientists</a> \nare themselves studying Perseverance's images, \nif you see anything \n<a href=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/04/08/24/cat-4451003_1280.jpg\">really unusual</a>, please post it to \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nasamars/\">popular social media</a>.\n\nIf your sighting turns out to be \n<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/life-on-mars-78138144/\">particularly intriguing, scientifically</a>, \nit is likely that \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience\">NASA will hear</a> about it.",
