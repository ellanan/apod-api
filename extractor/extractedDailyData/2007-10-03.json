  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nSwinging inside the orbit of Mercury, on April 20th periodic\n<a href=\"http://cometography.com/pcomets/002p.html\">comet Encke</a>\nencountered a blast from the Sun in the form of a\n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml\">Coronal\nMass Ejection</a> (CME).\n\nWhen CMEs, enormous clouds of energetic particles ejected from\nthe Sun, slam into\nEarth's magnetosphere, they often trigger\n<a href=\"ap050916.html\">auroral displays</a>.\n\nBut in this case, the collison carried the tail of the comet away.\n\n<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/\n01oct_encke.htm\">The tail was</a> likely ripped off by interacting\nmagnetic fields rather than the mechanical pressure of the\n<a href=\"http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/Publications/\nVourlidas_encke_07.pdf\">collision</a>.\n\nClicking on the two panel image will play a movie gif of the\nremarkable event as recorded by the\n<a href=\"http://www.stereo.rl.ac.uk/science/project/\nindex.shtml\">Heliospheric Imager</a> onboard the\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/\nindex.html\">STEREO A spacecraft</a>.\n\nIn the movie, the time between frames is about 45 minutes,\nwhile the frames span about 14x20 million kilometers at the\ndistance of the comet.\n\nOf course, similar collisions have happened\nbefore as the ancient <a href=\"ap031223.html\">comet loops</a> through\nits 3.3 year solar <a href=\"ap051115.html\">orbit</a>.\n\nSo don't worry, Encke's\n<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/tail.html\">tail grows</a> back!",
