When it did, it was like someone turned on a lightswitch.\nI wish it would have lasted longer... [it] seemed like it was\ncompletely done in about 25 minutes.\"\n\nWatery reflections of the colorful show highlight the foreground\nin the stunning image while stars of the Big Dipper and the northern\nsky shine behind the dazzling\n<a href=\"http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~zaras/aurora.html\">Oklahoma\nauroral</a> display.",
