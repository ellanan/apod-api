  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nIn February of 1987, astronomers witnessed the brightest\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/supernovae.html\">supernova</a>\nof modern times -\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/feb4/sn1987anino.html\">supernova 1987A</a> in the\n<a href=\"ap951027.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap000206.html\">Mysterious rings</a> of material\nsurrounding the\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/97/03.html\">expanding stellar debris</a>\nwere soon emitting a visible glow excited by intense\nlight from the explosion.\n\nAfter fading over the intervening years, the interior ring\nhas just been seen to\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2000/11/\nanimation.html\">sprout</a> four new hotspots, as illustrated in\nthese two versions of a\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2000/11/pr.html\">Hubble Space Telescope image</a> recorded\non February 2nd.\n\nThe abrupt appearance of the new features suggests that\nmatter from the stellar blast wave itself has begun to\nslam into the ring in earnest, shock-heating the gas and producing\nthe bright hotspots.\n\nThe left-hand picture shows the glowing ring, initially excited\nby light from the explosion, along with the\nshocked hotspots.\n\nThe right-hand picture has been further computer enhanced\nto emphasize the hotspots.\n\nThe brightest spot at the right\n<a href=\"ap980217.html\">was first observed</a> in 1997, while the\nfour spots on the left half of the ring are new.\n\nAstronomers now eagerly anticipate a dramatic\n<a href=\"http://www.kidsnspace.org/\">rejuvenation</a>\nof the glowing ring as the bulk of the blast wave material,\ntraveling at about 60 million kilometers per hour,\ncontinues to plow into it.",
