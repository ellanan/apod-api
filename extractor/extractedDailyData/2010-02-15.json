  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf this is Saturn, where are the rings?  \n\nWhen Saturn's \"appendages\" \n<a href=\"http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html\">disappeared</a> \nin 1612, <a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html\">Galileo</a> did not understand why.   \n\nLater that century, it became understood that \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a>'s unusual protrusions were rings and that when the \n<a href=\"ap950801.html\">Earth crosses the ring plane</a>, \nthe edge-on rings will appear to disappear.  \n\nThis is because Saturn's rings are confined to a <a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_kids/AskKids/saturnrings.shtml\">plane many times thinner</a>, in proportion, than a \n\n<a href=\"http://www.quikshave.com/timeline.htm\">razor blade</a>.  \n\nIn modern times, the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm\">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn now also crosses \n<a href=\"ap040117.html\">Saturn's ring</a> plane.  \n\nA series of plane crossing images from 2005 February \nwas dug out of the vast \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/index.cfm\">online Cassini raw image</a> archive by interested Spanish amateur \nFernando Garcia Navarro.  \n\nPictured above, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, \nis the striking result.  \n\n<a href=\"ap080720.html\">Saturn's thin ring plane</a> \nappears in blue, bands and clouds in \n<a href=\"ap041102.html\">Saturn's upper atmosphere</a> \nappear in gold.\n\nSince Saturn just \n<a href=\"ap091110.html\">passed its equinox</a>, today the ring plane is pointed close to the Sun and the rings could not cast the high \n<a href=\"ap090901.html\">dark shadows</a> seen across the top of this image, taken back in 2005.\n\nMoons appear as bumps in the rings.",
