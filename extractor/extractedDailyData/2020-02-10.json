  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's happening behind that camel?\n\nA partial eclipse of the Sun.\n\nAbout six and a half weeks ago, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> passed completely in front of \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> as seen from a narrow band on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a>.\n\nDespite (surely) many \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel\">camel</a>s being located in \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2019-december-26\">this narrow band</a>, only one found itself \nstationed between this camera, the \n<a href=\"ap191012.html\">distant Moon</a>, and the even more \n<a href=\"ap150512.html\">distant Sun</a>.\n\nTo create \n<a href=\"https://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and-explore/a/tips-and-techniques/photographing-an-annular-solar-eclipse-in-the-desert.html\">this impressive superposition</a>, though, took a well-planned trip to the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates\">United Arab Emirates</a>, careful alignments, \nand accurate timings on the day of the eclipse. \n\nAlthough the resulting featured image shows a \n<a href=\"ap180211.html\">partially eclipsed Sun</a> rising, \nthe Moon went on to appear \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a6/be/1d/a6be1d2075df115431480c4dd11bcae7.jpg\">completely engulfed</a> by the Sun in an \n<a href=\"https://www.beingintheshadow.com/2013/05/07/annular-versus-total-solar-eclipse/\">annular eclipse</a> known as a \n<a href=\"ap200113.html\">ring of fire</a>. \n\nForward scattering of sunlight, dominated by quantum mechanical \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/03_behaviors\">diffraction</a>, gives the camel hair and rope fray an unusual glow. \n\nThe next solar eclipse is also an \n<a href=\"ap170302.html\">annular eclipse</a> and will occur \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_June_21,_2020\">this coming June</a>.",
