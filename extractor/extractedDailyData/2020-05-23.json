  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nStars shine and satellites glint in this clear, dark, night sky\nover Wannon Falls Reserve, South West Victoria, Australia.\n\nIn fact the fuzzy, faint apparition above the tree tops is the only\ncloud visible, also known as the\n<a href=\"ap190905.html\">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>,\nsatellite galaxy of our own Milky Way.\n\nIn the foreground, an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalotus_nidiformis\">Omphalotus nidiformis</a>\n(ghost fungus) from\n<a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/earth-now/#/\">planet Earth</a>\nshines with a surprisingly bright\n<a href=\"ap140830.html\">bioluminescence</a>.\n\nLike the Magellanic cloud, the ghost fungus was easily seen with the eye.\n\nIts ghostly glow was actually a dull green, but it appears\nbright green in digital camera picture.\n\nTwo images were blended to create the scene.\n\nOne focused on the distant stars and Large Magellanic Cloud some 160,000\nlight-years away.\n\nAnother was focused on the foreground and glowing fungus several\n<a href=\"ap131101.html\">light-nanoseconds from the camera lens</a>.",
