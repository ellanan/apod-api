  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLook through the cosmic cloud cataloged as NGC 281\nand you might miss the stars of open cluster\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AJ....113.2116G\">IC 1590</a>.\n\nStill, formed\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/ngc281/\">within\nthe nebula</a> that cluster's young, massive stars\nultimately power the pervasive\n<a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/\nemission_nebulae.html\">nebular glow</a>.\n\nThe eye-catching shapes looming in\n<a href=\"http://www.imagingdeepsky.com/Nebulae/Pacman/NGC281.htm\">this\nportrait of NGC 281</a> are sculpted columns and dense\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/13/index.html\">dust globules</a>\nseen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation\nfrom the hot cluster stars.\n\nIf they survive long enough,\nthe dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/pacman/\">Playfully called</a>\nthe Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape,\nNGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/\">Cassiopeia</a>.\n\nThis sharp composite image was made through\n<a href=\"ap071102.html\">narrow-band</a> filters,\ncombining emission from the nebula's hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen\natoms in green, red, and blue hues.\n\nIt spans over 80 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 281.",
