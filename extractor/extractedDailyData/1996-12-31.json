  "explanation": "<b>Explanation</b>: Are any volcanoes on Io currently erupting?\n To help answer this, scientists instructed the <a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/spacecraft.html\">robot spacecraft Galileo</a>\nto take <a href=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/122096.html\">hourly pictures of this moon</a>\nof <a href=\"ap951206.html\">Jupiter</a> prior to its most recent\nencounter.  The most obvious changes in Io are due to the changing\namount of sunlight reflected from the moon to the spacecraft.\n More careful inspection does verify continuous <a href=\"ap960805.html\">volcanic plumes</a>.\n The most prominent plume visible is from Prometheus, visible\njust below <a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/io.html\">Io</a>'s\nequator.  This plume was first photographed in 1979 by <a href=\"http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html\">Voyager</a>,\nso Prometheus appears to have been erupting continuously for at\nleast 18 years!
