  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nColourful star trails arc through the night in this wide-angle mountain and\nskyscape.\n\n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/\">From a rotating planet</a>,\nthe digitally added consecutive exposures\nwere made with a camera fixed to a tripod and looking south,\nover northern Iran's\n<a href=\"ap070203.html\">Alborz Mountain</a> range.\n\nThe stars trace concentric arcs around the planet's\n<a href=\"ap120802.html\">south celestial pole</a>,\nbelow the scene's rugged horizon.\n\nCombined, the many short exposures also bring out the pretty star colours.\n\nBluish trails are from stars hotter than our Sun,\nwhile yellowish trails are from cooler stars.\n\nNear the center, the remarkably pinkish trail was traced by the\nstar-forming\n<a href=\"ap170329.html\">Orion Nebula</a>.",
