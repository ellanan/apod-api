  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIf you could look at Venus with radar eyes - this is what you might see.\n\nThis computer reconstruction of the surface of \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/venus.html\">Venus</a> \nwas created from data from the \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/magellan.html\">Magellan \nspacecraft</a>.  \n\nMagellan orbited \n<a href=\"ap970507.html\">Venus</a> \nand used radar to map our neighboring planet's surface between 1990 and 1994.\nMagellan found many interesting surface features, including the \n<a href=\"ap950823.html\">large circular domes</a>, typically \n25-kilometers across, that are \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/mgn_alpha_regio.txt\">depicted \nabove</a>.  Volcanism is thought to have created the domes, although the \nprecise mechanism remains unknown. \n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/venus.htm\">Venus</a>' \nsurface is so hot and hostile that no \n<a href=\"ap950927.html\">surface probe</a> has lasted more than a few minutes.",
