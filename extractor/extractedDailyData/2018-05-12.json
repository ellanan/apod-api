  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nA recent informal poll found that astronomers don't yet have a good\n<a href=\"https://www.latitudegroup.com/blog/collective-nouns/\">collective\nnoun</a> for a group of black holes,\nbut they need one.\n\nThe red circles in this\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2018/sgra_swarm/\">Chandra\nObservatory X-ray image</a>\nidentify a group of a dozen black holes that\nare members of binary star systems.\n\nWith 5 to 30 times the mass of the Sun, the black hole binaries\nare swarming within about 3 light-years of\n<a href=\"ap180122.html\">the center of our galaxy</a>\nwhere the supermassive black hole identified as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*)\nresides.\n\nYellow circles indicate\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomycast.com/2009/05/\nep-135-x-ray-astronomy/\">X-ray</a> sources that are likely less massive\nneutron stars or white dwarf stars in binary star systems.\n\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/learn_bh.html\">Alone, black holes</a>\nwould be invisible, but as part of a\nbinary star system they accrete material from their\nnormal companion star and generate X-rays.\n\nAt the distance of the galactic center\nChandra can detect only the brighter of these black hole binary systems\nas point-like sources of X-rays,\nhinting that many fainter X-ray emitting black hole binaries\nshould exist there,\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01543\">as yet undetected</a>.",
