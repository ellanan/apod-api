  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nA black hole glides silently through space.  \nIs there any way to know it's there?  \n\nUntil last week, all objects that might be \n<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/BlackHoles.html\">black holes</a> in \n<a href=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/mw.html\">our Galaxy</a> were part of \n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star</a> systems.  \n\nThere, gas from the companion star was hypothesized to \n<a href=\"ap970115.html\">swirl around the black hole</a>, \nheat up, and emit \n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/glossary.html#x-ray\">X-rays</a> before falling in.  \n\nLast week, however, analysis was <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2000/03/content/prc0003.txt\">released</a> of a mysteriously dark object \nthat floated in front of a distant background star, \ndramatically increasing this star's light by the \n<a href=\"ap970105.html\">lens effect of its gravity</a>, as \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2000/03/index.html\">pictured above</a>.\n\nThe high mass and low light of this \n<a href=\"ap960202.html\">strange lens</a> \nhave astronomers guessing they might just have \ndetected a lone \n<a href=\"http://library.thinkquest.org/12676/\">black hole</a>, \nweighing in at six times the mass of our Sun.  \n\nThe existence of isolated black holes \nis not in itself surprising, \nas they should be the <a href=\"http://observe.ivv.nasa.gov/nasa/space/stellardeath/stellardeath_opening.html\">end result of the cores of massive stars</a>.",
