  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat did the Huygens probe see as it descended toward Saturn's Moon Titan?\n\nIn January the \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm\">robot \nCassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting \n<a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> \nreleased a probe through the dense cloud decks of one of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System\">Solar System</a>'s most mysterious moons.  \n\nBelow the clouds, as it descended, the probe took images of the \n<a href=\"ap050119.html\">approaching surface</a> as well as several \n<a href=\"ap050117.html\">images from the surface</a> itself.  \n\nMany of the <a href=\"http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/titanraw/index.htm\">images</a> have now been digitally merged and scaled into the \nabove perspective from 3,000 meters high. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMWTY5TI8E_0.html\">above stereographic projection</a> shows a 360-degree wide-angle view \nof the surface of <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/titan.html\">Titan</a>. \n\nThe bright areas toward the top and left of the image are thought to be relatively high ground laced with \n<a href=\"ap050124.html\">drainage channels cut by rivers</a> of methane.  \n\nThe bright shapes on the right are now \n<a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20050513.cfm\">hypothesized</a> to be ridges of ice gravel.  \n\n<a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=12\">Huygen</a>'s landing site, labeled, appears to be on a type \nof dark dry lakebed, once fed by a large dark flow channel on the left.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments-huygens.cfm\">Huygen's probe</a> lasted an unexpectedly long three hours on \n<a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_blog.html\">Titan</a>'s \nharsh <a href=\"ap050117.html\">surface</a>.",
