  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nLike a ship plowing through cosmic seas,\n<a href=\"ap061124.html\">runaway star</a> Zeta Ophiuchi\nproduces the arcing interstellar bow wave or bow shock seen in this\n<a href=\"http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/\ngallery_zeta_ophiuchi.html\">stunning infrared portrait</a>\nfrom the WISE spacecraft.\n\nIn the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more\nmassive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving\ntoward the top at 24 kilometers per <i>second</i>.\n\nIts strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty\n<a href=\"http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html\">interstellar\nmaterial</a> and shaping the curved shock front.\n\nAround it are clouds of relatively undisturbed material.\n\nWhat set this star in motion?\n\nZeta Oph was likely once a member of a\n<a href=\"ap970219.html\">binary star system</a>, its\ncompanion star was more massive and hence\n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/teachers/lessons/\nxray_spectra/background-lifecycles.html\">shorter lived</a>.\n\nWhen the companion\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova\">exploded\nas a supernova</a> catastrophically losing mass,\nZeta Oph was flung out of the system.\n\nAbout 460 light-years away, Zeta Oph is 65,000 times more\nluminous than the Sun and would be one of the brighter stars\nin the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring dust.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/education_class.html\">WISE</a>\nimage spans about 1.5 degrees or 12 light-years\nat the estimated distance of\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/zetaoph.html\">Zeta Ophiuchi</a>.",
