  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere do comet tails come from?\n\nAlthough it is common knowledge that \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/09/Rosetta_comet_observed_with_Very_Large_Telescope\">comet tails and comas</a> originate from comet nuclei, \nexactly how that happens is an \n<a href=\"http://www.planet-science.com/media/32412/scientists%20looking%20at%20chicken%20in%20laboratory_82770182_244x183.jpg\">active topic of research</a>. \n\nOne of the best images yet of \n<a href=\"ap101123.html\">emerging jets</a> is shown in the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/01/Comet_activity_22_November_2014\">featured image</a>, taken last November by the \n<a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Europe_s_comet_chaser\">robotic Rosetta spacecraft</a> in orbit around the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko\">Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a> (Comet CG), and released last month. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/01/Comet_activity_22_November_2014\">overexposed picture</a> shows plumes of gas and dust escaping numerous places from the \n<a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/01/16/fine-structure-in-the-comets-jets/\">Comet CG's nucleus</a> as it nears the Sun and heats up. \n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"http://www.livecometdata.com/comets/67p-churyumov-gerasimenko/\">Comet CG is currently</a> further out from the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun\">Sun</a> than \n<a href=\"ap140511.html\">Mars</a>, its orbit will take it almost as close as the Earth this coming August, at which time its \n<a href=\"ap961113.html\">jet activity</a> is expected to increase by a factor of about 100.\n\nYou've likely seen some debris from \n<a href=\" http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/small-bodies/comets-visited-by-spacecraft-2014.html\">comet nuclei</a> before but in another form -- when sand-sized bits end their journey through the Solar System by impacting the atmosphere of Earth as \n<a href=\"ap121119.html\">meteors</a>.",
