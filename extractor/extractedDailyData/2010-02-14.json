  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhat surrounds the florid Rosette nebula?  \n\nTo better picture this area of the sky, the\n<a href=\"ap070214.html\">famous flowery</a>\n<a href=\"emission_nebulae.html\">emission nebula</a>\non the far right has been captured recently in a deep and\ndramatic wide field image that features several other sky highlights.\n\nDesignated NGC 2237, the center of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_Nebula\">Rosette nebula</a> is populated by the bright blue stars of\n<a href=\"ap020317.html\">open cluster NGC 2244</a>, whose\n<a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml\">winds</a>\nand energetic light are evacuating the nebula's center.\n\nBelow the famous flower, a symbol of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_day\">Valentine's Day</a>, is a\n<a href=\"ap080214.html\">column of dust and gas</a> that appears like a rose's stem but extends hundreds of light years.\n\nAcross the\n<a href=\"http://deepskycolors.com/pics/astro/2009/12/mg_2009-12-01_RosetteConeWF_HaRRGB.jpg?\">above image</a>, the bright blue star just left and below the center is called\n<a href=\"http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/15mon.html\">S Monocerotis</a>.  \n\nThe star is part of the <a href=\"open_clusters.html\">open cluster</a>\nof stars labelled NGC 2264 and known as the\n<a href=\"ap070509.html\">Snowflake cluster</a>.\n\nTo the right of S Mon is a dark pointy featured called the\n<a href=\"ap040529.html\">Cone nebula</a>, a nebula likely shaped by winds flowing out a massive star obscured by dust.\n\nTo the left of S Mon is the\n<a href=\"ap080422.html\">Fox Fur nebula</a>, a <a href=\"ap081123.html\">tumultuous region</a> created by the rapidly evolving Snowflake cluster.\n\nThe Rosette region, at about 5,000\n<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> distant, is about twice as far away as the region surrounding S Mon.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap090411.html\">entire field</a>\ncan be seen with a small telescope toward the\nconstellation of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn\">Unicorn</a>\n(<a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/monoceros.html\">Monoceros</a>).",
