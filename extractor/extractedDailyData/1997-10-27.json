  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIt's a clash of the titans.  Two galaxies are squaring off in \n<a href=\"http://astro.gmu.edu/constellation/CRV.html\">Corvus</a> and \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/34/b.html\">here</a> are the latest pictures.  When two \n<a href=\"ap971022.html\">galaxies collide</a>, however, \nthe stars that compose them usually do not.   \nThis is because \n<a href=\"ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text\">galaxies</a> are mostly empty space and, however bright, \nstars only take up only a small amount of that space.  \nBut during the slow, hundred million year \n<a href=\"ap951228.html\">collision</a>, one galaxy \ncan rip the other apart gravitationally, and \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a> \nand gas common to both galaxies does collide.  In the \n<a href=\"ap970602.html\">above wreckage</a>, \ndark \n<a href=\"ap970119.html\">dust pillars</a> mark massive molecular clouds, \nwhich are being compressed during the \n<a href=\"ap951115.html\">galactic encounter</a>, \ncausing the \n<a href=\"ap970506.html\">rapid birth of millions of stars</a>.",
