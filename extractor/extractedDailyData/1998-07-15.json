  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nHow do you find a nearly invisible galaxy?  \nPictured above is the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy <a href=\"http://wwwatnf.atnf.csiro.au/people/bkoribal/n2915.html\">NGC 2915</a>.  In visible light, shown above in yellow, \nthis galaxy appears to be a normal \n<a href=\"ap960519.html\">dwarf galaxy</a>, \nas indicated by the yellow smudge in the image center.  \n\nYet when imaged in a very specific color, \nshown in blue, a whole \n<a href=\"ap980525.html\">spiral galaxy</a> appears.  \n\nThis specific color is in the \n<a href=\"ap971214.html\">radio band</a> \nand is preferentially emitted by neutral \n<a href=\"http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/1.html\">hydrogen</a> atoms.  Much about \n<a href=\"http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~meurer/hibcd.html\">BCD galaxies</a> remains mysterious, \nsuch as how the neutral hydrogen obtained its shape, \nwhat drives current star formation, \nand why there is so much \n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Xray/dark_matter.html\">dark matter</a>.  \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E111%2E1551M&amp;db_key=AST\">NGC 2915</a> is located at the relatively nearby distance of 15 million light-years - just outside our \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/local.html\">Local Group of Galaxies</a>.",
