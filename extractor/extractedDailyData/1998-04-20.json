  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nCan you name this satellite?  In December, NASA's third\nGreat Observatory is planned for launch.\n\nThe two NASA Great Observatories currently in orbit are the \n<a href=\"ap950810.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and the \n<a href=\"ap950811.html\">Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory</a>, both now\nnamed for \n<a href=\"ap960217.html\">famous</a> \n<a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/descriptions/theman.html\">scientists</a>.\nBut after whom should the \n<a href=\"http://www.trw.com/seg/sats/AXAF.html\">Advanced \nX-ray Astrophysics Facility</a> (AXAF)\nbe named?  If your submitted suggestion conforms with \n<a href=\"http://asc.harvard.edu/contest.html\">contest rules</a> \nand is chosen, you will have named the\nmost powerful X-ray satellite ever built, and may even\nwin a prize. \n\n<a href=\"http://snail.msfc.nasa.gov/AXAF/AXAF.html\">AXAF</a> \nis the size of a bus, has \n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Axaf/telescope.html\">strange mirrors</a> polished to\natomic smoothness, and will produce \n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Xray/xrays.html\">X-ray</a>\nimages five times clearer of objects twice as faint as \nany previous X-ray satellite.  \n\nThis should allow \n<a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/pub.html\">AXAF</a> \nthe ability to see <a href=\"http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/Edu/Teacher.html\">X-rays</a> emitted near small \n<a href=\"ap970115.html\">black holes</a>, from distant \n<a href=\"ap980409.html\">active galaxies</a>, and \ninside huge \n<a href=\"ap971213.html\">clusters of galaxies</a>.\n\nAstronomers now hope for an uneventful launch, routine operations,\nand spectacular discoveries.",
