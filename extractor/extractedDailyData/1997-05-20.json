  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe Egg Nebula is taking a beating.  Like a baby chick pecking its \nway out of an egg, the star in the center of the\n<a href=\"ap960129.html\">Egg Nebula</a> is casting away shells of gas and \n<a href=\"ap961119.html\">dust</a> as it slowly transforms itself into a \n<a href=\"ap961203.html\">white dwarf star</a>. The \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/11.html\">above picture</a> \nwas taken by the newly installed \n<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/NICMOS/topnicmos.html\">Near \nInfrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer</a> (NICMOS) now on board the \n<a href=\"ap970306.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  A thick torus of \ndust now surrounds the star through which the shell gas is escaping.  \nNewly expelled gas shells escape in beams as can be seen in the \n<a href=\"ap960129.html\">original HST image</a> and in the recently released \n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/11/background.html\">image \nshown above</a>.  This  infrared image is coded in false color to highlight \ntwo different types of emission.  The red light represents hot hydrogen gas \nheated by the collisions of expanding shells.  The blue light represents light \nfrom the central star scattered by the \n<a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dust</a> in the nebula.  \nIt takes light about 3000 years to reach us from the \n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1989MNRAS%2E238P%2E%2E37P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1\">Egg Nebula</a>,  which is hundreds of times the size of our \n<a href=\"ap961214.html\">Solar System</a>.",
