  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nJust fix your camera to a tripod and you too can make an image of graceful trails traced by the stars as planet Earth rotates on its axis. \n\nMaking a time lapse video like that \n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/HawaiianStarlight/APOD/Hawaiian_Starlight_RotatingStarfield-APOD.html\">shown above</a> may require more effort, though.\n\nMade on 2006 October 13 from \n<a href=\"ap090219.html\">Mauna Kea</a>, \n<a href=\"ap020427.html\">Hawaii</a>, \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/HawaiianStarlight/APOD/Hawaiian_Starlight_RotatingStarfield-APOD.html\">this video</a> nicely captured what you might see of the night sky if you could keep your brain from changing your \n<a href=\"http://www.100fps.com/how_many_frames_can_humans_see.htm\">perceived visual image</a> about every hundredth of a second.\n\nStarting from a dark sky and point-like stars, the video demonstrates how stars appear to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_motion\">move over the night</a> as the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_World_Turns\">world turns</a>.\n\nNear the center of the developing \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullseye_(target)\">bull's-eye</a> \npattern is \n<a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a>, the North Star.  \n\nVisible in the left foreground is the 3.7-meter aperture \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFHT\">Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope</a> (CFHT).\n\nThe red glow that illuminated the \n<a href=\"ap000905.html\">CFHT dome</a> near the beginning of the film was created by a car leaving the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea\">volcanic summit</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap031203.html\">Moon rose</a> about half way through the video and created a white glow that gradually illuminated most of the CFHT dome.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/HawaiianStarlight/APOD/Hawaiian_Starlight_RotatingStarfield-APOD.html\">above remarkable time-lapse video</a> was constructed from about 1,000 consecutive frames taken with a digital camera over nearly nine hours.",
