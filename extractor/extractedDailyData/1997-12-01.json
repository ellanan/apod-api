  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOrion is big.  Some of the stars that form the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html\">constellation of Orion</a> are part of a giant gas cloud \ncomplex that stretches over 100 light years and \nappears more than 50 times the diameter of the Moon.  \nComponents of this cloud include the \n<a href=\"ap971025.html\">Horsehead Nebula</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap970511.html\">Orion Nebula</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap971118.html\">Trapezium</a> \n<a href=\"ap970128.html\">open cluster</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap961017.html\">small disks</a> \ncontaining stellar systems which are just forming.  \nAt 1500 light years, \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n1976x.html\">Orion</a> is the closest star forming region to Earth.  \nClose inspection of the photo's center should reveal the \nthree stars which form the \n<a href=\"http://www.adler.uchicago.edu/ISE/ORION4.HTM\">belt of Orion</a>.",
