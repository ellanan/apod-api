  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe odd looking \"creature\" to the\nright of center in the above photo is a gas cloud known as a <a href=\"http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1994PASP..106.1018S\">cometary globule</a>.\nThis globule, however, has ruptured. \nCometary <a href=\"ap980921.html\">globules</a>\nare typically characterized by <a href=\"lib/glossary.html#dust\">dusty</a>\nheads and elongated tails. \n\nThese features cause cometary globules\nto have visual similarities to \n<a href=\"ap950826.html\">comets</a>,\nbut in reality they are very much different. \n\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...463L.105M&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=34f6e1de7f06091\">Cometary globules</a>\nare frequently the birthplaces of <a href=\"ap950620.html\">stars</a>,\nand many show very young stars in their heads. The reason for\nthe rupture in the head of this object is not completely known.\nThe <a href=\"ap961101.html\">galaxy</a> to the left of center\nis very far in the distance and is only placed near CG4 by chance\nsuperposition.",
