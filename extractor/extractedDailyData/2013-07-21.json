  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSince <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn's</a> axis is tilted as it orbits the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\">Sun</a>, \nSaturn has <a href=\"http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/\nSseason.htm\">seasons</a>, like those of planet Earth ...\nbut Saturn's seasons last for over seven years.\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2001/15/image/a/\">So what season</a> is it on Saturn now?\n\nOrbiting the equator, the tilt of the\n<a href=\"http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html\">rings\nof Saturn</a> provides quite a graphic seasonal display.\n\nEach year until 2016, Saturn's rings will be increasingly apparent\nafter appearing <a href=\"ap090904.html\">nearly edge-on</a> in 2009.\n\nThe <a href=\"ap020215.html\">ringed planet</a>\nis also well placed in <a href=\"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury\">evening skies</a> providing a <a href=\"http://www.astronomerswithoutborders.org/tdtes-saturn-mosaic-project.html\">grand view</a> \nas summer comes to <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/97128/changing-hues-signal-transition-of-seasons-at-saturn/\">Saturn</a>'s northern \nhemisphere and winter to the south.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope took the above\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/2001/15/\">sequence\nof images</a> about a year apart, starting on the\nleft in 1996 and ending on the right in 2000.  \n\nAlthough they look solid, Saturn's Rings are likely\n<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984Sci...223..396Z\">less than 50 meters thick</a> and\nconsist of individually orbiting bits of ice and rock ranging in size from grains of sand to barn-sized boulders.",
