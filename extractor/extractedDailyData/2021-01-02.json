  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nIn the mid 19th century, one of the first photographic technologies used\nto record the lunar surface was the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodion_process\">wet-plate collodion</a>\nprocess, notably employed by British astronomer\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_De_la_Rue\">Warren De la Rue</a>.\n\nTo capture an image, a thick, transparent mixture was\nused to coat a glass plate, sensitized with silver\nnitrate, exposed at the telescope, and then developed\nto create a negative image on the plate.\n\nTo maintain photographic sensitivity,\nthe entire process, from coating to exposure to developing, had to be\ncompleted before the plate dried, in a span of about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nThis modern version of a wet-plate collodion\n<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/786096?&amp;exhibitionId=%7b1db98082-524d-46fe-93ee-3ba6436c0acb%7d&amp;oid=786096&amp;pkgids=578&amp;pg=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=23&amp;ft=*&amp;offset=20\">image celebrates</a>\nlunar photography's early days, reproducing\n<a href=\"https://unblinkingeye.com/Articles/WPC/wpc.html\">the process</a> \nusing modern\nchemicals to coat a glass plate from a\n<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/eastman-wet-plate-photography/\">21st century</a>\nhardware store.\n\nCaptured last November 28 with an 8x10 view camera and backyard telescope,\nit faithfully records large craters, bright rays,\nand dark, smooth mare of the\n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/Gallery/moonphase.html\">waxing gibbous Moon</a>.\n\nSubsequently digitized, the image on the plate was 8.5 centimeters in\ndiameter and exposed while tracking for 2 minutes.\n\nThe wet plate's effective photographic sensitivity was about ISO 1. \n\nIn your smart phone, the camera sensor probably has a photographic\nsensitivity range of ISO 100 to 6400 (and\n<a href=\"https://www.wetplateday.org/galleries/\">needs to be</a>\nkept dry ...).",
