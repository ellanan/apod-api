  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nSpiral galaxy NGC 3169 looks to be unraveling like a ball of cosmic\nyarn.\n\nIt lies some 70 million light-years away,\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso1114a/\">south of</a>\nbright star Regulus toward the faint constellation Sextans.\n\nWound up spiral arms are pulled out into sweeping tidal\ntails as NGC 3169 (left) and neighboring NGC 3166\n<a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-ngc3166/\">interact\ngravitationally</a>.\n\nEventually the galaxies will merge into one,\na common fate even for bright galaxies in\n<a href=\"ap120604.html\">the local universe</a>.\n\nDrawn out stellar arcs and plumes are clear\nindications of the ongoing gravitational interactions\nacross the deep and colorful\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/leoii.html\">galaxy\ngroup</a> photo.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/ai8tao/\">The telescopic frame</a>\nspans about 20 arc minutes or about 400,000 light-years\nat the group's estimated distance, and includes smaller, bluish NGC 3165\nto the right.\n\nNGC 3169 is also known to shine across the spectrum from\nradio to X-rays,\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4382\">harboring</a>\nan active galactic nucleus that is the\nsite of a supermassive black hole.",
