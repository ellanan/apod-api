  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nRocks from space hit Earth every day.  \n\nThe larger the rock, though, the less often Earth is struck.  \n\nMany kilograms of space dust pitter to Earth daily.\nLarger bits appear initially as a bright <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/in-depth/\">meteor</a>.  \n\nBaseball-sized rocks and ice-balls\nstreak through our atmosphere daily,\nmost evaporating quickly to nothing.  \n\n<a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/\">Significant threats</a> \ndo exist for rocks near 100 meters in diameter, which\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater#/media/File:Meteorcrater.jpg\">strike the Earth</a> roughly every 1000 years.  \n\nAn object this size could cause \n<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-020-04086-6\">significant tsunamis</a> were it to strike an ocean,\n<a href=\"https://astronomy.com/news/2020/12/common-misconceptions-about-doomsday-asteroid-impacts\">potentially devastating</a> even distant shores.\n\nA collision with a <a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/size-of-asteroids-alvaro-gracia-montoya/\">massive asteroid</a>,\nover 1 km across, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event#/media/File:SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg\">is more rare</a>,\noccurring typically millions of years apart, but\n<a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/intro.html\">could have truly global consequences</a>.\n\nMany asteroids remain\n<a href=\"https://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/\">undiscovered</a>.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/image/616/category/39-asteroids\">featured image</a>, one such asteroid -- shown by the long \nblue streak -- was found by chance \nin 1998 by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nA <a href=\"ap050308.html\">collision</a> with a large asteroid  \nwould not \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Wrc4fHSCpw\">affect Earth</a>'s orbit so much as\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95tmYmeHf84\">raise dust</a>\nthat would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_winter\">affect Earth's climate</a>.  \n\nOne likely result is a global extinction of many species of life,\npossibly dwarfing the ongoing\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction\">extinction occurring now</a>.",
