  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nIt may look like some sort of cute alien robot, but it was created here on Earth, launched to the Moon in 1970, and now reflects laser light in a scientifically useful way.\n\nOn November 17, 1970 the Soviet\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1970-095A\">Luna 17</a> spacecraft landed the first roving remote-controlled robot\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunartimeline.html\">on the Moon</a>.\n\nKnown as\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_1\">Lunokhod 1</a>,\nit weighed just under 2,000 pounds and was\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/\nlunokhod-mission.jpg\">designed to operate</a> for 90 days while\nguided in real-time by a five person team near Moscow, USSR.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_1\">Lunokhod 1 toured</a>\nthe lunar Sea of Rains (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Imbrium\">Mare Imbrium</a>) for 11 months in one of the \n<a href=\"http://www.mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogMoon.htm\">greatest successes</a> of the\n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunarussr.html\">Soviet lunar exploration program</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gI0BlBHACM\">Lunokhod</a>'s operations officially ceased in 1971.\n\nEarlier this year, however, the <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/03jun_oldrover/\">position of the rover was recovered</a> by NASA's moon-orbiting\n<a href=\"ap090622.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>.  \n\nGiven that position, laser pulses from Earth were successfully bounced off the old robot's reflector.  \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment\">Bouncing laser pulses</a> off of this and other lunar reflectors could yield range data to the moon accurate enough to track millimeter-sized\n<a href=\"ap051113.html\">deviations</a> in the Moon's orbit, effectively probing lunar composition and testing gravitational theories.",
