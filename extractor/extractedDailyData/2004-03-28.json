  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nSeemingly adrift in a\n<a href=\"http://www.heavensgloryobservatory.com/\">cosmic sea</a>\nof stars and gas, this delicate, floating apparition is \ncataloged as NGC 7635 -- The <a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1998/31/index.html\">Bubble Nebula</a>.\n\nIn this wide-angle view, the Bubble nebula\n<a href=\"http://www.astropix.com/HTML/E_SUM_N/BUBBLE.HTM\">lies</a> \nat the center of a larger complex of shocked glowing gas about 11,000\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year\">light-years</a>\ndistant in the fair constellation\n<a href=\"http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/\">Cassiopeia</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/1998/31/fast_facts.html\">NGC 7635</a>\nreally is an interstellar bubble, blown by winds from the brightest star \n<a href=\"ap000118.html\">visible within</a> the bubble's boundary.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.physics.brocku.ca/courses/1f00/Nebulae/Bubble/\">bubble's expansion</a> is constrained by the surrounding material.\n\nAbout 10 light-years in diameter, if the Bubble nebula were centered on the Sun, \nthe Sun's <a href=\"ap010318.html\">nearest stellar neighbor</a>,\nAlpha Centauri, would also be enclosed.\n\nThis breathtaking picture is a combination of telescopic\ndigital images made through broad color filters\nalong with a narrow filter intended to transmit only the red\n<a href=\"ap020822.html\">light emitted</a> by excited hydrogen atoms.",
