  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nNGC1850 is a large cluster of stars located a mere 166,000 light-years\nfrom Earth in our neighboring galaxy\n<a href=\"ap000222.html\">the Large Magellanic Cloud</a> (LMC).\n\nThe\n<a href=\"http://aibn47.astro.uni-bonn.de/~gallery/articles/\ncolor.html\">colors</a> in this beautiful\n<a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/94/40.html\">Hubble Space\nTelescope composite image</a> of the\n<a href=\"ap990312.html\">cluster reveal</a> different\npopulations of stars.\n\nYellowish stars are the main cluster stars, sun-like main sequence\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/msblues.html\">hydrogen burners</a> about 50 million years old.\n\nThe white stars are massive, hotter, and younger,\nabout 4 million years old.\n\nRadiating strongly in ultraviolet light,\nthey represent a loose\n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/cluster.html\">cluster</a>\nthemselves, perhaps within 200 light-years of the main cluster.\n\n<a href=\"ap960509.html\">Massive stars</a>\nwhich formed in the older main cluster\nhave long since disappeared,\nending their lives in\n<a href=\"ap970225.html\">spectacular supernova explosions</a>.\n\nDid expanding debris from these supernovae\n<a href=\"ap000219.html\">trigger the formation</a>\nof the nearby younger cluster?\n\nProbably so.\n\nIn any event, a few million years from now a\nsimilar fate awaits the massive stars of the younger cluster -\nburning brightly but briefly before they explode sending new\n<a href=\"ap990725.html\">clouds of stellar debris</a> into space.",
