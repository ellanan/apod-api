The \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/messier/more/SagdEg.html\">Sagittarius Dwarf</a> (Sgr), shown as the extended irregular\nshape below the Galactic Center,  \nis the closest of 9 known small \n<a href=\"http://www.astro.uu.se/~ns/review.html\">dwarf spheroidal</a> galaxies that orbit our Galaxy.  \nDon't worry, our Galaxy is not in danger, \nbut no such assurances are issued for the \nSagittarius Dwarf: the intense gravitational \ntidal forces might pull it apart.  Oddly, however, \n<a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9612025\">Sgr's orbit</a> indicates that is has been through \nour Galaxy several times before, and survived!  \nOne possibility is that Sgr contains a great deal of \nlow-density <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/matter.html\">dark matter</a> that hold it together \ngravitationally during these collisions.",
