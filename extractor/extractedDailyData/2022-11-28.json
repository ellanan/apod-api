  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere will the next meteor appear?\n\nEven during a meteor shower, it is practically impossible to know.\n\nTherefore, a good way to enjoy a \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/en/\">meteor shower</a> is to find a place where you can \nsit comfortably and monitor a great expanse of dark sky.\n\nAnd it may be satisfying to share this experience with a friend. \n\nThe meteor shower depicted was the 2022 \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/leonids/in-depth/\">Leonids</a> which peaked earlier this month, and the view is from \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GANaIlOIjvA\">Hainan</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a> looking out over the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea\">South China Sea</a>.\n\nMeteor streaks captured over a few hours were isolated and added to a foreground image recorded earlier. \n\nFrom this place and time, \n<a href=\"ap061118.html\">Leonid meteors</a> that \n<a href=\"ap031116.html\">trace back</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/constellations/leo-heres-your-constellation/\">constellation of Leo</a> \nwere seen streaking across \n<a href=\"ap210112.html\">other constellations</a> including \n<a href=\"ap200919.html\">Orion</a>.\n\nThe bright red planet \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/\">Mars</a> appears near the top of the image.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cat-hug-11.jpg?w=1024\">Bonding</a> over their love of astronomy, the two pictured meteor enthusiasts, shown celebrating their \n<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-probability-birthday-paradox/\">common birthday</a> this month, are now married.",
