  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nA meteor, a comet, and a photogenic nebula have all been captured in this single image. \n\nThe closest and most fleeting is the streaking meteor on the upper right -- it was visible for less than a second.\n\nThe meteor, which disintegrated in Earth's atmosphere, was likely a small bit of \n<a href=\"ap111019.html\">debris</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap160202.html\">nucleus</a> of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21P/Giacobini%E2%80%93Zinner\">Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner</a>, coincidentally the comet captured in the same image.\n\nComet 21P, pictured across the inner \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">Solar System</a> from Earth, is distinctive for its long dust tail spread horizontally across the image center. \n\n<a href=\"ap180918.html\">This comet</a> has been visible with binoculars for the past few months but is \n<a href=\"http://195.209.248.207/en/observation/listObserv/257\">now fading</a> as it heads back out to the orbit of Jupiter. \n\nFarthest out at 3,500 light years distant is the IC 2177, the \n<a href=\"ap180316.html\">Seagull Nebula</a>, visible on the left. \n\nThe comparatively vast \n<a href=\"ap161215.html\">Seagull Nebula</a>, with a wingspan on order 250 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light-years</a>, will likely remain visible for hundreds of thousands of years. \n\nLong exposures, taken about two weeks ago from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48-bMQPkxiY\">Iwaki-City</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>, \nwere combined to capture the image's faintest elements. \n\nYou, too, could see a meteor like this -- and <a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/animaljam/images/e/e1/Surprised_cat.png/revision/latest?cb=20150603175417\">perhaps sooner</a> than you might think: tonight is the peak of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/small-bodies/meteors-and-meteorites/orionids/in-depth/\">Orionids</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.space.com/34373-orionid-meteor-shower-guide.html\">meteor shower</a>.",
