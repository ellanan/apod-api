  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nWhy would Venus appear oval?\n\n<a href=\"ap101020.html\">Venus</a> has been seen countless times from the surface of the Earth, and every time the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth\">Earth's atmosphere</a> \nhas dispersed its light to some degree.\n\nWhen the air has just the right amount of dust or water droplets, small but distant objects like Venus appear spread out into an angularly large aureole.\n\nAureoles are not unusual to see and are frequently noted as circular \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/cormoon.htm\">coronas</a> around the \n<a href=\"ap100208.html\">Sun</a> or \n<a href=\"ap081207.html\">Moon</a>.\n\nRecently, however, aureoles have been imaged that are not circular but distinctly \n<a href=\"http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/examples/mouse/paintdemo.html\">oval</a>.  \n\nThe above oval Venusian aureole was imaged by the \n<a href=\"http://www.twanight.org/zubenel\">astrophotographer</a> \nwho first noted the unusual phenomenon three years ago.\n\nInitially disputed, the\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz732.htm\">unusual distortion</a> has now been\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz196.htm\">confirmed multiple times</a> by several different astrophotographers.\n\nWhat causes the ellipticity is\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz505.htm\">currently unknown</a>, and although several \n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz732.htm\">hypotheses hold</a> \nthat horizontally oriented\n<a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz196.htm\">ice crystals are responsible</a>, significant\n<a href=\" http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=120213\">discussions</a> about it are still taking place.",
