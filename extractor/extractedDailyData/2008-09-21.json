  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nTomorrow is the \n<a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/AutumnalEquinox.html\">autumnal equinox</a> -- should \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)\">eggs</a> be able to stand on end?  \n\nThis long-standing \n<a href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_089.html\">myth</a> loses much of its mystique after a demonstration \nthat \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM8BXG1p1pA\">eggs can be made to stand on end</a> during any day of the year.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/egg_spin.html\">Pictured above</a>, Dr. Phil Plait, acting as the \n<a href=\"http://www.badastronomy.com/info/whois.html\">Bad Astronomer</a> balanced three raw \n<a href=\"ap030726.html\">egg</a>s on end in late October 1998.  \n\nLater, more modestly, his wife balanced five more. \n\nThe little-appreciated fact that most eggshells have \nsmall bumps on them makes this \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5QGCmnFV78\">seemingly impossible task</a> achievable.  \n\nAlthough, during an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">equinox</a>, \nevery place on Earth experiences an <a href=\"ap000923.html\">equal</a> \nlength day and night (12 hours each), this fact has no practical effect on \n<a href=\"http://www.clarkfoundation.org/astro-utah/vondel/equinoxver.html\">egg stability</a>.",
