  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis may be the best global Mars map made with a telescope based on\nplanet Earth.\n\nThe image data were captured by a team of observers over six long nights\nat the <a href=\"ap080125.html\">Pic du Midi</a> mountaintop observatory\nbetween October 8 and November 1,\nwhen the\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">fourth rock from the Sun</a>\nhad not wandered far from its 2020\nopposition and its biggest and brightest appearance in Earth's night sky.\n\nThe large telescope used, 1 meter in diameter with a 17 meter focal length,\nwas also used in support of NASA's Apollo lunar landing missions.\n\nAfter about 30 hours of processing, the data were combined\nto produced this remarkably sharp projected view of the martian surface\nextending to about 45 degrees northern latitude.\n\nThe image data have also been mapped onto\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5Km9LGPE0\">rotating sphere</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-OwMzdXhIE\">rotating stereo</a>\nviews.\n\nFans of Mars can easily pick out their favorite markings on the Red Planet\n<a href=\"ap201001.html\">by eyeing</a> a labeled version of this\n<a href=\"image/2011/marsglobalmaplegende.jpg\">global map of Mars</a>.",
