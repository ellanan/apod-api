Sharp are at the far right.\n\nImages to construct the panorama were recorded over 4\nconsecutive sols between local noon and 2pm to provide\nconsistent lighting.\n\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/curiositys-1-8-billion-pixel-panorama/?site=msl\">Zoom in to the panoramic scene</a>\nand you can easily spot the shadow casting\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarsDial\">sundial</a>\nmounted on rover's deck (right).\n\nIn July NASA plans to launch a\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/\">new\nrover to Mars named Perseverance.</a>",
