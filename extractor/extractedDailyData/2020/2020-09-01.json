  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDoes Ceres have underground pockets of water?\n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/ceres/overview/\">Ceres</a>, the largest asteroid in the \n<a href=\"https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level1/asteroids.html\">asteroid belt</a>, was thought to be composed of rock and ice.\n\nAt the same time, \n<a href=\"ap190616.html\">Ceres</a> was known to have unusual bright spots on its surface.\n\nThese \n<a href=\"ap150916.html\">bright spots were clearly imaged</a> during Dawn's \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrafypeEhTM\">exciting approach</a> in 2015.\n\nAnalyses of Dawn images and spectra indicated that the \nbright spots arise from the residue of highly-reflective salt water that used to exist on \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)#Observations_by_Dawn\">Ceres' surface</a> but evaporated.\n\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs...4..786D/abstract\">Recent analysis</a> indicates that some of this water \nmay have originated from deep inside the dwarf planet, indicating \nCeres to be a kindred spirit with several  \n<a href=\"ap180701.html\">Solar System moon</a>s, also thought to harbor deep water pockets.  \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2020-155\">featured video</a> shows in false-color pink the bright evaporated brine named \n<a href=\"ap180719.html\">Cerealia Facula</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occator_(crater)\">Occator Crater</a>. \n\nIn 2018, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(spacecraft)\">mission</a>-successful but \n<a href=\"https://media1.tenor.com/images/fa0263f9f3ff39f44a58ccb3aae12439/tenor.gif\">fuel-depleted</a> Dawn  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/the-legacy-of-nasa-s-dawn-near-end-of-mission\">spacecraft was placed</a> in a distant parking orbit, \nkeeping it away from the Ceres' surface for at least 20 years to avoid interfering with any \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/ceres-subsurface-salty-meltwater-deposits\">life that might there exist</a>.",
