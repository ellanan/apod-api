  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nWith its closest approach to planet Earth scheduled for November 14,\nthis Comet ATLAS (C/2020 M3) was discovered just this summer,\nanother comet found by the NASA funded\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_Terrestrial-impact_Last_Alert_System\">Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</a>\n\nIt won't get as bright\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-blogs/explore-night-bob-king/comets-crawl-through-the-skies-at-dawn-and-dusk/\">as Comet NEOWISE</a>\nbut it can still be spotted using binoculars, as it\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/comet-c-2020-m3-atlas-closest-to-earth-nov-14-2020\">currently sweeps through the familiar constellation of Orion.</a>\n\nThis telephoto field from November 8,\nblends exposures registered on the comet with exposures\nregistered on Orion's stars.\n\nIt creates an effectively deep skyview that shows colors and details you\ncan't quite see though, even in binoculars.\n\nThe comet's telltale greenish coma is toward the upper left, above\nOrion's three belt stars lined-up across the frame below center.\n\nYou'll also probably spot the Orion Nebula, and famous Horsehead Nebula\nin the stunning field of view.\n\n<a href=\"ap200919.html\">Of course one of</a>\nOrion's belt stars is nearly 2,000 light-years away.\n\nOn November 14,\n<a href=\"https://theskylive.com/how-far-is-c2020m3\">this comet ATLAS</a>\nwill fly a mere 2.9 light-minutes from Earth.",
