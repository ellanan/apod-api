  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nTaken over the course of an hour shortly after local midnight on December 13,\n35 exposures were used to create this postcard from Earth.\n\nThe composited night scene spans dark skies above the snowy Italian\nDolomites during our fair planet's\n<a href=\"https://www.amsmeteors.org/2020/12/viewing-the-geminid-meteor-shower-in-2020/\">annual Geminid meteor shower</a>.\n\nSirius, alpha star of Canis Major and the brightest star in the night,\nis grazed by a meteor streak on the right.\n\nThe Praesepe star cluster, also known as M44 or the Beehive cluster,\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/praesepe-beehive-cluster\">itself contains</a>\nabout a thousand stars but appears as a smudge of light far\nabove the southern alpine peaks near the top.\n\nThe shower's radiant is off the top of the frame though, near Castor and\nPollux the twin stars of Gemini.\n\nThe radiant effect is due to\nperspective as the parallel meteor tracks\n<a href=\"ap151217.html\">appear to converge</a>\nin the distance.\n\nAs Earth sweeps through the dust trail of asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/overview/\">dust that creates</a>\nGemini's meteors enters\nEarth's atmosphere traveling at about 22 kilometers per second.",
