  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWould you brave wild animals to photograph this sky?\n\nOne astrophotographer did -- and we all get to reap the rewards. \n\nFirst, thousands of stars were visible with many of the brightest impressively blue.\n\nNext, several red-glowing nebulae were discernible, including the \n<a href=\"ap190823.html\">California Nebula</a> on the far right, and, above it, the \n<a href=\"ap180823.html\">Heart and Soul nebulae</a>.\n\nBut the real reason to brave the local wildlife was \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-to-see-comet-neowise/\">Comet NEOWISE</a>, visible on the left. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"http://astro-fotografia.eu/2020/07/15/kometa-c-2020-f3-neowise-2/\">featured long-duration composite</a> taken last week,\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/whats-up-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/\">Comet NEOWISE</a>'s blue-glowing \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/Cometary+Gas+Tail\">ion tail</a> points straight up, away from the rising \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/\">Sun</a>, \nwhile the Sun-reflecting \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/cometary+dust+tail\">dust tail</a> \ntrails off toward the right. \n\nThe picture combines three exposures taken consecutively \nover 10 minutes from the same location near \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVPQZZL5Uv8\">Miedzygórze</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland\">Poland</a>. \n\nA moonlit dirt road shows the path ahead, while the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Anie%C5%BCnik_Mountains\">Śnieznik Mountains</a> is visible on the horizon.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2020_F3_(NEOWISE)\">Comet C/2020 F3</a> (NEOWISE) \npasses its closest to the Earth next week, after which the 5-km wide, evaporating, \n<a href=\"https://www.astrobio.net/meteoritescomets-and-asteroids/icy-dirtballs-not-dirty-snowballs/\">icy dirtball</a> will fade as it \n<a href=\"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=C%2F2020%20F3;old=0;orb=1;cov=0;log=0;cad=0\">glides back to the outer Solar System</a>.",
