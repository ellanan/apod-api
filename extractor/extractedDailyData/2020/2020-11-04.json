  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nOver fifty \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave\">gravitational wave</a> \nevents have now been detected.\n\nThese events mark the distant, violent collisions of \n<a href=\"ap151020.html\">two black holes</a>, \na black hole and a neutron star, or \n<a href=\"ap171016.html\">two neutron stars</a>. \n\nMost of the \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O3aCatalog/\">50 events</a> were detected in 2019 by the \n<a href=\"ap160207.html\">LIGO gravitational wave detector</a>s in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">USA</a> and the \n<a href=\"https://www.virgo-gw.eu/\">VIRGO</a> detector in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\">Europe</a>. \n\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O3aCatalog/images/Stellar_Graveyard_noerror_GWonly.png\">featured illustration</a> summarizing the masses of the first \n<a href=\"https://www.aei.mpg.de/549420/dozens-of-new-gravitational-wave-events-in-six-months\">50 events</a>, blue dots indicate higher-mass \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html\">black holes</a> while orange dots denote lower-mass \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/neutron_stars1.html\">neutron stars</a>.\n\nAstrophysicists are \n<a href=\"https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/f9769a59-a6b9-4e5e-8893-3ca270b404ce/EA145108-1AC0-4755-A73A-836CFD6EA571.jpeg\">currently uncertain</a>, though, about the \n<a href=\"ap200908.html\">nature of events</a> marked in \nwhite involving masses that appear to be in the middle -- \nbetween two and five solar masses. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap201021.html\">night sky in optical light</a> \nis dominated by nearby and bright planets and stars that have been known since the dawn of humanity.\n\nIn contrast, the \n<a href=\"ap170928.html\">sky in gravitational waves</a> \nis dominated by distant and dark \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole\">black holes</a>  \nthat have only been known about for less than five years.  \n\nThis contrast is enlightening -- understanding the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iphcyNWFD10\">gravitational wave</a> \nsky is already reshaping humanity's knowledge \nnot only of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">star</a> birth and death across the universe, but \n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06060\">properties</a> of the universe itself.",
