  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe month was July, the place was the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\">Greek</a> island of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/kbbkNlj5jOo\">Crete</a>, and the sky was spectacular.\n\nOf course there were the usual stars like \n<a href=\"ap991006.html\">Polaris</a>, \n<a href=\"ap150508.html\">Vega</a>, and \n<a href=\"ap180702.html\">Antares</a> -- and that common \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)\">asterism</a> \neveryone knows: the \n<a href=\"ap130421.html\">Big Dipper</a>.\n\nBut this sky was just getting started.  \n\nThe band of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/\">Milky Way Galaxy</a> \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/72/63/3f/72633fcf833f46966dbd380c1fd7339b--funny-kitties-cute-cats.jpg\">stunned</a> as it arched across the night like a \nbridge made of \n<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/universe/stars/\">stars</a> and \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Dust+Grain\">dust</a> \nbut dotted with red nebula like candy.\n\nThe planets \n<a href=\"ap201020.html\">Saturn and Jupiter</a> were so bright you wanted \nto stop people on the beach and point them out.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/why-nasa-watches-airglow-the-colors-of-the-upper-atmospheric-wind\">air glowed</a> like a \n<a href=\"ap140930.html\">rainbow</a> -- but what really grabbed the glory was a comet.\n\nJust above the northern horizon, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_NEOWISE\">Comet NEOWISE</a> spread its \n<a href=\"ap200722.html\">tails</a> like nothing you had ever seen before or might ever see again. \n\n<a href=\"https://media.tenor.com/images/6e1e57d33d62a9788cc07ae583d03184/tenor.png\">Staring in amazement</a>, there was only one thing to do: take a \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=3758707924148713&amp;set=a.577773782242159\">picture</a>.",
