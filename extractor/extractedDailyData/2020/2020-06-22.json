  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are those dark streaks in this composite image of yesterday's solar eclipse?\n\nThey are reversed shadows of mountains at the edge of the Moon. \n\nThe center image, captured from \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke5nVmMxIwY\">Xiamen</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>, \nhas the Moon's center directly in front of the Sun's center.\n\n<a href=\"https://moon.nasa.gov/\">The Moon</a>, though, was \n<a href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/sites/eclipse.aas.org/files/Total-Annular-TQ.jpg\">too far</a> from \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a> to completely block the entire Sun. \n\nLight that streamed around all of the edges of the Moon is called a  \n<a href=\"ap200615.html\">ring of fire</a>.\n\nImages at each end of the sequence show \n<a href=\"ap170301.html\">sunlight that streamed</a> through lunar valleys. \n\nAs the Moon moved further in front of the Sun, left to right, \nonly the higher peaks on the Moon's perimeter could block sunlight. \n\nTherefore, the dark streaks are projected, distorted, reversed, \nand magnified \n<a href=\"ap180507.html\">shadows of mountains</a> at the Moon's edge. \n\nBright areas are called \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads\">Baily's Beads</a>.\n\nOnly a narrow swath across Earth's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Hemisphere\">Eastern Hemisphere</a> \nwas able to see yesterday's full annular solar eclipse.\n\nNext June, though, a narrow swath across Earth's \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere\">Northern Hemisphere</a> \nwill be able to see the \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html\">next</a> annular solar eclipse. \n\nA <a href=\"ap190701.html\">total solar eclipse</a> \nwill be \n<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2020-december-14\">visible</a> at the \n<a href=\"ap170730.html\">bottom of the world</a> near the end of this year.",
