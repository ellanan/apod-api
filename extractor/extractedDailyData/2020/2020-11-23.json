  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhy do colorful cloud bands encircle Jupiter?\n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a>'s \ntop atmospheric layer is \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/multimedia/largest/atmosphere.html\">divided into light zones and dark belts</a> that go \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#/media/File:PIA02863_-_Jupiter_surface_motion_animation.gif\">all the way around</a> the giant planet.\n\nIt is high horizontal winds -- in excess of 300 kilometers per hour -- \nthat cause the zones to spread out planet-wide.\n\nWhat causes these strong winds remains a \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JGRE..12506292D/abstract\">topic of research</a>. \n\nReplenished by upwelling gas, zonal bands are thought to include relatively opaque clouds of \n<a href=\"ap200811.html\">ammonia</a> and water that \nblock light from lower and darker atmospheric levels. \n\nOne light-colored zone is shown in great detail in the \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmgill/48294907271/\">featured vista</a> taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/\">Juno spacecraft</a> in 2017. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter\">Jupiter's atmosphere</a> is mostly clear and colorless \n<a href=\"ap200809.html\">hydrogen and helium</a>, \ngases that are not thought to contribute to the gold and brown colors. \n\nWhat compounds create these colors is another active topic of research -- \nbut is hypothesized to involve small amounts of sunlight-altered \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/16.shtml\">sulfur</a> and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml\">carbon</a>.  \n\nMany discoveries have been made from Juno's data, including that \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/findings-from-nasas-juno-update-jupiter-water-mystery\">water composes</a> an unexpectedly high 0.25 percent of upper-level cloud molecules near Jupiter's equator, a finding important not only for understanding \n<a href=\"ap201019.html\">Jovian</a> currents but for the history of water in the entire \n<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/orrery/index.html#/home\">Solar System</a>.",
