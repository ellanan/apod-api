  "title": "Julius Caesar and Leap Days",
  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://uh.edu/engines/epi2364.htm\">In 46 BC Julius Caesar\nreformed the calendar system</a>.\n\nBased on advice by astronomer\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria\">Sosigenes\nof Alexandria</a>, the Julian calendar included\none <a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html\">leap\nday</a> every four years to account for the fact that an Earth\nyear is slightly more than 365 days long.\n\nIn modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun\nonce is 365.24219 mean solar days.\n\nSo if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift\nfrom the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and\neventually July (named for <a href=\"http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html\">Julius\nCaesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.\n\nBy adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, \nthe Julian calendar year would drift much less.\n\nIn 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days \nshould not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html\">Gregorian\nCalendar</a> system is the one in wide use today.\n\n<a href=\"ap171007.html\">Of course, tidal friction</a>\nin the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually\nlengthens the day by about 1.4 milliseconds per century.\n\nThat means that\n<a href=\"https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/02/29/the-physics-of-leap-day\">leap days\nlike today will not be necessary ... about 4 million years from now</a>.",
