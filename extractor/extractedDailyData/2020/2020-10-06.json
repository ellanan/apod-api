  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nLook to the east just after sunset tonight and you'll see a most impressive Mars.\n\nTonight, \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/all-about-mars/facts/\">Mars</a> \nwill appear its biggest and brightest of the year, as Earth passes closer to the \n<a href=\"https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/advice/skills/how-to-observe-mars/\">red planet</a> than it has in over two years -- and will be again for another two years. \n\nIn a week, \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/all-about-mars/night-sky/close-approach/\">Mars</a> will be almost as bright -- but at \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/12972/ringside-seats-for-saturn/\">opposition,</a> meaning that it will be directly opposite the Sun.\n\nDue to the slightly oval shape of the orbits of \n<a href=\"ap200802.html\">Mars and Earth</a>, \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/all-about-mars/night-sky/close-approach/\">closest approach</a> and opposition occur on slightly different days.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CFmgOannRTg/\">featured image sequence</a> \nshows how the angular size of \n<a href=\"ap201001.html\">Mars</a> has grown \nduring its approach over the past few months.\n\n<a href=\"https://amyhenrybooks.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/kitten-fluffy_orange_kitten.jpg\">Noticeably orange</a>, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> \nis now visible nearly all night long, \nreflecting more sunlight toward \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> than either \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a> or \n<a href=\"ap190908.html\">Jupiter</a>. \n\nEven at its closest and largest, though, \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/double-moon-on-august-27\">Mars</a> will still appear about \n<a href=\"ap200911.html\">100 times smaller</a>, in diameter, than a \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">full moon</a>.",
