  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat's behind Betelgeuse?\n\nOne of the brighter and more unusual stars in the sky, the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_supergiant_star\">red supergiant</a> \nstar Betelgeuse can be found in the direction of famous constellation Orion.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse\">Betelgeuse</a>, however, is actually \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD-5ZOipE48\">well in front</a> \nof many of the constellation's other bright stars, and also in front of the greater \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Molecular_Cloud_Complex\">Orion Molecular Cloud Complex</a>. \n\nNumerically, light takes about 700 years to reach us from Betelgeuse, but about 1,300 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">years to reach us</a> from the \n<a href=\"ap191030.html\">Orion Nebula</a> and its surrounding dust and gas. \n\nAll but the largest telescopes \n<a href=\"ap200101.html\">see Betelgeuse</a> as only a point of light, \nbut a point so bright that the \n<a href=\"https://telescopeschool.com/telescope-magnification-guide-where-does-it-get-blurry/\">inherent blurriness</a> created by the telescope and \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html\">Earth's atmosphere</a> make it seem extended. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.adamblockphotos.com/betelgeuse.html\">featured long-exposure image</a>, thousands of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy can be seen in the background behind Betelgeuse, as well as dark dust from the \n<a href=\"ap200329.html\">Orion Molecular Cloud</a>, and some red-glowing emission from hydrogen gas on the outskirts of the more distant \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh2-264\">Lambda Orionis Ring</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap200217.html\">Betelgeuse</a> has recovered from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse#/media/File:Betelgeuse_AAVSO_2019.jpg\">appearing unusually dim</a> over the past six months, but is still expected to explode in a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJPVuSNFxlY\">spectacular supernova</a> \nsometime in the next (about) 100,000 years.",
