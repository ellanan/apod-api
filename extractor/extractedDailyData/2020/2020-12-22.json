  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDust pillars are like \n<a href=\"ap201206.html\">interstellar mountains</a>.  \n\nThey survive because they are more dense than their \nsurroundings, but they are being slowly \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ChEHQUMEkXw\">eroded away</a> by a hostile environment.  \n\nVisible in the featured picture is the end of a \nhuge gas and dust pillar in the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-20-the-trifid-nebula\">Trifid Nebula</a>\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifid_Nebula\">M20</a>), \npunctuated by a smaller pillar pointing up and an unusual \n<a href=\"ap970619.html\">jet</a> pointing to the left.  \n\nMany of the dots are newly formed low-mass stars.\n\nA star near the small pillar's end is slowly being stripped of its \n<a href=\"ap060528.html\">accreting gas</a> \nby radiation from a tremendously brighter star situated off the \ntop of the image.  \n\nThe jet extends nearly a \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light-year</a> and would \nnot be visible without external illumination.  \n\nAs gas and <a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> evaporate from the pillars, \nthe hidden stellar source of this \n<a href=\"ap140204.html\">jet</a> will likely be uncovered, \npossibly over the next 20,000 years.",
