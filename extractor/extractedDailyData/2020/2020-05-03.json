  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat are these Earthlings trying to tell us? \n\nThe featured message was broadcast from \n<a href=\"ap100713.html\">Earth</a> towards the \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18009\">globular</a> star cluster \n<a href=\"ap100527.html\">M13</a> in 1974.  \n\nDuring the dedication of the \n<a href=\"ap981129.html\">Arecibo Observatory</a> - still one of \nthe largest single radio telescopes in the world - a string of 1's and 0's \nrepresenting the diagram was sent.   \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message\">This attempt at extraterrestrial communication</a> was mostly ceremonial - \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">humanity</a> regularly broadcasts radio and television signals\nout into space accidentally.  \n\nEven were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qQRQyEodsE\">this message</a> received, M13 is so far away we would \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/c6/86/e8c686cf79b830a7663432989d423ace.jpg\">have to wait</a> almost 50,000 years to hear an answer.   \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/arecibo-message\">featured message</a> gives a few simple facts about humanity and its \nknowledge: \nfrom left to right are numbers from one to ten, atoms including \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> and \n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml\">carbon</a>, \nsome interesting molecules, \n<a href=\"ap120821.html\">DNA</a>, a human with description, basics of our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/\">Solar System</a>, and basics of the sending telescope.  \n\nSeveral  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence#Ongoing_radio_searches\">searches for extraterrestrial intelligence</a> are currently underway, including \none where you can <a href=\"https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/\">use your own home computer</a>.",
