  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis surreal picture isn't from a special effects sci-fi movie.\n\nIt is a digital composite of frames of the\n<a href=\"ap130801.html\">real Andromeda Galaxy</a>,\nalso known as M31, rising over a real mountain.\n\nExposures tracking the galaxy and background stars\nhave been digitally combined with separate\nexposures of the foreground terrain.\n\nAll background and foreground\n<a href=\"image/2003/Weisshorn_Andromeda_final.gif\">exposures\nwere made back to back</a>\nwith the same camera and telephoto lens on the same night\nfrom the same location.\n\nIn the \"Deepscape\" combination they produce a stunning image that reveals\na range of brightness and color that your eye can't quite see on its own.\n\nStill, it does look like you could ride a cable car up this mountain\nand get off at the station right next to Andromeda.\n\nBut at 2.5 million light-years from Earth the big beautiful spiral\ngalaxy really is a little out of reach as a destination.\n\nDon't worry, though.\n\nJust wait 5 billion years and the\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2012/news-2012-20.html\">Andromeda Galaxy will come to you</a>.\n\nThis Andromeda Station is better known as Weisshorn, the highest peak of\nthe ski area in Arosa, Switzerland.",
