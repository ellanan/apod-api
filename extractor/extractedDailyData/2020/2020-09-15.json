  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nCould there be life floating in the atmosphere of Venus?\n\nAlthough \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/\">Earth's planetary neighbor</a> \nhas a surface considered too extreme for any known lifeform, Venus' upper atmosphere may be sufficiently mild for tiny airborne \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism\">microbes</a>.\n\nThis usually disfavored prospect took an \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/12/e1/1112e1c4d14fe99f59c4918658ce91d9.jpg\">unexpected upturn</a> yesterday with the announcement of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4\">discovery of Venusian phosphine</a>.\n\nThe chemical \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine\">phosphine</a> (PH3) is a considered a \n<a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/129/detecting-biomarkers-on-faraway-exoplanets/\">biomarker</a> because it seems so hard to create from \nroutine chemical processes thought to occur on or around a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_terrestrial_exoplanet_candidates\">rocky world</a> such as \n<a href=\"ap200603.html\">Venus</a> -- but it is known to be created by \n<a href=\"ap090830.html\">microbial life on Earth</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Global_view_uvi_Venus_(Akatsuki).jpg\">featured image</a> of Venus and its thick clouds was taken in two bands of \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves\">ultraviolet light</a> by\nthe Venus-orbing \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_(spacecraft)\">Akatsuki</a>, a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\">Japan</a>ese \nrobotic satellite that has been orbiting the cloud-shrouded world since 2015. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/science/venus-life-clouds.html\">phosphine</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/science/venus-clouds-potential-alien-life\">finding</a>, if confirmed, may set off renewed interest \nin searching for other indications of life floating high in the atmosphere of \n<a href=\" https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">our Solar System</a>'s second planet \n<a href=\"ap180204.html\">out from the Sun</a>.",
