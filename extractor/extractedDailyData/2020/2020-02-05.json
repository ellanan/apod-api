  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nDo we all see the same <a href=\"https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu\">Moon</a>?  \n\nYes, but we all see it differently.\n\nOne difference is the apparent location of the Moon against <a href=\"https://www.space.com/30417-parallax.html\">background stars</a> -- an effect known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax\">parallax</a>.\n\nWe humans use the parallax between our eyes to judge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception\">depth</a>.\n\nTo see <a href=\"http://www.etwright.org/astro/moonpar.html\">lunar parallax</a>, though, we need eyes placed at a much greater separations -- hundreds to thousands of kilometers apart. \n\nAnother difference is that observers around the Earth all see a slightly different face of our spherical Moon -- an effect known as <a href=\"ap120205.html\">libration</a>.\n\nThe featured image is a composite of many views across the Earth, \nas submitted to \n<a href=\"ap150616.html\">APOD</a>, of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/lunar-phases-and-eclipses/\">total lunar eclipse</a> of 2019 January 21. \n\nThese images are projected against the same background stars to illustrate both effects. \n\nThe accurate superposition of these images was made possible by a serendipitous <a href=\"ap190125.html\">meteorite impact on the Moon during the lunar eclipse</a>, labeled here <a href=\"http://astronomia-udea.co/principal/es/content/¡impacto-en-la-luna\">L1-21J</a> -- guaranteeing that these submitted images were all taken within a <a href=\"https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~srollins/courses/cs686-f08/web/notes/timesync.html\">split second</a>. \n\nWith the simultaneous observations made by independent amateur astronomers \nacross the globe, a group of astronomers were able to use \ntheir citizen-science images to narrow down the \n<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/492/1/1432/5682492\" i=\"\">location, orbit, and energy</a> of this rare event.",
