  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nBig, bright, beautiful\n<a href=\"ap130206.html\">spiral, Messier 106</a> dominates this cosmic\nvista.\n\nThe nearly two degree wide\n<a href=\"https://blog.naver.com/omololee/221208161212\">telescopic\nfield of view</a> looks toward the well-trained constellation\nCanes Venatici, near the handle of the Big Dipper.\n\nAlso known as NGC 4258, M106 is about 80,000 light-years across and\n23.5 million light-years away, the largest member of the\n<a href=\"http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/cvnii.html\">Canes\nII</a> galaxy group.\n\nFor a far far away galaxy, the distance to M106 is well-known\nin part because it can be\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6031\">directly measured</a>\nby tracking this galaxy's remarkable maser, or microwave laser emission.\n\nVery rare but naturally occurring, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_maser\">maser\nemission</a> is produced\nby water molecules in molecular clouds orbiting its\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1302/\">active\ngalactic nucleus</a>.\n\nAnother prominent spiral galaxy on the scene, viewed nearly\n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1503a/\">edge-on,\nis NGC 4217</a> below and right of M106.\n\nThe distance to NGC 4217 is much less well-known, estimated\nto be about 60 million light-years, but the bright\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike\">spiky</a>\nstars are in the foreground, well inside our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nEven the existence of galaxies beyond the Milky Way\nwas questioned 100 years ago in\n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate20.html\">astronomy's\nGreat Debate</a>.",
