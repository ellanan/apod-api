  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow similar is Jupiter's magnetic field to Earth's?\n\nNASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html\">Juno spacecraft</a> has found that Jupiter's magnetic field is \n<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/jupiter-wandering-magnetic-field/\">surprisingly complex</a>, so that the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jovian world</a> does not have single magnetic poles like our \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a>. \n\nA snapshot of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter\">Jupiter's magnetic field</a> at one moment in time, \nas animated from Juno data, appears in the \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA23229\">featured video</a>.\n\nRed and blue colors depict \n<a href=\"ap190908.html\">cloud-top</a> \nregions of strong positive (south) and negative (north) magnetic fields, \nrespectively.\n\nSurrounding the planet are imagined \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field\">magnetic field</a> \nlines.\n\nThe first sequence of the animated video starts off by \nshowing what appears to be a relatively \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole\">normal dipole field</a>, \nbut soon a \n<a href=\"ap160406.html\">magnetic region</a> \nnow known as the Great Blue Spot rotates into view, \nwhich is not directly aligned with \n<a href=\"ap100124.html\">Jupiter's rotation</a> poles. \n\nFurther, in the second sequence, the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N7nRh5v1Iw\">illustrative animation</a> takes us over one of Jupiter's spin poles where red magnetic hotspots are revealed to be extended and sometimes even annular. \n\nA better understanding of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasas-juno-finds-changes-in-jupiters-magnetic-field\">Jupiter's magnetic field</a> \nmay give clues toward a better understanding of \n<a href=\"ap021125.html\">Earth</a>'s \n<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/70/ce/c3/70cec30919aefe50ada3bd8e0e6239e6.jpg\">enigmatic</a> planetary \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/geomagnetic-field-orig_full.jpg\">magnetism</a>.",
