  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSome cloud patterns on Jupiter are quite complex.\n\nThe featured \n<a href=\"ap180521.html\">tumultuous clouds</a> \nwere captured in May by NASA's robotic \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html\">Juno spacecraft</a> currently orbiting \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/\">our Solar System</a>'s largest planet. \n\n<a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22949\">The image</a> was taken when Juno was only about 15,000 kilometers over \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/\">Jupiter</a>'s cloud tops, so close that less than half of the \n<a href=\"ap190908.html\">giant planet</a> is visible. \n\nThe rough white clouds on the far right are \n<a href=\"ap171214.html\">high altitude clouds</a> known as pop-up clouds. \n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/juno/in-depth/\">Juno's mission</a>, now extended into 2021, is to study \n<a href=\"ap181016.html\">Jupiter</a> in new ways.\n\nAmong many other things, Juno has been measuring Jupiter's gravitational field, finding \n<a href=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad12683c000032000b0e42.jpeg\">surprising evidence</a> that Jupiter may be mostly a liquid.",
