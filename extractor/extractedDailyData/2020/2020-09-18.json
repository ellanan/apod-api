  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html\">Peculiar</a>\nspiral galaxy Arp 78 is found within the boundaries of the head strong\n<a href=\"http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/ari/index.html\">constellation Aries</a>,\nsome 100 million light-years\n<a href=\"ap070712.html\">beyond</a> the\nstars and nebulae of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2019/hubble-spots-a-curious-spiral\">Also known as NGC 772</a>, the island universe is over\n100,000 light-years across and sports a single\nprominent outer spiral arm in\n<a href=\"http://azstarman.net/CDK/NGC772.htm\">this detailed cosmic portrait</a>.\n\nIts brightest\ncompanion galaxy, compact NGC 770, is toward the upper right\nof the larger spiral.\n\nNGC 770's fuzzy, elliptical appearance contrasts nicely\nwith a spiky foreground Milky Way star in matching yellowish hues.\n\nTracking along sweeping dust lanes and\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1748\">lined with</a> young blue star\nclusters, Arp 78's large spiral arm is likely due to\ngravitational tidal interactions.\n\nFaint streams of material seem to connect Arp 78 with its nearby\ncompanion galaxies.",
