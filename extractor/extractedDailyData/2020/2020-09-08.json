  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nHow do black holes like this form?\n\nThe two black holes that spiraled together to produce the gravitational wave event \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hpbmi8oPipY\">GW190521</a> were not only the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observations\">most massive black holes</a> ever seen by \n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/\">LIGO</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.virgo-gw.eu/\">VIRGO</a> so far, \ntheir masses -- 66 and 85 solar masses -- were unprecedented and unexpected.\n\nLower mass black holes, below about 65 solar masses are known to form in \n<a href=\"ap171016.html\">supernova explosions</a>. \n\nConversely, higher mass black holes, above about 135 solar masses, are thought to be created by \n<a href=\"ap170606.html\">very massive stars imploding</a> after they use up their weight-bearing nuclear-fusion-producing \n<a href=\"ap200809.html\">elements</a>.\n\nHow such \n<a href=\"https://cplberry.com/2020/09/02/gw190521-the-big-one/\">intermediate mass black holes</a> came to exist is yet unknown, although one hypothesis holds that they result from consecutive collisions of stars and black holes in dense star clusters.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ligo.org/detections/GW190521.php\">Featured is an illustration</a> \nof the black holes just before collision, annotated with arrows indicating their spin axes.\n\nIn the illustration, the spiral waves indicate the production of \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/en/\">gravitational radiation</a>, while the surrounding stars highlight the possibility that \n<a href=\"ap190414.html\">the merger</a> occurred in a \n<a href=\"ap190404.html\">star cluster</a>. \n\nSeen last year but emanating from an epoch when the universe \nwas only about half its present age \n(<a href=\"ap130408.html\">z</a> ~ 0.8), black hole merger \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW190521\">GW190521</a> \nis the farthest yet detected, \nto within measurement errors.",
