  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nAt sunset on December 6 a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Electron_rocket_launches\">\nRocket Lab Electron rocket was launched</a>\nfrom a rotating planet.\n\nWith multiple small satellites on board it\ndeparted on a mission to low Earth orbit dubbed\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RunningOutOfFingers&amp;src=typed_query\">Running Out of Fingers</a>\nfrom Mahia Peninsula on New Zealand's north island.\n\nThe fiery trace of the Electron's graceful launch arc is\ntoward the south in this southern sea and skyscape.\n\nDrifting vapor trails and rocket exhaust plumes catch the\nsunlight even as the sky grows dark though,\nthe setting Sun still shinning at altitude along the rocket's trajectory.\n\nFixed to a tripod, the camera's perspective\nnearly aligns the peak of the rocket arc with the South Celestial Pole,\n<a href=\"ap191130.html\">but no bright star</a>\nmarks that location in the southern hemisphere's evening sky.\n\nStill, it's easy to find at the center of the star trail arcs\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BrendanGullyPhotography/photos/a.185842878441001/992120201146594/?type=3&amp;theater\">in the timelapse composite</a>.",
