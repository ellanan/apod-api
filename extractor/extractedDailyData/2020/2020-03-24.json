  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens to a star that goes near a black hole?\n\nIf the star directly impacts a massive \n<a href=\"https://www1.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/blackholes.html\">black hole</a>, \nthen the star falls in completely -- and everything vanishes.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/black-holes-caught-act-swallowing-stars\">More likely</a>, though, the star goes close enough to have the \nblack hole's gravity pull away the outer layers of the star, or \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/tidal-disruption.html\">disrupt the star</a>.\n\nThen most of the star's gas does not fall into the \n<a href=\"ap191001.html\">black hole</a>. \n\nThese stellar \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event\">tidal disruption</a> events can be as bright as a supernova, \nand an increasing amount of them are being discovered by automated \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_survey#List_of_sky_surveys\">sky surveys</a>.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA20027\">featured artist's illustration</a>, a star has just passed a massive \n<a href=\"ap160212.html\">black hole</a> and sheds gas that continues to orbit. \n\nThe inner edge of a disk of gas and dust surrounding the black hole is heated by the \n<a href=\"ap151028.html\">disruption event</a> and may glow long after the star  \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVgGdmmczvU\">is gone</a>.",
