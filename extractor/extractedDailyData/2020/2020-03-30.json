  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat creates Saturn's colors? \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/12713966445/in/dateposted/\">featured picture</a> of Saturn only slightly exaggerates what a \n<a href=\"ap190818.html\">human</a> \nwould see if hovering close to the giant ringed world.    \n\nThe image was taken in 2005 by the robot \n<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEM9D2HHZTD_0.html\">Cassini spacecraft</a> that orbited \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/\">Saturn</a>\nfrom 2004 to 2017.  \n\nHere <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings\">Saturn's majestic rings</a> appear directly only as a curved line, \nappearing brown, in part, from its \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves\">infrared</a> glow.  \n\nThe rings best show their complex structure in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSbCqp_a3iE\">dark shadows</a> \nthey create across the upper part of the planet.   \n\nThe northern hemisphere of \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia06177.html\">Saturn can appear partly blue</a> for the same reason that \n<a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html\">Earth's skies can appear blue</a> -- molecules in the cloudless portions \nof both planet's atmospheres are better at scattering blue light than red.  \n\nWhen looking deep into \n<a href=\"ap051010.html\">Saturn's clouds</a>, however, the natural \ngold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant.   \n\nIt is <a href=\"http://honesttopaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/head-tilt.jpg\">not known</a> why <i>southern</i> Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- \none hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there.    \n\nIt is also \n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004cosp...35..466W/abstract\">not known</a> why some of Saturn's \n<a href=\"ap960803.html\">clouds are colored</a> gold.",
