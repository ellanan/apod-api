  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe constellation of Orion is much more than three stars in a row.\n\nIt is a direction in space that is \n<a href=\"ap150316.html\">rich</a> with impressive nebulas.\n\nTo better appreciate this well-known swath of sky, an \n<a href=\"https://volskiy.smugmug.com/Nebulas/i-8dZ6DdL/0/O/Orion_2787x2412px_25_percent_CR1_2_sRGB.jpg\">extremely long exposure</a> was taken over many clear nights in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAfter 212 hours of camera time and an \n<a href=\"https://catsareontop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bored-feature.jpg\">additional year</a> of processing, the featured 1400-exposure collage spanning over 40 times the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter\">angular diameter</a> of \n<a href=\"http://moon.nasa.gov/about.cfm\">the Moon</a> emerged. \n\nOf the many interesting details that have become visible, one that particularly draws the eye is \n<a href=\"ap090224.html\">Barnard's Loop</a>, the bright red circular filament arcing down from the middle.\n\nThe Rosette Nebula is <i>not</i> the giant red nebula near the top of the image -- that is a larger but lesser known nebula known as Lambda Orionis. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap150225.html\">Rosette Nebula</a> <i>is</i> visible, though: it is the red and white nebula on the upper left. \n\nThe bright orange star just above the frame center is \n<a href=\"ap100106.html\">Betelgeuse</a>, while the bright blue star on the lower right is \n<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/blue-white-rigel-is-orions-brightest-star\">Rigel</a>.\n\nOther famous nebulas visible include \nthe <a href=\"ap151030.html\">Witch Head Nebula</a>, \nthe <a href=\"ap141209.html\">Flame Nebula</a>, \nthe <a href=\"ap080422.html\">Fox Fur Nebula</a>, and, if you know just where to look, \nthe comparatively small <a href=\"ap150513.html\">Horsehead Nebula</a>.\n\nAbout those \n<a href=\"ap090210.html\">famous three stars</a> that cross the belt of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)\">Orion the Hunter</a> -- \nin this busy frame they can be hard to locate, but a \ndiscerning eye will find them just below and to the right of the image center.",
