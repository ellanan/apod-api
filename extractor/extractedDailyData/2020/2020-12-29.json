  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat does the Earth look like during a total solar eclipse?\n\nIt appears \n<a href=\"ap170820.html\">dark in the region where people see the eclipse</a>, \nbecause that's where the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/solar-eclipse-diagram.jpg\">shadow of the Moon</a> falls.\n\nThe shadow spot rapidly shoots across the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">Earth</a> \nat nearly 2,000 kilometers per hour, \ndarkening locations in its path -- typically for only a few minutes -- \nbefore moving on.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147659/shadows-from-a-solar-eclipse\">featured&nbsp;video</a> shows the Earth during the \n<a href=\"ap201218.html\">total solar eclipse earlier this month</a>. \n\nThe time-lapse sequence, taken from a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit\">geostationary satellite</a>, \nstarts with the \n<a href=\"ap170709.html\">Earth below showing night</a> \nbut the sun soon rises at the lower right. \n\n<a href=\"ap171127.html\">Clouds shift</a> as day breaks over the \n<a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot\">blue planet</a>.\n\nSuddenly the \n<a href=\"ap110102.html\">circular shadow</a> of the \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Snr73Og3Rbk?t=13\">Moon appears</a> \non the left and moves rapidly across \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America\">South America</a>, \ndisappearing on the lower right.  \n\nThe video ends as nightfall begins again. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list-total-solar.html\">next total solar eclipse</a> will occur next December -- \nbut be \n<a href=\"ap170730.html\">visible only from parts of Antarctica</a>.",
