  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThese people are not in danger.\n\nWhat is coming down from the left is just the Moon, far in the distance.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(goddess)\">Luna</a> appears so large here because she is being \n<a href=\"image/1806/Telescope_Teide.jpg\">photographed through a telescopic lens</a>. \n\nWhat is moving is mostly \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a>, whose spin causes \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">the Moon</a> to slowly disappear behind \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide\">Mount Teide</a>, \na volcano in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands\">Canary Islands</a> \noff the northwest coast of \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\">Africa</a>.\n\nThe people pictured are \n<a href=\"image/1806/teide_volcan_video.jpg\">16 kilometers away</a> and  \nmany are facing the camera because they are watching \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">the Sun</a> rise behind the photographer.\n\nIt is not a \n<a href=\"https://atworkandbored.com/jokes-inc/fun-pics/long-neck-cat-8110.jpeg\">coincidence</a> that a \n<a href=\"ap171203.html\">full moon</a> rises just when the \n<a href=\"ap160320.html\">Sun sets</a> because the Sun is always on the \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-earth/Moon_phases_drawing.gif\">opposite side</a> of the sky from a full moon.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/272723959\">featured video</a> \nwas made two years ago during the full \n<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2010/0526/What-is-a-milk-moon-anyway\">Milk Moon</a>. \n\nThe video is not <a href=\"ap170820.html\">time-lapse</a> -- \nthis was really how fast \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">the Moon</a> was setting.",
