  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat happens if you keep going north?\n\nThe direction north on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">the Earth</a>, the place on your horizon below the northern spin pole of the Earth -- around which other stars appear to \n<a href=\"ap010110.html\">slowly swirl</a>, will remain the same.\n\nThis spin-pole-of-the-north will never move from its fixed location on the sky -- night or day -- and its height will always match your \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude\">latitude</a>. \n\nThe further north you go, the higher the \n<a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/GeomagneticPoles.shtml\">north</a> \nspin pole will appear. \n\nEventually, if you can reach the \n<a href=\"https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/arctic-zone/gallery_np.html\">Earth's North Pole</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap190118.html\">stars will circle</a> a point directly over your head. \n\nPictured, a four-hour long stack of images shows \n<a href=\"ap191207.html\">stars trailing</a> in circles around this \n<a href=\"http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/astro/CS/CS.16.html\">north celestial pole</a>. \n\nThe bright star near the north \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole\">celestial pole</a> is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris\">Polari</a>s, known as the North Star. \n\nThe bright path was created by the astrophotographer's headlamp as he zigzagged up a hill just over a week ago in \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCUiCAnUC1g\">Lower Saxony</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>.\n\nThe astrophotographer can be seen, at times, in shadow.\n\nActually, the Earth has two spin poles -- and <a href=\"https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/two-grey-cats-sit-next-to-each-other-look-different-directions-stray-139618628.jpg\">much the same</a> would happen if you started below\nthe Earth's equator and \n<a href=\"ap200212.html\">went south</a>.",
