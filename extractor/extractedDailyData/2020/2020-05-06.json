  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is the cause of this unusual parabolic structure? \n\nThis illuminated cavity, known as \n<a href=\"https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/nebula-catalog/ldn.html\">LDN 1471</a>, was created by a newly forming \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">star</a>, \nseen as the bright source at the peak of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola\">parabola</a>. \n\nThis \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar\">protostar</a> \nis experiencing a \n<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023341\">stellar outflow</a> which is then interacting with the surrounding material in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_molecular_cloud\">Perseus Molecular Cloud</a>, \ncausing it to brighten. \n\nWe see only one side of the cavity -- the other side is hidden by dark \n<a href=\"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/dust.html\">dust</a>. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.mathwarehouse.com/quadratic/parabola/interactive-parabola.php\">parabolic shape</a> is caused by the widening of the \n<a href=\"ap200308.html\">stellar-wind</a> blown cavity over time.\n\nTwo additional structures can also be seen either side of the \n<a href=\"ap130904.html\">protostar</a>, these are known as \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object\">Herbig-Haro object</a>s, \nagain caused by the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding material. \n\nWhat causes the \n<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/striation#/media/File:Striation_II_(3770181363).jpg\">striations</a> on the cavity walls, though, \n<a href=\"https://mk0tdb1b9oe2980rm.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/images/library/puzzleddog.jpg\">remains unknown</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/48507562636/in/dateposted/\">featured image</a> was taken by NASA and ESA’s \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> after an original detection by the \n<a href=\"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/mission/32-The-Mission\">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.",
