  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat would it look like to fly through the distant universe?\n\nTo find out, a team of astronomers estimated the relative distances \nto over 5,000 galaxies in one of the most distant fields of galaxies ever imaged: the \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0611b/\">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field\">HUDF</a>).\n\nBecause it takes light a long time to cross the universe, most galaxies visible in the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDMp8a-YNe0\">featured video</a> \nare seen when the universe was only a fraction of its current age, were \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2004/28/video/b/\">still forming</a>, and have unusual shapes when compared to modern galaxies.\n\nNo mature looking spiral galaxies such as our \n<a href=\"ap050104.html\">Milky Way</a> or the \n<a href=\"ap130626.html\">Andromeda galaxy</a> yet exist.\n\nToward the end of the video the \n<a href=\"ap120813.html\">virtual observer flies</a> past the \n<a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/science/deep_fields/\">farthest galaxies</a> \nin the <a href=\"ap040929.html\">HUDF</a> field, recorded to have a \n<a href=\"ap130408.html\">redshift</a> past 8.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1806\">early class</a> of low luminosity \n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2004/28/text/\">galaxies</a> likely contained \n<a href=\"ap030610.html\">energetic stars</a> emitting light that \n<a href=\"https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/research/RTreionization\">transformed</a> much of the \nremaining <a href=\"ap020820.html\">normal matter</a> \nin the universe from a cold gas to a hot ionized \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)\">plasma</a>.",
