  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis telescopic close-up shows off the central regions of\notherwise faint emission nebula IC 410, captured under backyard\nsuburban skies with\n<a href=\"https://astrobackyard.com/filters-for-astrophotography/\">narrowband filters</a>.\n\nIt also features two remarkable inhabitants of the cosmic pond of gas\nand dust.\n\nBelow and right of center are the tadpoles of IC 410.\n\nPartly obscured by foreground dust, the nebula itself\nsurrounds <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5632\">NGC 1893, a young</a>\ngalactic cluster of stars.\n\nFormed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, the\n<a href=\"ap070726.html\">intensely hot, bright</a>\ncluster stars energize the glowing gas.\n\nComposed of denser cooler gas and dust,\nthe tadpoles are around 10 light-years long and are\nlikely sites of ongoing \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbdwTwB8jtc\">star\nformation</a>.\n\nSculpted by stellar winds and radiation their heads are outlined by\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/1995/news-1995-44.html\">bright ridges of ionized gas</a>\nwhile their tails trail away from the cluster's central young stars.\n\n<a href=\"ap170507.html\">IC 410</a> lies some 10,000 light-years away,\ntoward the <a href=\"ap140213.html\">nebula-rich constellation Auriga</a>.",
