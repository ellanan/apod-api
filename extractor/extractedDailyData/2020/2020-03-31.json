  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nIn how many ways does the center of our Galaxy glow? \n\nThis enigmatic region, about 26,000 \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html\">light years</a> \naway toward the constellation of the Archer \n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)\">Sagittarius</a>), \nglows in \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro\">every type of light</a> \nthat we can see. \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/galactic-center.html\">featured image</a>, high-energy \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays\">X-ray</a> \nemission captured by NASA's orbiting \n<a href=\"https://chandra.harvard.edu/about/\">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a> \nappears in green and blue, while low-energy \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves\">radio</a> \nemission captured by \n<a href=\"https://www.sarao.ac.za/about/sarao/\">SARAO</a>'s ground-based \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeerKAT\">MeerKAT</a> telescope array is colored red.\n\nJust on the right of the colorful \n<a href=\"ap190708.html\">central region</a> lies Sagittarius A (Sag A), \na strong radio source that coincides with \n<a href=\"ap130906.html\">Sag A*</a>, our \n<a href=\"ap180729.html\">Galaxy's central</a> supermassive black hole.\n\nHot gas surrounds Sag A, as well as a series of parallel radio filaments known as \n<a href=\"ap080427.html\">the Arc</a>, seen just left of the image center. \n\nNumerous unusual single radio filaments are visible around the image.\n\n<a href=\"ap180512.html\">Many stars</a> orbit in and around Sag A, as well as numerous small black holes and dense stellar cores known as \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/neutron_stars1.html\">neutron stars</a> and \n<a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs1.html\">white dwarfs</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center\">Milky Way's central</a> supermassive black hole is currently being imaged by the \n<a href=\"https://eventhorizontelescope.org/\">Event Horizon Telescope</a>.",
