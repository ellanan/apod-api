  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat is creating the structure in Comet NEOWISE's tails?\n\nOf the \n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/07/16/why-does-comet-neowise-have-two-tails/#6741a7ec2488\">two tails</a> evident, the blue ion tail on the left points directly away from the Sun and is pushed out by the flowing and charged solar wind.\n\nStructure in the \n<a href=\"ap170425.html\">ion tail</a> comes from different rates of expelled blue-glowing ions from the comet's nucleus, as well as the always complex and continually changing structure of our \n<a href=\"ap000318.html\">Sun's wind</a>.\n\nMost unusual for \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2020_F3_(NEOWISE)\">Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)</a>, though, is the wavy structure of its \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet#/media/File:Cometorbit01.svg\">dust tail</a>.\n\nThis dust \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comet-stick/en/\">tail</a> is pushed out by sunlight, \nbut curves as heavier \n<a href=\"ap010813.html\">dust particle</a>s are better able to resist \nthis light pressure and continue along a solar orbit. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/comet-neowise-goes-from-red-to-green-and-has-spiral-arms\">Comet NEOWISE</a>'s impressive dust-tail striations are \n<a href=\"https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/closeup-pug-emotion-on-yellow-260nw-482089210.jpg\">not fully understood</a>, \nas yet, but likely related to \n<a href=\"ap960414.html\">rotating streams</a> \nof sun-reflecting grit liberated by ice melting on its \n<a href=\"ap200712.html\">5-kilometer wide nucleus</a>. \n\nThe featured 40-image conglomerate, \n<a href=\"https://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/wp-content/uploads/1954_c641.jpg\">digitally enhanced</a>, \nwas captured three days ago through the dark skies of the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntx9XSOQzOI\">Gobi Desert</a> in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia\">Inner Mongolia</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\">China</a>.\n\n<a href=\"ap200714.html\">Comet NEOWISE</a> will make it \n<a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146996/comet-neowise-brightens-the-night\">closest pass to the Earth tomorrow</a> as it moves out from the Sun.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FFn4-kQPjzk\">The comet</a>, already fading but \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-to-see-comet-neowise\">still visible</a> to the unaided eye, should fade more rapidly as it recedes from the Earth.",
