  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThese two galaxies are far far away, 12 million light-years distant\ntoward the northern constellation of the Great Bear.\n\nOn the left, with grand spiral arms and bright yellow core\nis spiral galaxy <a href=\"ap190417.html\">M81</a>, some 100,000\nlight-years across. \n\nOn the right marked by red gas and dust clouds, is irregular galaxy\n<a href=\"ap190723.html\">M82</a>.  \n\nThe pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years.\n\n<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-11-astronomers-stellar-halo.html\">Gravity\nfrom each galaxy</a> has profoundly affected the other during\na series of cosmic close encounters.  \n\nTheir last go-round lasted about 100 million years and\nlikely raised density waves rippling around \nM81, resulting in the richness of \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0seVq5ydqzk\">M81</a>'s\nspiral arms.  \n\n<a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2001/news-2001-08.html\">M82</a>\nwas left  with violent star forming regions and \ncolliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.  \n\nIn the next few billion years, their\ncontinuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/31may_andromeda/\">single galaxy will remain</a>.",
