  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nStill bathed in sunlight, the\n<a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/\">International Space Station</a> arced through the evening sky over\nlake <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/hykHy38rtHxdSPT59\">Wulfsahl-Gusborn</a>\nin northern Germany, just after sunset on March 25.\n\nThe familiar constellation of Orion can be seen left of\nthe trail of the orbital station's bright passage.\n\nOn the right, Venus is the brilliant evening star above the western horizon.\n\nWith the camera fixed to a tripod, this scene was captured in\na series of five exposures.\n\nHow can you tell?\n\nThe short time delay between the end of one exposure and the beginning\nof the next leaves small gaps in the\n<a href=\"ap080604.html\">ISS light trail</a>.\n\nLook closely and you'll also see that the sky that appears to be\nabove the horizon is actually a reflection though.\n\nThe final image has been vertically inverted and the\nnight skyscape recorded in the\n<a href=\"image/2005/ISS-Lighttrail-Reflection.jpg\">mirror-like waters of the small lake</a>.",
