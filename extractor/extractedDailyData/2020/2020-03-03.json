  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if the only way to get back to Earth was to go around the far side of the Moon?\n\nSuch was the dilemma of the \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2222.html\">Apollo 13 Crew</a> in 1970 as they tried to \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13#/media/File:Apollo_13_timeline.svg\">return home</a> in their unexpectedly \n<a href=\"ap100417.html\">damaged spacecraft</a>.\n\nWith the Moon in the middle, their \n<a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap13fj/index.html\">perilous journey</a>\nsubstituted spectacular views of the \n<a href=\"ap161230.html\">lunar farside</a> for radio contact with NASA's \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/apollo-mission-control-reopens-in-all-its-historic-glory\">Mission Control</a>.\n\nThese views have now been \n<a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13537\">digitally recreated</a> \nfrom detailed images of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">Moon</a> taken by the robotic \n<a href=\"https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilifg26TZrI\">featured video</a> starts by showing Earth disappear behind a dark lunar limb, \nwhile eight minutes later the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/\">Sun</a> \nrises around the opposite side of the Moon and \nbegins to illuminate the Moon's unusual and \n<a href=\"ap010428.html\">spectacularly cratered</a> surface. \n\nRadio contact was only re-established several minutes after that, as a crescent \n<a href=\"ap181224.html\">Earth rose</a> into view. \n\nWith the gravity of the Moon and the advice of many industrious \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/members-of-apollo-13-team-reflect-on-nasas-finest-hour\">NASA engineers and scientists</a>, \na few days later \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGP4o272ac\">Apollo 13 opened its parachutes</a> over the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean\">Pacific Ocean</a> and \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13#/media/File:Apollo13_splashdown.jpg\">landed safely</a> back on \n<a href=\"ap070325.html\">Earth</a>.",
