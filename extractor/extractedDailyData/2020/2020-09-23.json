  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but have you ever seen the space station do this?\n\nIf you \n<a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\">know when and where to look</a>, \nwatching the bright \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) drift across your night sky is a \n<a href=\"ap140525.html\">fascinating sight</a> -- but not very unusual. \n\nImages of the ISS crossing in front of the half-degree \n<a href=\"ap190402.html\">Moon</a> or \n<a href=\"ap190715.html\">Sun</a> do exist, \nbut are somewhat rare as they take planning, timing, and patience to acquire. \n\nCatching the ISS crossing in front of \n<a href=\"ap080714.html\">minuscule Mars</a>, though, is on another level.\n\nUsing <a href=\"https://calsky.com/\">online software</a>, \nthe featured photographer learned that \nthe unusual transit would be visible only momentarily \nalong a very narrow stretch of nearby land spanning just 90 meters. \n\nWithin this stretch, the equivalent \n<a href=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/3ohc1eTesPXxSRVwNq/200w.webp\">ground velocity</a> of the passing ISS image would be \na quick 7.4 kilometers per <i>second</i>.\n\nHowever, with a standard camera, a small telescope, \nan exact location to set up his equipment, \nan exact direction to point the telescope, \nand sub-millisecond timing -- he created \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/oHcMvF-nP2s\">a video</a> \nfrom which the featured 0.00035 second exposure was extracted. \n\nIn the resulting \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/140032790@N06/50348180127/in/pool-apods/\">image capture</a>, details on both Mars and the ISS are visible simultaneously. \n\nThe \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/140032790@N06/50347996866/\">featured image</a> was acquired last Monday at 05:15:47 local time from just northeast of \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/YoTNUUV4Nik\">San Diego</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\">USA</a>. \n\nAlthough typically much smaller, angularly, than the \n<a href=\"ap200220.html\">ISS, Mars</a> is approaching its \nmaximum angular size in the <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/why-is-mars-sometimes-bright-and-sometimes-faint\">next few weeks</a>, because the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/\">blue planet</a> \n(Earth) is set to \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/all-about-mars/night-sky/opposition/\">pass its closest</a> to the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">red planet</a> \n(Mars) in their respective orbits around the Sun.",
