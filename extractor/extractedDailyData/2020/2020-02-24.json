  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYes, but could you get to work on time if the Moon looked like this?\n\nAs the photographer was preparing to drive to work, \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter6-6/\">refraction</a>, \n<a href=\"ap191022.html\">reflection</a>, and even \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/03_behaviors\">diffraction</a> of moonlight from millions of falling ice crystals turned the \n<a href=\"ap160201.html\">familiar icon of our Moon</a> into a \n<a href=\"ap180101.html\">menagerie of other-worldly halos and arcs</a>.\n\nThe featured scene was captured with \nthree combined exposures two weeks ago on a cold winter morning in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba\">Manitoba</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\">Canada</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/corcols.htm\">colorful rings</a> \nare a <a href=\"ap160111.html\">corona</a> caused by \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction\">quantum diffraction</a> \nby small drops of water or ice near the direction of the \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/\">Moon</a>.\n\nOutside of that, a \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/common.htm\">22-degree halo</a> \nwas created by moonlight refracting through six-sided cylindrical \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platcol.htm\">ice crystals</a>.\n\nTo the sides are \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_dog\">moon dogs</a>, caused by light refracting through thin, flat, \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/orplate.htm\">six-sided ice platelets</a> \nas they flittered toward the ground. \n\nVisible at the top and bottom of the \n<a href=\"ap150403.html\">22-degree halo</a> are upper and lower \n<a href=\"https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/column.htm\">tangent arcs</a>, \ncreated by moonlight refracting through nearly horizontal \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon\">hexagon</a>al ice cylinders.\n\nA few minutes later, from a field just off the road to work, \nthe halo and arcs had disappeared, the sky had returned to normal -- \nwith the exception of a \n<a href=\"ap090611.html\">single faint moon dog</a>.",
