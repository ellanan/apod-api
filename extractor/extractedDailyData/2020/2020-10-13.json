  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThree very different -- and very famous -- objects were all captured in a single frame last month.\n\nOn the upper left is the bright blue \n<a href=\"ap200909.html\">Pleiades</a>, perhaps the most famous cluster of stars on the night sky. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades\">Pleiades</a> (M45) is about 450 \n<a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/\">light years</a> away and easily found a \n<a href=\"ap151103.html\">few degrees from Orion</a>. \n\nOn the upper right is the \n<a href=\"ap200925.html\">expansive Andromeda Galaxy</a>, \nperhaps the most famous galaxy -- external to our own -- on the night sky. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy\">Andromeda</a> \n(M31) is one of few objects visible to the \nunaided eye where you can see light that is millions of years old. \n\nIn the middle is \n<a href=\"ap201006.html\">bright red Mars</a>, perhaps the most famous planet on the night sky.\n\nToday Mars is at \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/12972/ringside-seats-for-saturn/\">opposition</a>, meaning that it is opposite the Sun, \nwith the result that it is visible all night long.  \n\nIn the foreground is an ancient tomb in the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygians\">Phygria</a>n Valley in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a>. \n\nThe tomb, featuring \n<a href=\"https://dspace.ankara.edu.tr/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12575/60412/22557.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">two stone lions</a>, \nis an impressive remnant of a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygians#History_2\">powerful civilization</a> \nthat lived thousands of years ago. \n\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a>, currently \n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/double-moon-on-august-27\">near its brightest</a>, can be \n<a href=\"ap180709.html\">easily found</a> toward the east just after sunset.",
