  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/nasaathome/index.html\">Since</a>\nthe early days of radio and television\nwe have been freely\n<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996GeoRL..23.1287K/abstract\">broadcasting</a>\nsignals into space.\n\nFor some time now, we have been\n<a href=\"https://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_ham.shtml\">listening</a>\ntoo.\n\nA large radio telescope at Ohio State University known as\naffectionately <a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/\">The Big Ear</a>\nwas one of the first listeners.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/kraus.htm\">The Big Ear was</a> \nabout the size of three\nfootball fields and consisted of an immense metal ground plane with \ntwo fence-like reflectors, one fixed and one tiltable.\n\nIt relied on the Earth's\n<a href=\"ap200417.html\">rotation</a> to help\nscan the sky.\n\nThis photo, taken by former Big Ear student volunteer Rick Scott,\nlooks out across the ground plane toward the fixed reflector with the\nradio frequency receiver horns in the foreground.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/past.htm\">Starting</a> in 1965, the Big Ear\nwas used in an ambitious survey of the radio sky.\n\nIn the 1970s, it became the first telescope to\ncontinuously listen for\n<a href=\"https://www.seti.org/\">signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.</a>\n\nFor an exciting moment during August 1977 a very\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/wowmenu.htm\">strong, unexpected signal</a>,\ndubbed\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm\">the Wow! Signal</a>,\nwas detected by the Big Ear.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/Wow30th/wow30th.htm\">But alas,\nheard only once</a>,\nthe source of the signal could not be determined.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bigear.org/flatdown.htm\">In May 1998</a>\nthe final pieces of the Big Ear were torn down.\n\n<br><br>",
