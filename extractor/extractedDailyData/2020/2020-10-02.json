  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/harvest-moon-2\">As you watched October's</a>\nfirst Full Moon rise last night, the Full Moon\nclosest to the northern autumnal equinox, you were\nprobably asking yourself,\n\n\"How long would it take to bike to the Moon?\"\n\nSure, Apollo 11 astronauts made the trip in 1969, from launch to\n<a href=\"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html\">Moon landing</a>,\nin about 103 hours or 4.3 days.\n\nBut the Moon is 400,000 kilometers away.\n\nThis year, the top bike riders in planet Earth's well-known\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tour_de_France\">Tour de France</a>\nrace covered almost 3,500 kilometers in 21 stages after about\n87 hours on the road.\n\nThat gives an average speed of about 40 kilometers per hour and a lunar\ncycling travel time of 10,000 hours, a little over 416 days.\n\nWhile this bike rider's\n<a href=\"ap981212.html\">destination</a> isn't clear, his journey did begin\naround moonrise on September 27 near Cleeve Hill, Bishops Cleeve,\nCheltenham, UK.",
