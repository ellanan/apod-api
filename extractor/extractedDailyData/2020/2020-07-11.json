  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nComet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) is\n<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-neowise-delights-at-dawn/\">now sweeping through northern skies</a>.\n\nIts\n<a href=\"http://spaceguard.rm.iasf.cnr.it/NScience/neo/neo-what/com-tail.htm\">developing tails</a>\nstretch some six degrees across this telescopic\n<a href=\"image/2007/Map_NEOWISE.jpg\">field of view</a>, recorded\nfrom Brno, Czech Republic before daybreak on July 10.\n\nPushed out by the pressure of\nsunlight itself, the comet's broad, yellowish \ndust tail is easiest to see.\n\nBut the image also captures a fainter, more bluish tail too,\nseparate from the\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-parker-solar-probe-spies-newly-discovered-comet-neowise/\">reflective comet dust</a>.\n\nThe fainter tail is an ion tail, formed as ions from the\ncometary coma are dragged outward by magnetic fields in the solar wind\nand fluoresce in the sunlight.\n\nIn this sharp portrait of\nour new visitor from the outer Solar System,\nthe tails of comet NEOWISE are\nreminiscent of the even brighter tails of Hale Bopp, the\n<a href=\"ap131013.html\">Great Comet of 1997</a>.",
