  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nSometimes, even rovers on Mars stop to admire the scenery.\n\nJust late last November the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity rover</a> on \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a> paused to photograph its \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/8559/sols-2597-2599-a-bounty-of-targets/\">impressive surroundings</a>.\n\nOne thing to admire, straight ahead, was \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/8542/sols-2577-2578-en-route-around-central-butte/\">Central Butte</a>, \nan unusual \n<a href=\"ap161005.html\">flat hill</a> \nstudied by Curiosity just a few days before this image was taken.\n\nTo its right was distant \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sharp\">Mount Sharp</a>, \nthe five-kilometer central peak of entire \n<a href=\"ap110729.html\">Gale crater</a>, \nthe interior of which Curiosity is exploring.\n\nMount Sharp, covered in \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate\">sulfates</a>, appears quite bright in \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasappere/49380893923/in/dateposted-public/\">this colorized, red-filtered image</a>.\n\nTo the far left, shrouded in a very dark shadow, was the south slope of \n<a href=\"ap180910.html\">Vera Rubin ridge</a>, \nan elevation explored previously by Curiosity. \n\n<a href=\"ap191220.html\">Between the ridge and butte</a> \nwere tracks left by Curiosity's wheels as they rolled forward, \nout of the scene.\n\nIn the image foreground is, of course, \nhumanity's current eyes on Mars: \nthe complex robotic rover \n<a href=\"ap171120.html\">Curiosity itself</a>. \n\nLater this year, if all goes well, \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> \nwill have \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SFh4TZRXHg\">another rover</a> \n-- and more eyes -- on Mars.\n\nToday you can \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/\">help determine the name of this rover</a> yourself, \nbut tomorrow is the last day to cast your vote.",
