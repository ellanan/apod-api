  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nYou need to be in the south, looking south, to see such a sky. \n\nAnd only then if you're lucky. \n\nJust above the picturesque tree is the impressive \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula\">Carina Nebula</a>, \none of the few nebulas in the sky that is visible to the unaided eye. \n\nThe featured image had to be taken from a very dark location to capture the \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BybE1Le14\">Carina Nebula</a> \nwith such perspective and so near the horizon. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap190507.html\">Great Nebula in Carina</a>, \ncataloged as NGC 3372, is home to the wildly variable star \n<a href=\"ap190220.html\">Eta Carinae</a> \nthat sometimes flares to become one of the brightest \n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve\">stars</a> in the sky. \n\nAbove Carina is \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2944\">IC 2944</a>, the \n<a href=\"ap200420.html\">Running Chicken Nebula</a>, a nebula \nthat not only looks like a chicken, but contains \n<a href=\"ap160120.html\">impressive dark knots</a> of dust. \n\nAbove \n<a href=\"ap190426.html\">these red-glowing</a> \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Emission+Nebula\">emission nebula</a>s are the bright stars of the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux\">Southern Cross</a>, \nwhile on the upper left of the image is the dark \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalsack_Nebula\">Coalsack Nebula</a>.\n\nThis image was composed from six consecutive exposures \ntaken last summer from \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padre_Bernardo\">Padre Bernardo</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A1s\">Goiás</a>, \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil\">Brazil</a>. \n\nEven with careful planning, \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jlLYWGgxFYk\">the astrophotographer</a> \nfelt lucky to get this shot because clouds -- \nsome still visible near the horizon -- kept <a href=\"https://dogcatselfie.com/content/uploads/images/April2018/30728014_771302106392915_614070389345091584_n.jpg\">getting in the way</a>.",
