  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhat if you could fly around Mars? \n\nNASA may have achieved that capability last month with the \n<a href=\"ap210223.html\">landing of Perseverance</a>, a rover which included a small flight-worthy companion called \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/\">Ingenuity</a>, nicknamed Ginny.\n\nEven though Ginny is small -- a \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/6-things-to-know-about-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter\">toaster-sized helicopter</a> with four long legs and two even-longer \n(1.2-meter) rotors, she is the first of \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25043/mars-ingenuity-helicopter-3d-model/\">her kind</a> -- \nthere has never been anything like her before.  \n\nAfter being deployed, possibly in April, the \n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-mars-perseverance-rover-gets-its-sample-handling-system\">car-sized Perseverance</a> (\"Percy\") \nwill back away to give Ginny ample room to attempt her \n<a href=\"https://www.aviationtoday.com/2021/02/23/nasas-ingenuity-first-aircraft-fly-mars/\">unprecedented first flight</a>.  \n\nIn the \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25116/a-mars-rover-and-a-mars-flyer-artists-concept/\">featured artistic illustration</a>, Ginny's long rotors are depicted \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/multimedia/videos/movies/MarsHelicopterTrailer/MarsHelicopterTrailer-640.mp4\">giving her the</a>  \n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-helicopter-58.html\">lift</a> \n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/multimedia/videos/movies/MarsHelicopterTrailer/MarsHelicopterTrailer-640.mp4\">she needs</a> to fly into the \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars\">thin Martian atmosphere</a> and explore the area near Perseverance. \n\nAlthough <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)#/media/File:Anatomy_of_the_Mars_Helicopter.png\">Ingenuity herself</a> will not fly very far, \nshe is a prototype for all future airborne Solar-System robots that may fly far across not only \n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\">Mars</a>, but \n<a href=\"ap190703.html\">Titan</a>.",
