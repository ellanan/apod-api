  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/usa/images/potw1820a/\">Dodging\npowerful laser beams</a>,\na drone captured this stunning aerial view.\n\nThe confrontation took place above the 8.2 meter diameter\nVery Large Telescopes of the\nParanal Observatory <a href=\"ap120421.html\">on planet Earth</a>.\n\nFiring during a test of the observatory's 4 Laser Guide Star Facility,\nthe lasers are ultimately battling against\nthe blurring effect of\natmospheric turbulence by creating artificial guide stars.\n\nThe guide stars are actually emission from laser excited sodium atoms at\nhigh altitudes within the\n<a href=\"ap170329.html\">telescopic field of view</a>.\n\nGuide star image fluctuations are used in real-time to correct for\natmospheric blurring by controlling a deformable mirror in the\ntelescope's optical path.\n\nKnown as\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDGvNyVApgg\">adaptive optics</a>,\nthe technique can produce images\n<a href=\"ap150507.html\">at the diffraction limit</a> of the telescope.\n\nThat's the same sharpness you would get if the\n<a href=\"http://spacetelescopelive.org/\">telescope were in space</a>.",
