  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nWhere did all the stars go?  \nWhat used to be considered a hole in the sky \nis now known to astronomers as a <a href=\"http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1997/34/af2.html\">dark molecular cloud</a>.  \n\nHere, a high concentration of \n<a href=\"ap990509.html\">dust</a> and \n<a href=\"ap970430.html\">molecular gas</a> \nabsorb practically all the visible light \nemitted from background stars.  \nThe eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors of \n<a href=\"http://dept.physics.upenn.edu/~myers/ASTR001/L25.html\">molecular clouds</a> some of the coldest \nand most isolated places in the universe.  \n\nOne of the most notable of these \n<a href=\"index/DarkNebulae.html\">dark absorption nebulae</a> \nis a cloud toward the constellation \n<a href=\"http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/ophiuchus.html\">Ophiuchus</a> known as Barnard 68, \n<a href=\"http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1999/phot-20-99.html\">pictured above</a>.  \n\nThat no stars are visible in the center indicates that \n<a href=\"http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/virtualmuseum/Barnard.html\">Barnard</a> 68 is relatively nearby, \nwith measurements placing it about \n500 light-years away and half a light-year across.  \n\nIt is not known exactly how \n<a href=\"http://origins.jpl.nasa.gov/poster/bigbang3.html\">molecular clouds</a> \nlike Barnard 68 form, but it is known that \nthese clouds are themselves \n<a href=\"ap990502.html\">likely places</a> \nfor new stars to form.",
