  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\nThe brightest <a href=\"http://medicine.wustl.edu/~kronkg/comintro.html\">comet</a> in the sky right now is <a href=\"http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/whats_visible.html#1998P1\">Comet Williams</a>.  Moving slowly though the <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html\">constellation</a> of <a href=\"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Centaurus.html\">Centaurus</a>, Comet Williams, at \n<a href=\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML\">magnitude</a> 8, is visible to \n<a href=\"ap951222.html\">Southern Hemisphere</a> \nobservers with binoculars. In ten days, \n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/1998P1.html\">Comet Williams</a> will reach its closest point to the Sun, \nalthough it will still be farther from the Sun than the Earth.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.drdale.com/comets/index.htm\">Comet Williams</a> should become visible to many \nNorthern Hemisphere observers in late November.  \nAt magnitude 10, however, \nit might require a small telescope to see.  \n\n<a href=\"http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06900/06986.html\">Comet Williams</a> was discovered in early \nAugust by Peter Williams.  The \n<a href=\"http://www.ozemail.com.au/~loomberah/williams.htm\">above image</a> was taken August 25th from Australia.",
