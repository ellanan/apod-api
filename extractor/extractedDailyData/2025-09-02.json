  "explanation": "<b>  </b> \nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_nebula\">Horsehead\nNebula</a> is one of the most famous nebulae on the sky.  \n\nIt is visible as the dark indentation to the orange\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula\">emission nebula</a> \nat the far right of the \n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DFRDLZ0uUoF/\">featured picture</a>. \n\nThe <a href=\"ap140728.html\">horse-head</a> \nfeature is dark because it is really an opaque\n<a href=\"ap030706.html\">dust</a> cloud that lies in\nfront of the bright \n<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/emission+nebula\">emission nebula</a>.\n\nLike clouds in\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-atmospheric-layers-3/\">Earth's atmosphere</a>, this cosmic cloud has assumed a\n<a href=\"ap240114.html\">recognizable shape</a> by chance.  \n\nAfter \n<a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0272/4770/6214/articles/do-cats-get-bored-800x533.jpg\">many thousands of years</a>, the internal motions of the cloud\nwill surely alter its appearance. \n\nThe emission <a href=\"ap061015.html\">nebula</a>'s orange color is caused by \n<a href=\"https://history.aip.org/exhibits/electron/\">electrons</a> recombining with \n<a href=\"https://home.cern/news/news/physics/proton-century\">protons</a> to form\n<a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml\">hydrogen</a> atoms. \n\nToward the lower left of the image is the \n<a href=\"ap210412.html\">Flame Nebula</a>, \nan orange-tinged nebula that also contains intricate \nfilaments of dark dust.",
