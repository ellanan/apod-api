  "explanation": "<b>  </b>\n\nWhat will passenger airplanes be like in the future?\n\nTo help brain storm desirable and workable attributes, NASA sponsors\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/future_airplanes.html\">design competitions</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1698.html\">Shown here</a> is an artist's depiction of a concept plane\nthat has been recently suggested.\n\nThis futuristic plane would be expected to achieve\n<a href=\"ap070819.html\">supersonic speeds</a>,\npossibly surpassing the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX04ySm4TTk\">speeds</a> of the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_transport\">supersonic transport</a> planes that ran commercially in the late\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_century\">twentieth century</a>.\n\nIn terms of noise reduction, the future aircraft has been drawn featuring an\n<a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/q2u1414284747r2p/\">inverted\nV wing</a> stretched over its engines.\n\nThe structure is intended to\n<a href=\"http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/\nsupersonic-concept-plane-shush-sonic-booms-100630.html\">reduce the sound</a>\nfrom annoying sonic booms.\n\nAdditionally,\n<a href=\"http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/nra_awardees_10_06_08_d.htm\">\nfuture airplanes</a> would aim to have relatively little impact on\nour environment, including\n<a href=\"http://www.thegreenguide.com/\">green</a> limits\non pollution and fuel consumption.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/news/2932316\">Aircraft utilizing similar design concepts</a>\nmight well become operational by the 2030s.",
