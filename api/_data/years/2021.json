    "explanation": "<b>  </b> \n\nThis timelapse gif tracks the\n<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> as\nit streaks across the stars of Orion on its journey to a destination\nbeyond the Moon.\n\nRecorded on December 28, 12 consecutive exposures each 10 minutes long\nwere aligned and combined with a subsequent color image of the background stars\nto create the animation.\n\nAbout 2.5 days after its December 25 launch, JWST cruised past\n<a href=\"ap201002.html\">the altitude</a>\nof the Moon's orbit as it climbed up the gravity ridge\nfrom Earth to reach a halo orbit around L2, an\n<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/754/what-is-a-lagrange-point/\">Earth-Sun Lagrange point</a>.\n\nLagrange points are convenient locations in space where\nthe combined gravitational attraction of one massive body (Earth)\norbiting another massive body (Sun)\nis in balance with the centripetal force needed to\n<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Lagrangian_points_equipotential.gif\">move along with them</a>.\n\nSo much smaller masses, like spacecraft, will tend to stay\nthere.\n\nOne of 5 Lagrange points, L2 is about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth\ndirectly along the Earth-Sun line.\n\nJWST will arrive at L2 on January 23, 29 days after launch.\n\nWhile relaxing in Earth's surface gravity you can follow the James Webb\nSpace Telescope's\n<a href=\"https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html\">progress\nand complicated deployment online</a>.",
